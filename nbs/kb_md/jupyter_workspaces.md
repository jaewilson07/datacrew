## Intro

Jupyter Workspaces in Domo is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. Workspaces are tightly integrated with Domo to allow users to easily explore their Domo DataSets, leverage instantaneous code execution to develop pipelines for data science and machine learning, document their processes, create custom visualizations, and write transformed data back into Domo.

Jupyter Workspaces use the JupyterLab interface. For more information on JupyterLab, see [JupyterLab Documentation.](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)



**Important:** Jupyter is a premium Domo feature. Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Executive (AE) to get access. For help, reach out to [support@domo.com](mailto:support@domo.com)

## Required Grants

To access Jupyter, you will need one of two grants enabled: Create Jupyter Workspace or Manage Jupyter Workspace. Grants can be added to a custom user role.

#### Create Jupyter Workspace

- Allows you to create, edit and delete Jupyter Workspaces to which you have access.

#### Manage Jupyter Workspace (Jupyter Admin)

- Allows you to view, edit and delete any Jupyter Workspaces in the instance. This grant is needed to enable workspace sharing for other users.

## Enabling Jupyter

In order to start using Jupyter, a Jupyter Admin must enable the feature for your instance.

1. In the navigation header, go to **More** > **Admin**.

2. Under **Features,** select**Jupyter**from the options.

3. Activate the feature by adjusting the toggle next to **Jupyter Account Inactive.**

Your account is activated.

4. After activating the account, choose the account plan you want:

- The Default account plan allows all users access to Jupyter and gives all users unlimited usage.
- The Manual account plan allows specific users access to Jupyter and gives you the option to configure usage limits.

## Jupyter Basics

#### Reading Data

Data can be read into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library. This library provides useful functionality to interact with Domo within Jupyter. Before data can be read into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library, your workspace must have an input data source.

If you are creating a new workspace, see the earlier section, [Creating a Workspace.](#h_01GFM312NAT0DVK1M71BASZ56C)

If your workspace already exists but doesn't have an input data source, follow the steps below:

1. In Jupyter Workspaces, locate your workspace from the list. You can search and filter by owner.

2. Hover over your workspace. The ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS) **Manage Workspace** menu displays.

3. Select the ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS) **Manage Workspace** menu and choose **Edit**.

The **Edit Jupyter Workspace** modal displays.

4. In the **Edit Jupyter Workspace** view, select **Add Input DataSet**and choose a data source to be read into a Jupyter Notebook.

5. After choosing a DataSet, select **Save Workspace.**

The workspace has an input DataSet, and data can now be read into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library. All DataSets used in the workspace are located in **Data** > **DataSets.**

6. Use the `domo.read_dataframe` command to read data from a Domo data source into your Jupyter Notebook for further processing and analysis.

See the example below: ![readingdata.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkG)

#### Writing Data

Data can be written back to a Domo data source using the domojupyter library. This library provides useful functionality to interact with Domo within Jupyter. Before data can be written into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library, your workspace must have an output data source.

If you are creating a new workspace, see the earlier section, [Creating a Workspace.](#h_01GFM312NAT0DVK1M71BASZ56C)

If your workspace already exists but doesn't have an output data source, follow the steps below:

1. In Jupyter Workspaces, locate your workspace from the list. You can search and filter by owner.

2. Hover over your workspace. The ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS) **Manage Workspace** menu displays.

3. Select ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS) **Manage Workspace** menu and choose **Edit**.

The **Edit Jupyter Workspace** modal displays.

4. In the **Edit Jupyter Workspace** view, select **Add Output DataSet** and choose a data source to be written into a Jupyter Notebook.

5. After choosing a DataSet, select **Save Workspace.**

The workspace has an output DataSet, and data can now be written into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library. All DataSets used in the workspace are located in **Data** > **DataSets.**



**Note:** A new dataset is created for each added output.

6. Use the `domo.write_dataframe`command to write results back to the Domo Data sources configured for the Jupyter workspace.

See the example below: ![writingdata.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkY)

#### Using Accounts

Third-party accounts can be referenced in a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library. This library provides useful functionality to interact with Domo within Jupyter. Before account keys and values can be accessed, your workspace must have an account.

If you are creating a new workspace, see the earlier section, [Creating a Workspace.](#h_01GFM312NAT0DVK1M71BASZ56C)

If your workspace already exists but doesn't have a third-party account attached, follow the steps below:

1. In Jupyter Workspaces, locate your workspace from the list. You can search and filter by owner.

2. Hover over your workspace. The ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS)**Manage Workspace** menu displays.

3. Select the ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS)**Manage Workspace** menu and choose **Edit**.

The **Edit Jupyter Workspace** modal displays.

4. In the **Edit Jupyter Workspace** view, select **Accounts** > **Add Account**and select a third-party account.

5. After making your selection, select **Save Workspace.**

The workspace has a third-party account set up. Keys and values can now be read into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library.

6. The following commands can be used to get account information:

- `domo.get_account_property_value('account')` will return the specific value assigned to a property on your account.
- `domo.get_account_property_value('account',account_properties[0])` will return all properties that exist in an account.

See the example below, where 'S3Account' is the account being referenced:

![Screen_Shot_2022-10-17_at_4.03.43_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkT)

#### Installing and Using Libraries

Libraries can be installed in the Jupyter workspace by opening a terminal and executing the appropriate commands. An example command to install the Seaborn library is `conda install seaborn -y`. Once installed, these libraries can be imported and used within the Jupyter Notebooks.

See the example below:![installingandusinglibraries.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkW)

#### Scheduling a Notebook

Schedule a Jupyter notebook by selecting the **dataflow** option within the Juptyer Notebook interface.

![schedulinganotebook.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkQ)



Once selected, you will be presented with the option to create a Jupyter Dataflow. Enter a **Name**, **Description**, and desired scheduling options. Select **Save**.![createdataflow.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkJ)

Once saved, you will see the data flow in the **DataFlows** section of the Data Center. ![dataflowui.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkM)

You can navigate back to the Jupyter Workspace by Selecting the **Edit in Jupyter** button in the details view of the data flow.

![editinjupyter.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkN)

## Usage Monitoring

You can monitor Jupyter usage within Domo. As a prerequisite, you need to be assigned either the default Admin role or a custom role with the View Usage Metrics and Manage Jupyter Workspaces grants.

Follow the steps below to create a custom role with usage-based billing access.

1. Clone an existing role such as the default Admin role.
2. Remove any grants from the cloned role that are not needed for a billing admin.
3. Add the View Usage Metrics and Manage Jupyter Workspaces grants to this role.

You can learn more about creating custom roles in our article on [Managing Custom Roles](http://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360043438973?language=en_US).

After you create the role, follow these steps to view your usage:

1. In the navigation header, go to **More**> **Admin**.\*\*\*\*
2. On the **Admin** screen in the **Company settings** menu, select **Usage**.
3. Go to the **Jupyter Compute** tab.

## FAQs

**Can I install Plugins?**

Plugins are not currently supported.

**Can I trial the feature?**

Please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Executive (AE) for the most up-to-date information on the trial experience of Jupyter.

**Does Domo offer data science services?**

Yes, we have a team of experienced data scientists ready to help as needed. Please contact your Account Executive (AE) for more information.

**How do I change the kernel?**

First, you must stop the workspace. You may then change the kernel in the Domo workspace edit view.

**Can I reset the kernel?**

Yes. When you hover over a workspace, the ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-06_at_2.52.30_PM.png](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000125tb&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000005vXkS) **Manage Workspaces** menu displays. Choose **Restore Kernel Defaults** from the options. All instances must be stopped to fulfill this action.

**I'm experiencing issues integrating third-party libraries.**

Domo's Jupyter integration allows users to install third-party libraries. However, Domo will not natively support every third-party library. Some third-party libraries may require more effort on the user's end to install, configure, and troubleshoot.
