### The Data Warehouse


TheData Warehouse provides a visually engaging way foryou to interact withyour data warehouse that has been built within Domo. The Data Warehousegives youquick insight into the breadth of your data and also allowsyou to drive into the depth of individual data providers. You can thentakeyour newly gained insights and take effective action on a specific data source or create new data source where a gap was discovered.


TheData Warehouseprovides a three-dimensional visual representation of all data sources and Magic connectors in your Domo, along with data currently flowing into and between them.These are represented as stacks on a rotating palette.You can configure the order and height of the stacks to indicate different metrics.


###### Data Warehouse main view


!


Mousing over a stack causes the palette tostop rotating, and an information panel appears for the data source or Magic connector. This panel shows information such as the number of DataSets for the data source or connector, the number of cards built, the number of successful and failed runs, etc.


You can click and drag the panel tomove it manually. The panel can bemoved in three dimensions.


Stacks are colored differently depending on their type and current activity. Green indicates a functional data source, blue indicates a Magic connector,orange indicates a warning state for a data source, and red indicates that one or more DataSetsfor a data sourceis broken and needs immediate attention.


The arrangement of stacks around the palette and the height of the individual stacksindicatespecified metrics. By default, stack arrangement indicates status and stack height indicates the number of rows of data. If you want, you can change the criteria determined by arrangement and height.For example, you could set the arrangementof stacks around the palette to indicate the number of cards built using thedatasource or Magic connectorand the height of the stacks to indicate the number of DataSets.


Clicking a connector stackchanges the view to show three-dimensional representations of all DataSets for the connector. This view also shows the data sources, the number of DataSets, and the number of rows for the data source or connector.

DETAILED ANSWER: '

============

 RESPONSE:

No, dataset views are not supported in MySQL dataflows. The Data Warehouse feature in Domo provides a visually engaging way to interact with data warehouses built within Domo, and it includes a three-dimensional visual representation of all data sources and Magic connectors in your Domo, along with data currently flowing into and between them. However, this feature does not support dataset views. Workbench 4 includes numerous security and performance upgrades, including the use of API tokens for all Workbench users and implementation of multi-part uploading for all large DataSet Jobs. It also includes a new developer plugin model that will enable you to install new plugins directly in Workbench and create data provider, transport, and transform plugins that can be consumed in a common format (DLL). Buzz v3 provides more enjoyable and meaningful social experiences with colleagues in Domo, but it does not support dataset views either. Notifications Management provides a way for users to know when important things happen in Domo that demand their attention, but it does not support dataset views. The Alert Summary card contains all of the information and options necessary for understanding, editing, and deleting alerts, but it does not support dataset views either. Finally, Domo University training videos access provides access to hundreds of training videos without requiring a separate login, but it does not support dataset views.
