DETAILED ANSWER: '

============

 RESPONSE:

No, dataset views are not supported in MySQL dataflows. The passage explains how to configure a Writeback Connector in Integration Studio, which is enabled after purchasing a Writeback Connector. The steps involve dragging the Input DataSet tile onto the Magic ETL Canvas, configuring each step of the Connector Wizard, adding more tiles to cleanse and manipulate the data, dragging the Writeback tile onto the Canvas, setting up the Connector configuration, and choosing either On dataset update or a schedule to run at specified times. However, there is no mention of dataset views being supported in MySQL dataflows.
