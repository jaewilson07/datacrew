You can use the Customer Support Portal to manage your customer support tickets. You can create new cases, update existing ones, and if you are an Admin, manage the support tickets for your organization. Access the Customer Support Portal by navigating to [support.domo.com](http://support.domo.com) and logging in with your Domo account credentials. The Customer Support Portal is available for all users with Professional or Enterprise versions of Domo.


To learn how to create lists of cases based on different criteria in the Support Portal, see [Creating a New List in the Customer Portal](/s/article/360043427533 "Creating a New List in the Customer Portal").
