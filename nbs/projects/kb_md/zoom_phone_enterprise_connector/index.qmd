Intro
-----


Zoom is one of the leaders in modern enterprise video communications, with an easy and reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing, chat, and webinars. Zoom Phone calling features have been designed to give you a flexible, mobile, and powerful cloud phone system. The Zoom Enterprise Cloud Phone System offers enterprise-class features with a modern user experience to streamline voice communications. It tenders capabilities such as intelligent call routing and auto attendants, out-of-the-box integrations, secure HD voice, interoperability with Standards-based Endpoints, and much more. Use Domo's Zoom Phone Enterprise connector to retrieve your Zoom Phone Enterprise data. To learn more about the Zoom API, visit their [API Documentation](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api "https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api").


You connect to your Zoom account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Zoom Phone Enterprise connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites

Connecting to Your Zoom Account
-------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the ********Credentials******** and ********Details******** panes in the Zoom Phone Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, ********Scheduling********and ********Name & Describe Your DataSet,******** are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


In this pane, you need to enter your Client ID and Client Secret associated with your OAuth App that you created at [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us "https://marketplace.zoom.us"), and select your Zoom account type.




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter the client ID associated with your OAuth App created at [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us "https://marketplace.zoom.us"). For more details, see [Creating an OAuth App](#h_01ES6Q7RQ75R7DT59TND1MNCJC "Zoom Phone Enterprise Connector"). |
| Client Secret | Enter the client secret associated with your OAuth App created at [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us "https://marketplace.zoom.us"). For more details, see [Creating an OAuth App](#h_01ES6Q7RQ75R7DT59TND1MNCJC "Zoom Phone Enterprise Connector"). |
| Account Type | Select the Account Type as Business and higher if your plan is Business, Education, VIP, API Partner, or Enterprise;  otherwise select Pro. |


The Domo Zoom Phone Enterprise connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter your Zoom credentials within Domo. Click ********Connect******** (or select ********Add Account******** if you have existing Zoom accounts in Domo) to open the Zoom OAuth screen where you can enter your Zoom email and password.




 


**Note:** If you are already logged into Zoom when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click **Connect** (after entering the client ID and client secret.) If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of your Zoom account.



Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Zoom Phone Enterprise DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the ********Accounts******** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
