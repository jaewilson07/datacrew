Intro
-----


Use the Domo Google Sheets Add-on to download Datasets from Domo to Google Sheets. You can then edit the data just as you could with any spreadsheet in Google. This is an excellent way to share your Domo data with others in your company who may not have access to Domo.


### What you can do with the Add-on


Using this add-on, you can do all of the following:


* Connect to the server for the desired Domo instance.
* Download any DataSet from your connected instance as a Google Sheet.
* Edit the data in your downloaded DataSet.
* Refresh the DataSet—if anything has changed in this DataSet, you can refresh to the current version in Domo.


### Downloading the Add-on


You can download the add-on from within Google Sheets


**To download the Google Sheets Add-on,**
