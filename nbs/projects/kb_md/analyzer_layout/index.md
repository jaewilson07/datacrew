Intro
-----


In the Analyzer view for a Visualization card (sometimes called the "Card Builder" or "Edit" view), you customize the appearance of your charts and apply DataSet columns to a chart. You can also apply and edit filters, chart properties, sorts, chart name and description, as well as view and manipulate the data table for the chart.


The Analyzer appears as part of the workflow for creating a Visualization card. For more information, see [Visualization Card Building Part 1: Powering Your Card](/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapBGAS "KPI Card Building Part 1: Powering Your Card"). 


Analyzer is only accessible by users with "Admin," "Privileged," or "Editor" default security roles OR a custom security role with the "Edit Cards" privilege enabled. For more information about default security roles, see [Managing Roles](/s/article/360043438973 "Security Role Reference").


For a high-level overview of the Analyzer, see [Analyzer Overview](/s/article/360043428673 "Analyzer Overview").

You can learn more about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data pane | Provides access to data configuration options for the chart, including the following:* **DataSet picker**. Lets you change the DataSet powering this chart.
* **Column filter**. Lets you quickly locate specific columns (dimensions and measures) in the DataSet to use in this chart. If you have created calculated columns for this chart using Beast Mode, you can use the filter to find those columns also.
* **Available columns**. Shows the columns from this DataSet that you can apply to your chart. These are divided into **Measures** (columns that contain items with a "value" data type) and **Dimensions** (columns that contain items with "string," "date," and "date-time" data types). If you have created calculated columns for this chart using Beast Mode, those columns appear here. You apply columns to your chart by dragging and dropping them from this area into the column fields above the chart preview area.
If the column names are too long to fit, you can expand the pane by clicking and dragging on the border of the right side of the pane.
For more information about data types, see [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](/s/article/360043428713 "Understanding Chart Data").
 |
| Name & Description fields | Lets you change the name/description of the Visualization card that contains this chart (the name of the powering DataSet is used by default). This is the name and description that appears at the top of the Visualization card in the page(s). For more information about naming a Visualization card, see [Editing the Name or Description of a Visualization Card](/s/article/360042924174 "Editing the Name or Description of a KPI Card").  |

 |
| Column fields | Provide the means for applying DataSet columns to your chart. To apply columns, you drag them from the available columns region on the left side of the Analyzer into the appropriate fields in this area. These fields differ between chart types. For example, for a standard vertical Bar chart, **X Axis** and **Y Axis** fields would appear. You would drag a value column into the **Y Axis** field and a category column into the **X Axis** field. Your chart preview would then update to show how the chart would look with these columns applied. For more information, see [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](/s/article/360043428713 "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart"). |
| Show/Hide Toolbar | Allows you to show or hide the Toolbar menu. |
| Undo/redo buttons | Allow you to undo a previous sequence of actions or redo actions you have undone. All actions in Analyzer are available for Undo and Redo, including applying Filters and Chart Properties, making date changes, changing chart types, etc. Keyboard shortcuts for Undo and Redo on Mac and Windows are also available (Command + Z/Command + Shift +Z , respectively, on Mac, and Ctrl + Z/Ctrl + Y on Windows).    |
| Summary number | Summarizes the data in the chart. Click the dropdown arrow to open an options menu for configuring the summary number. For more information, see [Configuring Your Chart Summary Number](/s/article/360043428753 "Configuring Your Chart Summary Number"). |
