You can specify the page users initially see in Domo. You do this in the Admin Settings. You can only edit this setting if you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Company Settings" enabled. For more information about default security roles, see [Managing Custom Roles](/s/article/360043438973 "Security Role Reference").


By default, users initially see the Overview page. You can set another page as the landing page that users see. You can specify any Page as the landing page, including a "private" Page. If a user does not have access to the specified landing page, Domo displays the Overview Page.




 


**Notes:**
* The Page tab order does *not* change when setting a Page as the default landing page. You can re-order or lock the order of Pages. For information about ordering Pages, see [Adding Company Pages](/s/article/360042934414 "Managing Pages").
* The Overview Page cannot be re-ordered, locked, or hidden.






**To set the landing page,**


1. Click **More** **> Admin**.  
The Admin Settings appears.
2. Click **Company settings > Company page settings**.
3. Under **Default Landing Page**, select the Page you want from the menu.
4. In the Page specified as the landing page, verify that the Page is appropriately shared with others. For more information, see [Sharing and Access to Cards and Pages](/s/article/360042932994 "Sharing Access to Content").
