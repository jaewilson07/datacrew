Intro
-----


Domo’s Magic ETL is now more performant, more feature-rich, and more consistent. Magic ETL v2 is broadly compatible with Magic ETL v1; most existing transforms can be upgraded frictionlessly. You must upgrade Magic ETL for each DataFlow. You can find detailed instructions for that process below.







**Important:** There are significant behavioral changes in Magic ETL which may affect your DataFlows. Learn about them in [Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL](/s/article/360047787514) before upgrading.



Upgrading Magic ETL
-------------------


Follow these steps for each DataFlow you want to upgrade:


1. Go to the DataFlow you want to upgrade.


2. In the top right corner of the DataFlow edit area, select the **Try the new Magic ETL** toggle.

**Important:** After you upgrade a DataFlow, the toggle will no longer be available and you cannot revert to Magic ETL v1.



This video demonstrates how to upgrade a DataFlow around the 4-minute mark.
