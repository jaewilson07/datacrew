Intro
-----


You can remove a single Card from a Page using the **Remove** option for the Card. You can also remove multiple Cards from any number of Pages in **More >****Admin > Cards**. 


**Video - Removing and Deleting Cards in Domo**



 


Removing a single Card from a Page
----------------------------------


When you remove a Card from a Page, only that instance of the Card is removed. The Card may appear on other Pages and is still available in Domo to be added to Pages.




 


**Note:**You can permanently delete a Card from Domo so the Card no longer exists and cannot be re-added. For more information, see [Deleting Cards from Domo](/s/article/360043428593 "Deleting a Card from Domo").



You can also remove a Card from a Page by moving it to another Page. For more information about moving a Card to another Page, see [Moving or Copying Cards to Other Pages](/s/article/360042923254 "Moving or Copying Cards to Other Pages").




 


**Note:**If a Page has been locked, you can only remove Cards if you are the Page owner or you have an "Admin" security role. For more information about locking and unlocking content on Pages, see [Default Security Role Reference](/s/article/360043438953 "Locking or Unlocking Page Content").



**To remove a Card,**


1. On a Page, mouse over the Card you want to remove.
2. Click ![Screen_Shot_2020-04-10_at_2.51.50_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2020-04-10_at_2.51.50_PM.png), then select **Remove**.  
A dialog appears.
3. Click **Remove**.




 


**Notes:**


* You  can also remove a Card from a Page using the **Delete** option in the Card Details view. This option removes all copies of the Card from Domo. It does *not* remove duplicate versions. For more information about copying and duplicating Cards, see [Card Details View Layout](/s/article/360042923934 "Moving or Copying Cards to Other Pages").
* A user with an "Admin" security role can delete Cards from Pages in **Admin Settings > Pages** by selecting the Cards and then clicking **Delete Cards** in the **Edit** menu. For more information about security roles, see [Default Security Role Reference](/s/article/360043438953).






Removing multiple Cards at once
-------------------------------


You can remove multiple Cards from any Pages where those Cards appear by using the **Remove from Pages** option in **Admin Settings > Content > Cards**. You must have an "Admin" security role or a custom role with "Manage All Cards and Pages" enabled to do this. For more information about default security roles, see [Managing Custom Roles](/s/article/360043438973 "Security Role Reference").




 


**Note:**You can permanently delete a Card from Domo so the Card no longer exists and cannot be re-added. For more information, see [Deleting Cards from Domo](/s/article/360043428593 "Deleting a Card from Domo").



**To remove multiple Cards from Pages,**


1. Select **More** in the toolbar at the top of the screen, then select**Admin**.
2. Select **Cards**.
3. Check the boxes for all of the Cards you want to remove.
4. Select **Edit > Remove From Pages**.  
A dialog appears in which you can select the Pages these Cards should be removed from.
5. In the **Search Pages** field, enter the name of a Page the selected Cards should be removed from.  
The names of Pages matching the characters you've entered pop up in a list.
6. Click the name of the desired Page to add it to the field.
7. (Optional) To add more Pages to the field, repeat steps 5 and 6 as often as necessary.
8. Click **Remove From Pages**.


The Cards are removed from the Pages you specified.
