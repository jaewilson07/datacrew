Intro
-----


Thank you for your interest in the Scheduler app! This guide will help you familiarize yourself with the features and layout of the app— please refer to the Scheduler Implementation Guide for app set-up and further explanation into the app’s features. The main purpose of the Scheduler app is to allow for a broad variety of scheduling use-cases, as opposed to other offerings in the market which are targeted towards very specific business needs. You can also select which language you would like the app to appear in, the language configuration is done in the admin settings.

How do I get this?
------------------


To begin using the Scheduler app, locate the app in the Appstore or have an Admin contact your Customer Success Manager.


Scheduler
---------


The Scheduler portion of the app, which is set-up and configured in the Admin settings, is where end-users will go to schedule initial and follow-up appointments. The flow/ordering of sections, questionnaire, and availability, are a few of the options that appear throughout the Scheduler that are implemented on the Admin side and are not hard-coded.


### Splash Screen


The first thing that you will see in the app is the app splash screen, which can be customized in the Admin settings. End-users will only be able to see the **Schedule Now** button and **Schedule Follow-Up** button—if follow-up appointments have been enabled in the app—and will not be able to see the **Admin** button.  
  



![Splash_screen.png](Splash_screen.png)


### Schedule Now - Information


The first step of the Scheduler is the **Information** section—note that the title can be changed by admins in Admin settings. The questions in the Information section are hard-coded and cannot be changed by admins. The questions include:


1. First Name: free-text field
2. Last Name: free-text field
3. Date of Birth: validated MM/DD/YYYY format
4. Address: free-text field
5. City: free-text field
6. State: dropdown with pre-populated options
7. Zip Code: validated numeric field (5-to-9-digit format)
8. Phone Number: validated numeric field (\_\_\_) \_\_\_-\_\_\_\_
9. Email Address: validated free-text field
10. Validate Email Address: validated free-text field (validated against the end-users answer to the Email Address question)


All of the questions are required in this section, and if any fields are left blank end-users will not be able to move on to the next section.


Users can move to the next section by selecting the **Next Step** button from the bottom-right corner of the screen. The **Cancel** button will take users back to the splash screen.

### Schedule Now - Location


A list of locations—configured in the Admin settings—will be available to end-users in this section. Users can only select one option from the list, or they can select the **Any** option if it has been enabled by Admins. The selected location will determine the date and time range available for scheduling.


Users can move to the next section by selecting the **Next Step** button from the bottom-right corner of the screen or move to the previous section by selecting the **Previous Step** button. The **Cancel** button will take users back to the splash screen.  
  



![location.png](location.png)  
  



### Schedule Now - Resource


A list of resources—configured in the Admin settings—will be available to end-users in this section. Available resources will be dependent upon the location that was selected. Users can only select one option from the list, or they can select the **Any** option if it has been enabled by Admins.  
  



![resource.png](resource.png)  
  



### Schedule Now - Service


A list of services—configured in the Admin settings—will be available to end-users in this section. Available services will be dependent upon the location and resource that were selected. Users can only select one option from the list, or they can select the **Any** option if it has been enabled by Admins.  
  



![service.png](service.png)  
  



### Schedule Now - Date & Time


The date and time of an appointment can be selected on this screen. Resources can also be changed on this screen if users want to use a different resource for their appointment. Available appointments will be indicated on the calendar and once a date has been selected the available appointment times will show on to the right of the calendar. Only one appointment can be scheduled at a time. If there are no available time periods for the selected day then the time option will not appear.

### Schedule Now - Questionnaire


The questionnaire section may or may not be available in the Scheduler, depending on if the Admin included it in the configuration portion of the app. The questionnaire may be different for every version of the Scheduler depending on the connected Form Builder DataSet.  
  



![questionnaire.png](questionnaire.png)  
  



### Schedule Now - Summary


The Summary screen shows an overview of all of the submitted answers in each section in order (i.e., Information, Resource, Location, Date & Time, etc.). In order to book their appointment, users will need to select the **Submit** from the bottom-right corner of the screen. The Summary screen also includes a reCAPTCHA checkbox that will need to be checked before submitting their appointment information.  
  



![summary.png](summary.png)  
  



### Schedule Now - Confirmation


The Confirmation screen will show the users’ appointment information and display the QR code that the user may need in order to get into their appointment. Users can book another appointment (start over) by selecting the **Book Again** button from the bottom of the screen.  
  



![confirmation.png](confirmation.png)  
  



### Schedule Follow Up - Customer ID


The only difference with the follow-up scheduling flow is the **Customer ID** step. This step prompts users to enter the customer ID they have been provided—this ensures that they are scheduling the correct service based upon their initial appointment.

Admin
-----


The Admin portion of the app allows users with admin-level roles to see a list view of all appointments and configure the app settings. The Admin screen can be accessed either by selecting the **Admin** button from the splash screen or selecting the gear icon in the Scheduler portion of the app.


### List View


Admin users are able to see a list view of all currently scheduled appointments. Admins can view today’s appointments, this week’s, this month’s, and past appointments. Admins are also able to filter by location, service, and resource as well as search by first and last name, email, and phone number to find specific appointments. The **New Item** button will take admin users through the Scheduler flow, where they can schedule appointments for users.

### Admin Settings - Set up Workflow


Admins can set up the workflow order for the Scheduler portion of the app in the **Set Up Workflow** tab. The workflow options include Location, Resource, Service, and Questionnaire. Each of these steps can be hidden by selecting the checkbox next to each step. Steps can be moved around in order by selecting the dot menu next to each step. The **Show Any** button will allow users to see an **Any** option when they are selecting a location, service, or resource. The **Invitations required for appointment scheduling** configures the Scheduler app to only accept appointments if the user has an invite code.
