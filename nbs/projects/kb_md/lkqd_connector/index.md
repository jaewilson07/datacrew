Intro
-----


LKQD is a feature-rich single tag solution capable of delivering Flash and HTML5 video ads.  To learn more about the LKQD API, visit their page (<https://wiki.lkqd.com/display/API/LKQD+API;jsessionid=5ADD8B5B83CE27031FAB837DAEAF0E49>).


You connect to your LKQD account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the LKQD connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your LKQD account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:


* An LKQD secret key ID
* An LKQD secret key


If you need help obtaining these credentials, please reach out to your LKQD account representative. 


Connecting to Your LKQD Account
-------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the LKQD Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your LKQD account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LKQD Secret Key ID | Enter your LKQD secret key ID. |
| LKQD Secret Key | Enter your LKQD secret key. |


Once you have entered valid LKQD credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new LKQD DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains various menus in which you can configure your LKQD report.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Time Dimension | Select how you want the data in your report to be aggregated. |
| Start Hour | Select the desired start hour for the report.  |
| End Hour | Select the desired end hour for the report. |
| Report Type | Select up to three report type dimensions for the report. |
| Duration  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.  |
| Report Date  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.  |
| Select Specific Date  | Select the date for the report.  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.   |
| Start Date | Specify whether the first date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the last date in your range in **End Date**.  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in **Start Date**.   |
| Select Specific Start Date | Select the first date in your date range.  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with **Days Back to End At** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for **Days Back to Start From** and 5 for **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with **Days Back to Start From** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for **Days Back to Start From** and 5 for **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |


### Other Panes
