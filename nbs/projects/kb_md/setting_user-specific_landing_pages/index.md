Intro
-----


With User-Specific Landing Pages, Admins can set curated Landing Pages to specify which content appears for specific users upon login. Users also have the ability to specify their own personal Landing Page. Either a Dashboard or a specific Card can be set as the Landing Page. This allows for setting Landing Pages that are relevant to their department, their team, or just that particular user.







**Note:** Currently, the most recent option that has been set for a user will be the Landing Page that is displayed. For example, if an Admin has set a Landing Page for a specific user and then that user changes their Landing Page to a different one, the user's selection will override the Admin's selection.
