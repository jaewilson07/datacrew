The Asset Manager app allows you to manage and configure your ad campaign images in one convenient location. You can add, delete, and include descriptions and tags for each managed image. Like the Asset Viewer app, you can take a step forward and configure the app’s viewing settings to fit your business use case. Images can also be filtered according to description type or associated tags & they can also be searched for using the search bar option in the tool bar menu. All images placed in the Asset Manager app are placed into App DB and have their own associated dataset in Domo for you to access for other use cases.

### Add Image


The Add Image button is where you're able to add new images to your Image Manager app. Upload a new file either by dragging and dropping it into the field or searching for and selecting one from your machine. Include a description and tags to make your images easy to search for and identify.

The Configuration button is where you'll go to configure your viewing setting in the app. Here you can configure your default view to one of the three viewing options: Single Item, Grid, or List. You're also able to configure the content types that will be added to each image such as the name as description or tag OR type as text, decimal, or number.
