Intro
-----


Yelp is a local business directory service and review site with social networking features. To learn more about the Yelp Reporting API, visit their page (<https://www.yelp.com/developers>).


You connect to your Yelp Reporting account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Yelp Reporting connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Yelp account and create a dataset, you must have your Yelp Reporting API username and password. This username and password is different from your standard Yelp login. To request your credentials, please reach out to your Yelp sales representative. Your Yelp sales representative will create the credentials and share them with you. 


Connecting to Your Yelp Reporting Account
-----------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Yelp Reporting Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Yelp account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter your Yelp username. |
| Password | Enter your Yelp password. |


Once you have entered valid Yelp credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Yelp Reporting DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
