Intro
-----


Fluxx is a network that powers giving in the world by connecting givers and change makers. To learn more about Fluxx, visit their page (<https://www.fluxx.io/resource-center>).


You connect to your Fluxx account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Fluxx connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Fluxx account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:


* The URL of your Fluxx instance
* Your Fluxx client ID
* Your Fluxx client secret


To obtain your credentials, reach out to your Fluxx account representative. 


Connecting to Your Fluxx Account
--------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Fluxx Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").

Once you have entered valid Fluxx credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Fluxx DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
