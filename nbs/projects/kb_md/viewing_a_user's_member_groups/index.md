You can see what groups a user belongs to in the Groups pane in his or her Profile page. For more information about groups, see [Creating and Managing User Groups](/s/article/360043438913 "Managing Users and Groups").


**To see what groups a user belongs to,**


1. Open the user's Profile page by clicking his or her profile picture anywhere that it appears and clicking **Go to Profile** in the avatar card.
2. Click the **Groups** hyperlink.  
 The Groups pane appears on screen. This pane contains the names of all the groups this user belongs to. You can mouse over any group to pop up a list of all members of that group.
