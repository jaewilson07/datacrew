Intro
-----


You can be notified when certain events occur in Domo. You can receive Notifications via email or text. These event occurrences include the following:


* A Buzz message is posted to a conversation you are a member of.  
For more information, see [Chatting in Buzz](/s/article/360042925574 "Chatting in Buzz").
* You are mentioned in a Buzz discussion using @ (in which case you become a part of the discussion and continue receiving Notifications for comments in that discussion unless you unfollow the discussion).
* An Alert you have created is triggered. For more information, see [Creating a Custom Alert for a Visualization Card](/s/article/360043430513 "Creating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card").
* A Domo Daily Alert Summary message is sent to you.
* An issue is reported in a card that you own or that you are following. For more information, see [Reporting Issues with Cards](/s/article/360042923834 "Reporting Issues with Cards").
* Someone "likes" a discussion you started or a comment you made in Buzz.


In addition, you can view all of your Notifications by clicking your user profile photo in the top right corner of the screen.
