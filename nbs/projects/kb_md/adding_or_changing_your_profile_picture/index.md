In the Profile page, you can add or change your profile picture. You can upload as many profile pictures to Domo as you want. Domo stores all of your profile pictures, and you can choose a new stored picture (or upload a new picture to your store of pictures) whenever you want. When you select a picture for uploading, Domo gives you options to crop and rotate it before you upload it. You can also delete any profile picture you've uploaded.




 


**Note:**


* Profile pictures are different from *personal photos*, which are photos you upload to Domo that appear only in your Profile page. These photos do not represent you throughout Domo like a profile picture does. Profile pictures are also different from *background images*, which appear in the background of your Profile page. For more information about personal photos, see [Changing Your Profile Background Image](/s/article/360043439433 "Managing Your Personal Photos").
* You can only change someone else's profile picture if you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Edit Users" enabled. For more information about default security roles, see [Managing Custom Roles](/s/article/360043438973 "Security Role Reference").
