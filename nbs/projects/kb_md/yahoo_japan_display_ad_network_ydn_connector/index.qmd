Intro
-----


Yahoo! JAPAN Corporation is a Japanese internet company originally formed as a joint venture between the American internet company Yahoo! (now Altaba) and the Japanese company SoftBank. Use Domo's Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector to pull data from your Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) system into Domo. To learn more about the Yahoo! JAPAN Marketing Solutions API, visit their page ([https://biz.marketing.yahoo.co.jp/developercenter-en/program/](https://biz.marketing.yahoo.co.jp/developercenter-en/program/ "https://biz.marketing.yahoo.co.jp/developercenter-en/program/")).


You connect to your Yahoo! JAPAN account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Yahoo! JAPAN account and create a DataSet, you must have your Yahoo! JAPAN Business ID and password associated with your Yahoo! JAPAN account.


Connecting to Your Yahoo! JAPAN Account
---------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the ****Credentials**** and ****Details**** panes in the Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, ****Scheduling**** and ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


The Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click **Connect** (or select **Add Account** if you have existing Yahoo! JAPAN accounts in Domo) to open the Yahoo! JAPAN OAuth screen where you can enter your Yahoo! JAPAN credentials. Once you have entered valid Yahoo! JAPAN credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").




 


**Note:** If you are already logged into Yahoo! JAPAN when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click **Add account**. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the Yahoo! JAPAN account that you are logged in.



#### Establishing a new connection:


1. To connect to your Yahoo! JAPAN account through the Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector, click the **Connect** button in the connector UI.

2. A Yahoo! JAPAN login window will appear where you need to enter your **Yahoo! JAPAN Business ID** and **Password**.

| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with ****Days Back to Start From**** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for ****Days Back to Start From**** and 5 for ****Days Back to End At****, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |
