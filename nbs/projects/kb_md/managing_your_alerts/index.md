Intro
-----


You can manage all Alerts in the Alert Center. You can also choose to follow suggested Alerts created by other users. You can also manage your individual *Card*Alerts in the Card Details view, and your individual *DataSet* Alerts in the Data Center. From any of these locations, you can open a panel that provides options for setting Notifications, making edits, viewing the owner and followers, and seeing the Alert history.

Subscribing or unsubscribing to an Alert
----------------------------------------


When you subscribe to an Alert on a Card or a DataSet, you receive Notifications whenever that Alert is triggered, edited, or deleted.


When you click the **Subscribe** button for an Alert, icons appear for four methods of receiving Notifications—SMS ![alert_sms_icon.png](alert_sms_icon.png), email ![alert_email_icon.png](alert_email_icon.png), mobile push notifications ![alert_push_icon.png](alert_push_icon.png), and telephone call ![alert_phone_icon.png](alert_phone_icon.png). Of these, all but the telephone option are active by default. You can turn an option on or off by clicking on its icon. If you turn off all four Notification options, you become unsubscribed from the Alert. When you unsubscribe to an Alert, you no longer receive Notifications when any changes occur for that Alert.   


You can also choose to receive a daily or weekly email listing all Alerts that triggered in the last day or week, respectively. You do this by clicking the ![alert_calendar_icon.png](alert_calendar_icon.png) icon then checking the box for **Daily** or **Weekly**. 


To see all your subscribed Alerts, open the Alert Center then click **Subscribed** in the **Quick Filters** pane on the left side of the Alert Center. 


**To subscribe or unsubscribe to an Alert in the Alert Center,**

2. Locate the Alert you want to subscribe or unsubscribe to.
3. (Conditional) Do one of the following:


	* To subscribe, click the **Subscribe** button, then choose the desired Notification options by toggling their icons on or off.   
	   
	 You can also choose to add the Alerts to your daily and weekly summaries by clicking ![alert_calendar_icon.png](alert_calendar_icon.png) then clicking in the appropriate checkboxes.
	* To unsubscribe, click each highlighted Notification icon to turn it off.
