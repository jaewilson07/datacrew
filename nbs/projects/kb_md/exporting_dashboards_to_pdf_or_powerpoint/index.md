Intro
-----


You can export Dashboards to a PDF by selecting the **Export as PDF** option or to PowerPoint by selecting the **Export as PowerPoint** option in the share menu in the upper right corner of the screen. This option appears *only* for Dashboard Pages. It does not appear for standard pages.




 

**Note:** Exporting card descriptions is not supported. If a card description is enabled on a dashboard, that description does not show when the dashboard is exported.



**To export a Dashboard to PDF,**


1. Open the Dashboard you want to export.
2. In the ![page_share_options_menu.png](page_share_options_menu.png) menu in the upper right corner, select **Export as PDF**.

**To export a Dashboard to PowerPoint,**


1. Open the Dashboard you want to export.
2. In the ![page_share_options_menu.png](page_share_options_menu.png) menu in the upper right corner, select **Export as PowerPoint**.

Export icon grayed out
----------------------


If any layout (section of Cards) on the Page is greater than 11 inches high, the **Export as PDF**option is unavailable (since a PDF page is 11 inches high). The same is true for the **Export to PowerPoint** option. If you go into the Edit mode for the Page, a warning message appears as a banner at the top of the page as follows:

A warning message also appears next to the Card that is too tall, as follows:

Once you shorten all layouts displaying this warning, you will be able to export the page to PDF.

View page breaks
----------------


To easily see if your Dashboard will export to PDF or PowerPoint, you can enable the **Page breaks** toggle. This displays the maximum height that a layout section can be before it gets cut off.
