Intro
-----


When editing a dashboard on the web, you can customize the mobile version to create targeted and curated experiences for anybody on a mobile phone. In the **Editing Dashboard** view, you can 


* Edit the mobile layout from the web, including dragging and dropping cards to swap locations, adjusting borders, and changing card sizes.
* Hide cards specifically for mobile.
* Set dashboard interactions for mobile.







**Note:** To edit a dashboard's mobile view, you must be the dashboard owner, an admin, or have permission to edit the dashboard.

3. From the **Desktop** menu, select **Mobile**.

Interactive Dashboards on Mobile
--------------------------------


Easily interact with charts as well as apply Filters with a single tap. Filters can also now be cleared with a single tap. The “Drill in place” option is now available on Mobile. With Interactive Dashboards on mobile, you now have more actions available from the Page level, and you never lose context of the surrounding content. This allows users to experience the same interactivity they have on Web, now on their Mobile device.


 


FAQ's
-----


**I’m noticing some slight differences between how the cards appear in the mobile preview on the web vs. mobile.**


The mobile preview on the web will serve as a very close approximation of what the cards actually look like on mobile. However, due to the different sizing of different mobile devices, there might be very slight differences in the amount of visible content. This is expected.


**Why can’t I drag cards in the mobile editor from the appendix?**


In order for a card to be rearranged in the mobile layout, it must not be in the appendix.


**Can I place a card in the layout on the web version but in the appendix section on mobile?**


No, the card must be in a layout in order to be customized in the mobile layout.


**How do I get into the card details view on a mobile device?**


Just like on the web, tapping on the card's title will take you into the Card Details view.
