**Important:** Support for Workbench 4 ended on **April 15, 2021**. Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click [**here**](/s/article/360043437333).



You can configure Workbench to allow users to be notified via email when a DataSet job is completed, either successfully or unsuccessfully. You do this in the **Notifications** pane for a given DataSet job. This lists all of the users on your Domo server with their roles and the email addresses to which notifications will be sent. For each user, **Notify on Success** and **Notify on Error** boxes are available. For any given user, you can select one box, both boxes, or leave both blank (in which case no notifications are sent).

**To set notifications for a Workbench job,**


1. In the **Accounts** pane, navigate to the DataSet job you want to set notifications on, then select **Notifications** under that job.
2. Locate the user in the list you want to set notifications for.
3. Check the desired box(es).
4. Click "X" to close the dialog.
