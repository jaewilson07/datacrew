New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


Card enhancements
-----------------


Polish your charts for great-looking Stories.


### Table Card


#### Padding


Give your tables a new clean look by adding custom padding to your tables. Now you control the look of your tables more than ever before. For more information, see [Table Chart](/s/article/360043429573 "Table Chart").

#### Paging


Handle larger tables than ever before with dynamic paging of rows of data in your Mega Table Cards.


#### Copy


Copy has been added to your Mega Tables for easy movement of data by using copy and paste.


### Multi-Value Gauge


Now you have more customizable options to enhance the look of the text on your chart. Choose between new Bold and Italics options. For more information, see [Multi-Value Gauge](/s/article/360042924774 "Multi-Value Gauge").

### Map Card


New options to make your maps pop including: border options, min and max value scales, and allow three bigger sizes on bubbles in your Lat/Long maps to really make a compelling data story. Emphasize the bigger numbers in a bold new way. For more information, see [Latitude-Longitude Map](/s/article/360043429213 "Latitude-Longitude Map").

### Card data point limit increase


Now you have the power to render very large amounts of data in your charts. You can now use the **Limit Rows** command inside of the Analyzer to set values larger than would otherwise be possible. To keep the responsiveness fast on your Dashboards, the chart engine limits the number of rows it downloads to the browser. Now you can override these limits by explicitly setting these values. For more information, see [Card Building FAQs](/s/article/360042924214 "Card Building FAQs").

### Control messages


Control the messages your users see in charts when the "No data in filtered range" message is called for. Set your own personalized message instead.
