In addition to allowing you to power up pre-installed best practice dashboards as described in Powering Up Business-in-a-Box Dashboards, Business-in-a-Box also lets you do the following:


* Link card pages from your Domo instance to a given department tab.
* Add apps from the Appstore.


When you add card pages or Appstore dashboards to a department tab, they appear in the list of dashboards for that tab, providing quick and easy navigation for users with a given role. For example, Domo user Judy is over YouTube marketing campaigns for her company. In addition to the pre-installed Business-in-a-Box dashboards available in the Business-in-a-Box "Marketing" tab, she also regularly refers to another card page in Domo called "YouTube Marketing." Instead of having to constantly switch between Business-in-a-Box and the "YouTube Marketing" page, Judy can simplify her navigation by linking "YouTube Marketing" to the "Marketing" tab in Business in a Box. She can then access all her marketing dashboards from one place. 


You can *only* add card pages or Appstore dashboards to Business-in-a-Box if you have an "Admin" security role or a custom role with "Manage All Cards and Pages" enabled.


**To link to one or more card pages from Business-in-a-Box,**


1. Select **Dashboards** in the toolbar at the top of the screen.
2. Select **Business-in-a-Box** in your left-hand navigation pane.

3. Select the tab for the department in which you want to add a link to a card page.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the department tab to find the **Add Dashboard** option.  
This option only appears if you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Cards and Pages" enabled.
5. Click **Add Dashboard**.
6. Click **Reference Existing**.
7. Check the boxes for all card pages you want to add to Business-in-a-Box.

All of the pages you selected are added to the department tab.

The Appstore opens, with the department tab name entered into the "Filter" field by default.
