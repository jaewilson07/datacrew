Because Rotten Tomatoes has recently disabled all its API keys, this connector is now deprecated and is no longer available in Domo. However, any DataSets or cards built using Rotten Tomatoes data should still work (it just won't update).


For questions, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager, or contact Technical Support.
