Intro
-----


Use the Location Readiness App to view COVID-19 related data for a County or State. By default, the application shows data related to the United States. By searching for a County or State, all of the sections (Summary, Testing, Social Distancing, and Projections) will return data for the specific County or State you’ve selected.




 

**Note:**When data is not available for a County, the Location Readiness App will return data for the County’s State.



* Get a precise view of how COVID-19 is impacting the Counties where your offices are located.
* Make decisions about locations to open up based on new cases, testing, and social distancing metrics.
* Stay informed on any changes with daily email updates on stats for up to three Counties.




 


**Note:** This app is part of the [Get Back to Work Solution](/s/article/360056653654 "Get Back to Work Solution") and is available *on-demand and paid*. 


 


To request this feature be enabled,


* Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Account Executive.
