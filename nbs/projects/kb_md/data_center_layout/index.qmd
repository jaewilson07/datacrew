**Video - Data Center Overview**



 


Data Warehouse tab
==================


The Data Warehouse in Domo provides a three-dimensional visual representation of all DataSets in your Domo, broken down by connector, along with data currently flowing into and between them. DataSets for each connector type are represented as stacks on a rotating palette. You can configure the order and height of the connector stacks to indicate different metrics. For example, you could sort the connector stacks by number of rows but have the height of the individual stacks represent the number of DataSets. For more information about The Data Warehouse, see [Using The Data Warehouse to Manage Data](/s/article/360043430413 "Using The Data Warehouse to Manage Data").


In the Data Warehouse tab you have access to a toolbar that provides shortcuts for [opening the DomoR installation page](/s/article/360042923734 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


DataSets and DataFlows tabs
===========================


The **DataSets**and **DataFlows** tabs list DataSets and DataFlows, respectively, in your Domo instance. In these tabs you can 


* view DataSets and DataFlows that have been added to Domo  
  
For a DataSet, you can view information about the DataSet, including the connector, the name, the owner, the number of rows and columns in the DataSet, the number of cards being powered by the DataSet, the total number of times these cards have been viewed, and the amount of time since the DataSet was last updated. You can also preview or delete a DataSet.  
  
For a DataFlow, you can view information about the DataFlow, including the name, owner, number of input and output DataSets, number of runs vs. success rate, and the amount of time since the DataFlow was last run.  
  
Both tabs include options for searching with or without filters, applying quick filters, saving favorite filters, and sorting the DataSets/DataFlows in the list.
* add DataSets and DataFlows  
  
From either tab you can...


	+ [add data into Domo from third-party systems](/s/article/360042926274 "Connecting to Data with Connectors"), then transform the data to power up multiple cards without having to locate and re-upload that DataSet for each card.
	+ add Magic transforms of any kind—[DataFusions](/s/article/360043428293 "ETL DataFlows").
	+ get information about and download [Workbench](/s/article/360042932554 "Connecting to Data Using Workbench 5").
	+ get information about installing the [DomoR plugin](/s/article/360042923734 "DomoR Plugin").
* visually identify DataSets needing attention  
  
DataSets with errors do *not* run as scheduled until errors are resolved.  Domo lets you know when a DataSet cannot run successfully by displaying the error on the DataSet in the Data Center and in the Accounts page, and by sending the owner of the DataSet an alert that describes the error and links to the DataSet.


The following screenshot points out the most important parts of the **DataFlows** and **DataSets**tabs. (This screenshot is specifically from the **DataFlows** tab, but the only difference between the two tabs is different information in the rows.) 


![data_center_new.png](data_center_new.png)


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Lets you search for the desired DataSet/DataFlow in the list. This search draws from a variety of metadata, including name, connector, owner, tags, status, and more. You can refine your search by doing any of the following:* Clicking a recommended filter. These may appear when you enter a search term or part of search term in the field.data_center_recommended_filters.png
* Adding a custom filter. You do this by clicking **Add Filter**, selecting the desired filter from the list, then entering the filter criteria as required. For example...
	+ If you selected **Owned****By**, you would be prompted to enter the owner of the DataSet or DataFlow you wanted to view.
	+ If you selected **DataFlow Type**, you would be prompted to select the desired DataFlow type from a list.
	+ If you selected **Last Updated**, you would be prompted to specify whether the DataFlow or DataSet was last updated on, before, or after the given date, then select the date itself.
* Changing the sort used in the list. You do this by clicking in the menu in the top right corner of your search results (shown as "Relevance" in the above screenshot) then choosing the desired sort type.For DataSets, you can sort by relevance, name, number of cards, number of rows, last run date, or status (broken DataSets are shown first). For DataFlows, you can sort by relevance, creation date, last modified date, name, status (broken DataFlows are shown first), success rate, or last run date.
 |
| Add Filter | Lets you filter the DataSets or DataFlows in the list. This option is described in more detail in the entry for "Search," above. |
| Favorite Filter icon | Lets you save the current filter configuration. When you click this icon, you are prompted to enter a unique name for the filter. When you save the new filter, the star icon turns gray and the filter appears under **Favorite Filters** in the panel on the left side of the screen. You can then click this filter anytime to apply it. 
You can remove a saved filter by clicking the gray star icon and then choosing **Remove**.
You can also do a "Save As" on a saved filter. This is useful when you make changes to an existing filter and want to keep both filters. To do this, you click on the gray star icon, enter the new filter name in the name field, click **Update**, then select **Save As New Filter**.
These options are also available via the **Favorite Filters** area in the panel on the left side of the screen. If you mouse over a filter here, a gear icon displays. Clicking this icon reveals the following options:* **Rename**. Lets you rename a saved filter.
* **Duplicate**. Lets you do a "Save As" on the filter. When you save the filter in this way, a second version of the filter appears in the list, with the word "copy" appended to it. You can rename it if you want using the **Rename** option described above.
* **Delete**. Removes the filter.
 |
| Sort  | Lets you sort the DataSets or DataFlows in the list. This option is described in more detail in the entry for "Search," above. |
| Quick Filters/Favorite Filters | Lets you quickly apply any prebuilt filters (**Quick Filters**) or saved filters (**Favorite Filters**). 
Available Quick Filters include the following:* **All DataSets/All DataFlows**. Removes all filters from the list. This is a good way to "reset" the list after you have applied many filters.
* **Recently run**. Filters to show only those DataSets/DataFlows that have been run in the last several days.
* **Owned by you**. Filters to show only those DataSets/DataFlows you are the owner of.
* **Needs attention**. Filters to show only those DataSets/DataFlows in a broken state (indicated by a red exclamation point on the DataSet/DataFlow in the list).

Favorite Filters are those filter configurations you have saved. These are described in more detail in the entry for "Favorite Filter icon," above. |
| DataSets/DataFlows | Display information about each DataSet or DataFlow. For DataSets, this information includes the name, connector, owner profile picture, number of rows and columns, number of cards powered by the DataSet, any tags, and the last update time. For DataFlows, the information includes the name, owner, number of input and output DataSets, number of runs versus the success rate, any tags, and the last run time. 
For each DataSet or DataFlow, you can do the following:* Click the photo to open a user avatar card with information, including a list of groups to which the user belongs, card view statistics, and a **Follow** button so you can follow this user in Buzz.
* Click the DataSet or DataFlow name to open the details view for the DataSet or DataFlow, which provides additional options. For example, for a DataSet, you can see a preview of the data, cards being powered by the DataSet, a run history, and so on.
* Mouse over the row to reveal a wrench icon Wrench.png that provides access to various options for interacting with this DataSet or DataFlow. These options are listed in the entry for "Options," beow.
* Add search tags to this DataSet or DataFlow so you can more easily find it later. This is described in more detail in the entry for "Add Tag," below.
* Take bulk actions on DataSets or DataFlows. You can select an initial DataSet or DataFlow to take action on by mousing over the row then clicking the checkbox that appears in the top left corner of that row. This pops up a blue bar along the top of the screen with new options. From here you can do all of the following:
	+ Select more DataSets/DataFlows by mousing over them and checking their checkboxes.
	+ Select all DataSets/DataFlows currently appearing in the list by clicking **Select All** in the blue bar.
	+ Tag selected DataSets/DataFlows by clicking the data_center_bulk_tag_icon.png icon on the right side of the blue bar. For more information about tagging, see the entry for "Add Tag" in this table.
	+ Apply additional actions by clicking the data_center_bulk_gear_icon.png icon on the right side of the blue bar then selecting the desired option:
		- **Run Now**. This executes all of the selected DataSets or DataFlows.
		- **Change Owner.**This allows you to select a new owner for the selected DataSets or DataFlows. For more information, see [Changing the Owner of a DataFlow](/s/article/360042923174 "Changing the Owner of a DataSet").
		- **Delete**. This allows you to delete all of the selected DataSets or DataFlows. To delete DataSets you must have an "Admin" security profile or be the DataSet owner. For more information, see [Disabling or Deleting a DataFlow](/s/article/360043427833).

For a DataFlow, you can also mouse over the "Inputs/Outputs" data to show all of the input and output DataSets for this DataFlow.  |
| Add Tag | Lets you add search tags to this DataSet or DataFlow so you can easily find it later by searching for those tags. When you click **Add tag**, a dialog appears with a list of existing tags. (If no tags have yet been added for your company, this list appears blank.) data_center_tags_dialog.png
You can then do either of the following:* Add *existing*tags to the DataSet or DataFlow by clicking them in the list. Any tags that have already been added appear blue. You can filter the tags in the list by entering the desired tag name in the **Search and add tags** field.
* Add a *new* tag to the DataSet or DataFlow by entering the tag name in the **Search and add tags** field. If the tag does not yet exist, it appears alone in the list area with the "Create new tag" designation. You can then click it to add it to the DataSet or DataFlow.

You can remove a tag from a DataSet or DataFlow by clicking the "x" next to the tag while in this dialog.
You can also access the tagging functionality by doing any of the following:* Selecting **View Tags** in the options menu for a DataSet or DataFlow in the list view.
* Selecting **Tags** in the options menu for a DataSet or DataFlow details view.
* Clicking **Add tag** under the DataSet name in the details view (DataSets only).

You can add tags to multiple DataSets or DataFlows at once by selecting the DataSets or DataFlows (by checking their checkboxes), clicking data_center_bulk_tag_icon.png to open the tagging dialog, then adding tags as desired. For more information about this dialog, see the entry for "Add Tag" in this table.  
While in the list view for a DataSet or DataFlow, if you click a tag, the list filters to show only DataSets and DataFlows with that tag.  |
| Options icon

### Overview tab


In the **Overview** tab you can see how the DataSet is being used, the number of Cards powered from this DataSet, the number of users it is being shared with, the number of DataFlows created from the DataSet, and the number of Alerts on the DataSet. All of these tiles also provide "jump-off points" to other actions in Domo using this DataSet. The following screenshot shows an example of these tiles in the **Overview** tab for a typical DataSet.


![Overview_Tab.png](Overview_Tab.png)  


"Jump-off points" for these tiles are as follows:


* **View Full Impact**opens the Lineage tab for the DataSet.
* **Create A Visualization** opens the Analyzer for this DataSet so you can build a chart or table from it. For more information about Analyzer, see [Analyzer Overview](/s/article/360043428673 "Analyzer Overview").
* **Share This DataSet** opens the menu to share the DataSet with users.
* **Tidy Up This DataSet** opens the interface for building an ETL DataFlow using this DataSet.
* **Create A New Alert** opens the interface for creating an Alert on the DataSet.


### Data tab


In the **Data** tab, you can do all of the following:


* View all of the rows in the DataSet, and sort and filter to show the data interests you.
* See statistics for individual columns or for the entire DataSet.
* Change the order of columns in the DataSet.
* Rename columns in the DataSet.
* Add or edit column descriptions.
* Add search tags for columns.


The **Data** tabis made up of three subtabs —**Table**, **Schema**, and **Stats**. You can switch between the subtabs by clicking the desired subtab name in the upper right corner of the **Data** tab.


![Data_Subtabs.png](Data_Subtabs.png)


In all three subtabs, you can search for and filter to a specific column or columns in the DataSet by entering the desired column name in the **Search****Columns** field.


![Search.png](Search.png)


You can enlarge the column pane to fill the whole screen by clicking ![data_tab_full.png](data_tab_full.png) or restore it to its original size by clicking ![data_tab_shrink.png](data_tab_shrink.png). You can **Show column statistics/Hide column statistics** by clicking ![Show_Stats.png](Show_Stats.png). This allows you to show or hide the "filter charts" that appear at the top of the column pane in the **Table** subtab. Appears in the **Table** subtab only.


#### Table subtab


In the **Table** subtab, you can see all of the columns in your DataSet. Options are available for searching, sorting, and filtering so you can find the data you need. The following screenshot shows the components of the **Table** subtab:  
 


![Table_Layout.png](Table_Layout.png)  
  
 


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sort button
data_tab_table_sort_icon.png | Lets you sort the values in a given field in ascending or descending alphanumerical order. Sorts are "nested" based on the order in which you apply them. The numeral beneath the sort icon tells you the priority of this column in your sort. 
For example, if a user first applied an ascending sort to the "Transaction ID" column, all of the rows in the DataSet would be ordered in numerical order. If he then applied an ascending sort to the "SKU" column, the groupings of rows for each SKU would be ordered numerically. If he finally applied a third sort, descending, to the "Zip Code" column, those values would be sorted in descending order for each transaction-SKU grouping. 
The following screenshot shows an example of this behavior: Sort_Example.png  |
| Info button
data_tab_table_info_icon.png | Shows the description for this column, if you have added one in the **Schema** subtab. |
| Data type icon | Indicates the data type for this column. analyzer_data_table_numeric_type.png indicates a numeric (value) column, analyzer_data_table_date_type.png indicates a date or date-time column, and analyzer_data_table_string_type.png indicates a string column. For more information about data types, see [Understanding Chart Data](/s/article/360043428693 "Understanding Chart Data"). |
| Filter chart | Lets you filter the data in the DataSet based on the values in a given column. Different chart types appear for columns depending on the data type for that column.
For text (string) columns, a horizontal bar appears, divided into segments for each unique name in the column. You can filter the data in the DataSet to a particular name by clicking on that section in the bar. (Names appear as hovers when you mouse over a section.) In the following example, the user could filter the DataSet to show only the data for "Delivery Truck" by clicking on the corresponding bar.
data_tab_table_bar.png
For date/date-time and value columns, a vertical bar chart with a horizontal slider appears. You can filter the data in the DataSet to show dates or values above or below a certain threshold by sliding the bar accordingly. In the following example, the user could filter the DataSet to show only values of .05 or higher by sliding the bar to ".05." 
data_tab_table_slider.png |


#### 
Schema subtab


In the **Schema** subtab, you can reorder the columns in your DataSet, add descriptions and tags, etc. The following screenshot shows the components of the **Schema** subtab:  
 


![Schema_Tab.png](Schema_Tab.png)  
 


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Search field | Lets you search for and filter to a specific column or columns in the DataSet. |
| Reorder icon | Lets you change the order of columns in this DataSet by clicking and dragging a column into the desired position. Note that this option is only available for the "Index" column, and only when sorting has been applied to that column. So, for example, you could not sort by column name and then click and drag to reorder columns.  |
| Sort button | Lets you apply an ascending or descending sort to the column. Note that this sort *only* changes the order of column names in the **Schema** subtab so you can more easily find what you're looking for. It does *not* change the actual order of columns in the DataSet. If you want to change the column order, use the Reorder icon.  |
| Column description | Lets you enter a description for a column or edit an existing description. |
| Column tags | Lets you enter search tags for this column. For more information about tags, see the table under [DataSets and DataFlows Tabs](/s/article/360043430633 "Data Center Layout"). |





 




Stats subtab


In the **Stats** subtab, you can see Domo-generated statistics for the columns in your DataSet. For numeric and date/date-time columns, you can correlate the columns against other numeric columns in the DataSet, and for text columns, you can see the highest aggregated values for the sum or count of any selected column. The following screenshot shows the components of the **Schema** subtab:  
 


![Stats_Subtab.png](Stats_Subtab.png)  
 


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Search field | Lets you search for and filter to a specific column or columns in the DataSet. |
| Column stats row | Shows statistics for a given column.  |
| Statistics for date/numeric column | Shows automatically-generated statistics for a numeric or date/date-time column. Available statistics include minimum, maximum, average, median, upper and lower quartile, and standard deviation. |
| Statistics for string column | Shows automatically-generated statistics for a string column. Available statistics include shortest string, longest string, and average length. |
| Correlations chart | Shows correlations for numeric and date/date-time columns. For the given numeric or date/date-time column, you can select any other numeric column and see how the two columns correlate.  |
| Aggregations chart | Shows the five highest aggregated values of the given column from the selected column. If the selected column is numeric, the values are summed; otherwise the values are counted. For example, in the above screenshot, the user has chosen to view the five highest aggregated sales values for the "Customer Name" column. He does this by selecting "Sales" in the **Aggregations** dropdown for the "Customer Name" column. |


### 
Cards tab


The following screenshot shows the components of the **Cards** tab:


![Cards_Tab.png](Cards_Tab.png)


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connected Cards | All cards powered by this DataSet. You can click on a card to see the [Details view](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/428BA51/Understanding+card+Details+views) for that Card.


 


**Tip:**You can view Cards powered by a specific third-party application or data provider from the **Launcher** page. For more information, see [Viewing Cards for Data Providers](/s/article/360043430673 "Viewing Cards for Data Providers").


 |
| Switch cards to a different DataSet option | Allows you to move all of the Cards powered by this DataSet to another DataSet. This option appears if you are the owner of the DataSet, depending on the DataSet type. For more information, see [Connecting Cards to a Different DataSet](/s/article/360043430653 "Connecting Cards to a Different DataSet"). |
| Add Card option | Lets you power up a Card using the DataSet. Select the DataSet from the list to use it in powering a card. By default, the Card is added to the Overview page in Domo. This option may not appear, depending on the DataSet type. For more information about this option, see [Powering a Visualization Card with Data](/s/article/360043429873 "KPI Card Building Part 1: Powering Your Card").  |


### 
History tab


In the **History** tab, you can see a listing of all of the times this DataSet has been updated. This tab shows the start and end times for all updates, the amount of time the update took (duration), whether the update was scheduled or manual, and the result of the update (successful or failed). You can also see the amount of time that has transpired since the last successful run, the average update duration, and the overall success rate. Finally, for any history item, several actions are available by mousing over the row and clicking the wrench icon.


The following screenshot shows an example of a **History** tab for a DataSet called "Compensation Costs":


![History_Tab.png](History_Tab.png)


Action items available by clicking the wrench icon are as follows:


* **Preview updated rows**. Displays the rows in the DataSet that were changed when this update occurred.
* **Download**. Downloads the data in this version of the DataSet as a flat text file that can be opened in an Internet browser or word processor.
* **Delete this update**. Deletes this version of the DataSet from your history.
* **Revert to this point**. Reverts the DataSet to this version.


Actions are available only for successful updates.


### Settings tab


In the **Settings** tab for a DataSet, you have access to the options used to set up this DataSet, similar to the view that appears when you initially configure a connector DataSet. Click a row to open up the settings in that row for viewing and editing. Settings categories may differ between connectors. For more information about connector configuration options, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "General Guide to Connecting with Connectors").


![Settings_Tab.png](Settings_Tab.png)


### Data Lineage tab


In the Data Lineage tab for a DataSet, you can see the DataSets that have been combined and/or transformed through DataFlows or DataFusion to yield this DataSet. The Data Lineage interface in Data Center is the same as that used for a DataSet in Analyzer. For more information, see Viewing the Lineage of a DataSet in Analyzer.


### Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) tab


Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) allow you to create a customized experience for each Domo user through the definition of Entitlement Policies. Using Entitlement Policies, you can filter data in a DataSet for specified users and/or groups. For more information, see [Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)](/s/article/360042934614 "Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)").


The following screenshot points out the most important parts of the PDP tab:  
 


![PDP_Tab.png](PDP_Tab.png)


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Search field | Lets you search for existing policies that have been added to this DataSet. |
| Policy row | Shows information about a policy, including its name, the rows of data it provides access to, and the groups and users the policy has been applied to.  |
| Enable PDP toggle | Activates/deactivates this PDP policy. |
| Impact button | Opens a list of cards and alerts that will be affected by PDP policies on this DataSet.  |
| Add Policy button | Lets you add a new PDP policy to this DataSet. For more information about adding a PDP policy, see [Creating and Deleting PDP Policies](/s/article/360042934614 "Creating and Deleting PDP Policies"). |



View Details (DataFlows)
-------------------------


When you click the name of a DataFlow or click ![Wrench.png](Wrench.png) > **View Details**, a page appears showing details for the DataFlow. This page is divided into tabs—​​**Settings**, **DataSet****s**, **History**, and **Versions**. For more information about these tabs, see [Viewing DataFlow Details](/s/article/360042923054 "Viewing DataFlow Details").


Editor view (MySQL and Redshift DataFlows)
------------------------------------------


The following screenshot shows you the main components of the **Create**/**Edit DataFlow** view for a MySQL or Redshift DataFlow.


![dataflow_layout.png](dataflow_layout.png)


You can refer to the following table to learn more about each component:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DataFlow Type & Info | When collapsed, this panel displays the type of DataFlow and the schema.
When expanded (by clicking mysql_info.png), this panel displays information about the RDS instance for this DataFlow, including the host name, schema, user name, password, and port number. You can copy and paste this information into any SQL tool, including Workbench. |
| DataFlow Name & Description | Allows you to specify a name and description for this DataFlow. |
| Input DataSets | Allows you to select one or more existing DataSets for use in creating DataFlows. You can choose as many input DataSets as you want. For any given transform or output, you can use one, some, or all of the DataSets you select here. This is essentially a storage area for DataSets you may potentially use. You *cannot* manipulate data in the DataSets at this stage. You also cannot select the same input DataSet twice in the same DataFlow.


 


**Note:**Input DataSets in a DataFlow *must* already exist in Domo; you cannot upload new DataSets in the **Create DataFlow** view. For information about uploading new DataSets to Domo, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Connecting to Data with Connectors"). 



You can click an input DataSet you have added to see a preview of the DataSet. |
| Transforms | Allows you to manipulate data in your input DataSets using SQL statements before you make your final manipulations in the Output DataSets stage. The Transforms stage is optional. All input DataSets you have selected are available for use in transforms. |
| Output DataSets | Allows you to specify how your input DataSets are to be combined to produce one or more output DataSets. This interface is almost the same as that of Transforms. However, while adding transforms is optional, the Output DataSets stage is required; otherwise you cannot save your DataFlow. All input DataSets and transforms you have selected/created for this DataFlow are available to be used in your Output DataSet SQL. |
| Save buttons | Allow you to save this DataFlow. Two separate buttons are available: **Save** and **Save and Run**. **Save** saves changes you have made to this DataFlow and adds it to the DataFlows listing in the Data Center but does *not* generate a DataSet (or, if you are editing an existing DataFlow, it does not update the output DataSets). **Save and Run** saves changes to the DataFlow and adds it to the DataFlows listing in the Data Center *and* runs the script for the DataFlow to output a DataSet (or update the output DataSets if it has already been created). |


For more information about DataFlows, see [SQL DataFlows](/s/article/360042922934 "ETL Magic DataFlows").


Editor view (Magic ETL DataFlows)
---------------------------------


For times when you need to transform your DataSets before you can make compelling visualizations, you can use Magic ETL DataFlows to transform multiple DataSets into a new DataSet that you can use to power up cards.




 


**Tip:**ETL means *Extract, Transform, and Load,* which refers to a process in database warehousing for extracting data, transforming it into proper format or structure for querying and analyzing purposes, and loading it into the target data warehouse. In Magic ETL DataFlows, your DataSets are extracted and loaded automatically, and transformed based on actions in the Magic ETL DataFlow.



Magic ETL DataFlows let you visually define and sequence operations to transform your Domo DataSets—without learning SQL or leaving Domo. For information about the Magic ETL DataFlow tiles, see all of the following:

Accounts tab
============


In the Accounts tab, you can manage third-party system accounts associated with DataSets in Domo. You can view accounts associated with DataSets; add, edit, or delete accounts; and associate DataSets with another account.




 


**Tip:**By creating accounts to data source systems, you can specify and maintain your credentials in one central place, then create DataSets in Domo using the account—without having to specify your credentials to the data source system.



In the **Accounts** tab, you can


* add user accounts for different connectors (similar to a DSN)
* view a list of user accounts you have added
* disconnect accounts you have added
* share accounts with other users
* see DataSets you have access to
* transfer DataSets from one account to another account
* change account associations
* rename accounts
* visually identify DataSets needing attention
* edit credentials for accounts that require manual authentication (as opposed to those that use OAuth)


The following screenshot calls out the most important parts of the **Accounts**tab:


![accounts_tab2.png](accounts_tab2.png)


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Search box | Lets you filter the accounts in the list. |
| Add Account button | Lets you add a new user account to this list. |
| Add Federated button | Lets you add a Federated account to this list. |

| Connector accounts | Provide information and options for all accounts you have used to connect to data sources, including the account name, the usernames or handles you use to connect, and options such as share, reconnect, etc.
For each account, you can ado the following:* Click an account to open a panel in which you can edit the account information. For all accounts, you can edit the name. For non-OAuth accounts (those in which you must authenticate manually), you can also edit the account credentials.
* Mouse over the **DataSets** item to see a list of DataSets powered by this account. These are categorized according to whether they are owned by you or another user. You can click a DataSet to open the [Details view](#WhatarethedifferentpartsoftheDataCenterpage?-ViewDetails "http://wiki.domo.com/#WhatarethedifferentpartsoftheDataCenterpage?-ViewDetails") for that DataSet. You can also transfer ownership of the account to another user or change the account credentials for multiple DataSets.
* Mouse over the account to display the **Options** icon. Wrench.png
 |
| Options icon
Wrench.png
  | Lets you access various options for working with this account, including the following:* **Edit account**. Lets you edit the name and credentials for this account.
* **Share account**. Lets you share user accounts with others so they can access the DataSets through the connector.
* **Reconnect**. Lets you reconnect any connectors that use oAuth for authentication. If the connector requires manual authentication, this icon does not appear.
* **Delete account**. Lets you remove an account, in which case any associated DataSets depending on the account to power up cards may stop functioning.

Beast Mode Manager tab
----------------------


In the **Beast Mode Manager** tab in the Data Center, you can view statistics on Beast Mode usage as well as perform various actions, such as editing formulas, locking and unlocking calculations, deleting unwanted calculations, and so on.


The following screenshot calls out the most important parts of the main screen (Overview) of the **Beast Mode Manager**tab:  
 


![beast_mode_manager_layout_overview.png](beast_mode_manager_layout_overview.png)


You can learn about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| List of calculations | Shows all of the calculations in your Domo instance you have access to see. You can filter the list by entering search keywords in the **Search Beast Modes** field; by filtering on certain criteria such as name, owner, or status (valid or invalid); or by clicking on a card in the Dashboard.
If you are the calculation owner or have a grant with the "Manage All Cards and Pages" role enabled, you can also select calculations in this list. When you select calculations, a wrench menu appears at the top of the list. This menu contains actions you can apply to calculations in bulk, such as locking/unlocking calculations, changing calculation owners, and duplicating calculations to other DataSets.     |
| Filter button | Lets you filter the calculations in the list by any of a variety of criteria, including  Beast Mode type (Card of DataSet), locked or unlocked status, owner, etc. |
