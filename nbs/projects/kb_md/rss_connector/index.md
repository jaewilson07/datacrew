Intro
------


Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a means by which publishers of content offer feeds to their consumers. Using the Domo RSS Connector, you can retrieve data from any content provider using the standard RSS format and integrate it into Domo.


The RSS connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking **Cloud App** in the toolbar at the top of the window.


You create an RSS DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the RSS connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To pull RSS feed data from a content provider, you must have the URL of the desired RSS feed.


Creating an RSS DataSet
-----------------------


This section describes how to create an RSS DataSet in the RSS Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Details Pane


This pane contains two menus in which you specify your RSS feed URL and the desired number of responses.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RSS URL | Enter the URL for the RSS feed you want to retrieve. |
| Number of Responses | Enter the limit on the number of responses in your report.  |


### Other Panes


For information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274).
