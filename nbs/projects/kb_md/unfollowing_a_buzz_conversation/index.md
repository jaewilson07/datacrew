In Domo, when a Buzz conversation is sent to a group of which you are a member or you are manually added as a recipient of such a conversation, by default you receive notifications for ALL future posts in the conversation. You can unfollow a Buzz conversation so you do not receive further notifications for that conversation. You do this by selecting the **Unfollow Conversation** option in the Details pane for the conversation. 


**To unfollow a Buzz conversation,**






**Note:** Buzz conversations can be unfollowed, but not deleted.

1. Open the Buzz conversation you want to unfollow.
2. (Conditional) If you are not in full-screen mode, click the ellipsis icon (...) to open the Details pane for the conversation.
3. Select **Unfollow Conversation**.


After you have unfollowed a conversation, you can refollow so you continue to receive notifications for posts in the conversation as normal. 


**To refollow a Buzz conversation,**


1. Open the Buzz conversation you want to follow.
2. (Conditional) If you are not in full-screen mode, click the ellipsis icon (...) to open the Details pane for the conversation.
3. Select **Follow** **Conversation**.
