Intro
-----


Microsoft SharePoint Online enables an organization to easily create and manage custom team-focused and project-focused sites for collaboration. You can use Domo's Microsoft SharePoint Online REST Connector to get the data from an organization-wide intranet portal in different aspects based on sites within Domo. To do this, you must first create an app in Microsoft Azure. For more information about the Microsoft Sharepoint Online, visit their website at <https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-online-collaboration-software>. 


You create a Microsoft Sharepoint Online connection in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Sharepoint Online REST connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to Microsoft Sharepoint Online in order to retrieve information, you must have the following:


* An installed Microsoft Azure app.
* The secret ID and value for your Azure app. To generate an app and locate these credentials, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). You may need the following information to register for the app:


	+ **Azure Portal:** <https://portal.azure.com/>
	+ **Sharepoint App to Register:** SharePoint Online Rest API
	+ **Domo Re-direct URL:** <https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/microsoft-sharepoint/exchange>



### To Obtain the Sharepoint Secret ID:


1. Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/ "https://portal.azure.com").
2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
3. Find and click on your web app.
4. The "application" ID is your secret ID.





 


### To obtain the Sharepoint Value:


1. Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/ "https://portal.azure.com").
2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
3. Find and click on your web app.
4. Open **Certificates and secrets**.
5. Click **+New Value**.
6. Provide the value description and the expiry period for your secret. Click **Add**.
7. Your new value will appear. Copy the Value field and paste it in your Domo connector Value field.

Connecting to Microsoft Sharepoint Online
-----------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Microsoft Sharepoint Online REST Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").



```
**Note:** Use Microsoft Account that has The Cloud Application Administrator role in [admin.microsoft.com](http://admin.microsoft.com)
```

#### What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?


You need the client id and client secret associated with your Microsoft account.


#### Where can I find the client id and client secret?


You need an installed Microsoft Azure app to get the client id and client secret.


To obtain the client id:


1. Visit [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
3. Find your app and click on it.
4. Locate the "Application ID" from the web app. The Application ID is the client id.


To obtain the client's secret:


The client secret is generated when you create your Azure app. To generate new client secret


1. Visit [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
3. Find your app and click on it.
4. Open **Settings > Keys**.
5. Create the client's secret.


#### How often can the data be updated?


As often as needed.


#### Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?


No


### Troubleshooting


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
