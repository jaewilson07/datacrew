Intro
-----


You’ve Got Leads delivers web-based customer relationship management solutions to senior living communities. Use Domo's You've Got Leads connector to retrieve referral data for senior living communities. To learn more about the You've Got Leads API, visit their page ([https://www.youvegotleads.com/webser.../documentation](https://www.youvegotleads.com/webservices/documentation "https://www.youvegotleads.com/webservices/documentation")).


You connect to your You've Got Leads account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the You've Got Leads connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your You've Got Leads account and create a DataSet, you must have your You've Got Leads username and password.


Connecting to Your You've Got Leads Account

This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the You've Got Leads Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").

Once you have entered valid You've Got Leads credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new You've Got Leads DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
