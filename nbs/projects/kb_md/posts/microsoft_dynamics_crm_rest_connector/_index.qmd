Intro
-----


Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a CRM business solution that drives sales productivity and marketing effectiveness through social insights, business intelligence and campaign management. The Domo Microsoft Dynamics CRM REST Connector allows you to retrieve data on your defined entities within Microsoft Dynamics CRM. To do this, you must first create an app in Microsoft Azure. For more information about the Microsoft Dynamics CRM API, visit their website. ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/lib.../bb928212.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb928212.aspx "https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb928212.aspx")). For more information about Azure, see <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/>. 


You connect to your Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM REST connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](https://domohelp.domo.com/Connect/Connecting_to_Data_with_Connectors/General_Guide_to_Connecting_with_Connectors/01Adding_a_DataSet_Using_a_Data_Connector).

Prerequisites

To connect to your Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation in order to retrieve information, you must have the following:


* An installed Microsoft Azure app.
* Your Azure tenant domain. To find your tenant domain, do the following:


	1. Go to [portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.
	2. Select **Azure Active Directory > Properties**.
	3. Locate the "Directory ID" (this is the tenant domain).

	2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
	3. Find your app and click on it.
	4. Locate the "Application ID" from the web app (this is the client ID).
* The client secret for your Azure app. This is generated when you create your Azure app. To generate a new client secret, do the following:


	1. Go to [portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com) and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.
	2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**.
	3. Find your app and click on it.

Connecting to Your Microsoft Dynamics CRM Installation
------------------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM REST Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](https://domohelp.domo.com/Connect/Connecting_to_Data_with_Connectors/General_Guide_to_Connecting_with_Connectors/01Adding_a_DataSet_Using_a_Data_Connector "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to a Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation via Azure. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant Domain | Enter your Azure tenant domain. For more information about finding this, see "Prerequisites," above. |
| Client ID | Enter the client ID for your installed Azure web app. For more information about finding this, see "Prerequisites," above. |
| Client Secret | Enter the client secret that was generated when you created your app. For information about generating a new key, see "Prerequisites," above. |
| Resource | Enter the name of the resource you want to connect to. |


Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Microsoft Dynamics CRM REST DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](https://domohelp.domo.com/Connect/Managing_DataSets/02Managing_User_Accounts_for_Connectors "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains menus in which you can select a Microsoft Dynamics CRM entity and specify other options for your report.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Entity | Select the entity for your report. This list includes every entity in the Dynamics CRM installation that the authenticated user has access to. |
| Fetch All Data? | Specify whether you want to retrieve all available data. If you select **No**, you will choose the data you want by specifying filter options. |
| Attributes | Select all attributes for the given entity you want to appear in your report. This menu is not populated until you select an entity in the **Entity** menu. |
| Advanced Options | Check this box if you want to filter your data using attribute filters. |
| Filter On | Select the attribute you want to use to filter resulting entities. The list includes all attributes for the selected entity if it does not have the createdon attribute. Otherwise you can filter entities using the createdon attribute. |
| Duration  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.  |
| Report Date  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.  |
| Select Specific Date  | Select the date for the report.  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.   |
| Start Date | Specify whether the first date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the last date in your range in **End Date**.  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in **Start Date**.   |
| Select Specific Start Date | Select the first date in your date range.  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with **Days Back to End At** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for **Days Back to Start From** and 5 for **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with **Days Back to Start From** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for **Days Back to Start From** and 5 for **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |
| Filter Condition | Select the operator you want to use in your filter. |
| Filter Value | Enter the desired filter value. |
