Intro
-----


RetailOps' innovative cloud-based platform solves the unique problems facing modern ecommerce and omnichannel retailers today. To learn more about the RetailOps API, visit their page ([https://retailops.zendesk.com/hc/en-...I-Integrations](https://retailops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200824959-Channel-and-API-Integrations "https://retailops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200824959-Channel-and-API-Integrations")).


You connect to your RetailOps account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the RetailOps connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your RetailOps account and create a DataSet, you must have a RetailOps API key. You can learn how create a key by navigating to [https://retailops.zendesk.com/hc/en-...-RetailOps-API](https://retailops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206283535-Getting-Started-with-the-RetailOps-API "https://retailops.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206283535-Getting-Started-with-the-RetailOps-API") and following the steps under "Create an API key."


Connecting to Your RetailOps Account
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the RetailOps Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your RetailOps account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API Key | Enter your RetailOps API key. For information about generating a key, see "Prerequisites," above. |


Once you have entered valid RetailOps credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new RetailOps DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primary **Reports** menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Select the RetailOps report you want to run. The following reports are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Channels | Returns a list of channels associated with a RetailOps account. |
| Customers | Returns data about customers who have made orders. |
| Download Report | Downloads a custom report with a given RetailOps Report ID.  |
| Facilities | Returns data about facilities. |
| Orders | Returns data about orders in a RetailOps account. |
| Order Items | Returns records of items associated with a given number of order item IDs. |
| Shipments | Returns data associated with shipments. |
| Users | Returns data about users registered in RetailOps. |

 |
| Report ID | Enter the ID for the RetailOps Report you want to pull into Domo. |
| Duration  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.  |
| Report Date  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.  |
| Select Specific Date  | Select the date for the report.  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.   |
| Start Date | Specify whether the first date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the last date in your range in **End Date**.  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in **Start Date**.   |
| Select Specific Start Date | Select the first date in your date range.  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with **Days Back to End At** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for **Days Back to Start From** and 5 for **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with **Days Back to Start From** to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you entered 10 for **Days Back to Start From** and 5 for **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. |
