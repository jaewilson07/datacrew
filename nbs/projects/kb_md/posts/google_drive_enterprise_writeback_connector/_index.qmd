Intro
-----


Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google that allows users to store files in the cloud, synchronize files across devices, and share files. Use this connector to export your data from a Domo DataSet into Google Drive. To learn more about the Google Drive API, visit their page ([https://developers.google.com/drive/](https://developers.google.com/drive/ "https://developers.google.com/drive/")).


You export data to Google Drive in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Drive Enterprise Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").







**Note:** The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.




Prerequisites
-------------


To configure this connector, you will need the following:


* A project created in the Google Developers Console with the Google Drive and Google People APIs enabled (for more information about the Google People API, see <https://developers.google.com/people/?hl=en_US>)
* A Domo Client ID and Client Secret
* A Google developer client ID and client secret


For information about obtaining a Google developer client ID and client secret, see the following: <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2#basicsteps>


The following steps explain in detail how to create your project. 


### Step 1: Creating a Project in the Google Developers Console


To create a project in the Google Developers Console, do the following:


1. Go to [https://console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com "https://console.developers.google.com").
2. Click the dropdown arrow next to **My Project**.

3. Click **New Project**.

4. Name your project and select the parent folder.
5. Click **Create**. 




 


**Note:** You can also use an existing project if you want.


### Step 2: Enabling the Google Drive API


To enable the Google Drive API for your project, do the following:


1. In the Google Developers Console, select your project and click **Library**.

2. Search for the Google Drive API.
3. Click **Enable**.

### Step 3: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret


To create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:


1. Navigate to [https://developer.domo.com](https://developer.domo.com "https://developer.domo.com") and log in.
2. Click **New Client** (found under "My Account" in the top right corner).
3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of **Data** and **User**.  
  
![googledrive_writeback_6.png](googledrive_writeback_6.png)  
  
When you click **Create**, you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.
4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.


Configuring the Connection
--------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Google Drive Enterprise Writeback Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo developer account as well as your Google developer account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter your Google developer client ID. For more information, see "Prerequisites," above. |
| Client Secret | Enter your Google developer client secret. For more information, see "Prerequisites," above. |
| Domo Client ID | Paste the Domo client ID you copied in Step 3: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret, in the "Prerequisites" section above. |
| Domo Client Secret | Paste the Domo client secret you copied in Step 3: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret, in the "Prerequisites" section above. |


Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Google Drive connection. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Input DataSet ID | Enter the DataSet ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to Google Drive. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following datasources/. For example, in the URL <https://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview>, the DataSet ID is 845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.  |
| Select Filename | Select whether you want to reference your DataSet using the ****Input DataSet ID**** or an output file name.  |
| Enter Filename | Enter the output file name for your data.  |
| MIME Type | Select the MIME type for your data.  |


### Other Panes


For information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").
