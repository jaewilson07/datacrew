You can create a QuickBooks DataSet Job in Workbench 5. When you select QuickBooks as your Data Source type, you can choose a QuickBooks report type and specify options such as fiscal year, date granularity, and so on.


**To create a QuickBooks DataSet Job in Workbench 5,**


1. Click the ![wb5_jobs_icon.png](wb5_jobs_icon.png) icon in the left-hand icon bar.
2. Click the "+" button in the top right corner of the jobs listing pane.
3. Select the desired account (Domo instance) in the **Domo Domain** dropdown menu.  
If you have only one account set up, that account is already chosen for you and the menu is unavailable.
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the DataSet Job.  
This is the name of the job as it appears in Workbench, *not* the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.
5. In the **Transport Type** menu, select **Local File Provider,** **External Process File Provider**, or **FTP/SFTP File Provider**.  
  
Descriptions for these transport methods are as follows:



| Transport Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Local File Provider | Lets you select a file from your machine or a network. |
| External Process File Provider  | Lets you use a third-party application to pull data into Domo using a script.  |
| FTP/SFTP File Provider | Lets you retrieve a file via FTP, SFTP (SSH-FTP), or FTPS (FTP-SSL) |
6. In the **Reader Type**menu, select **QuickBooks**.
7. In the **DataSet Name** field, enter the name of the DataSet. This is the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.  
This is the *only* setting you can change after saving the new job.
8. In the **DataSet Type** field, select the type of DataSet in the dropdown.  
The DataSet type you select or enter here is reflected as the connector type in Domo after you execute the job.
9. Enter a description for the DataSet if desired.  
This is the description of the DataSet as it appears in Domo.
10. Click **Create**.  
  
A new QuickBooks DataSet Job is added to the list of jobs for the currently authenticated account. Note that after creating the job, you cannot edit any of the settings you just configured except for the DataSet name. If you want to change any of the other settings, you must create a new job.
