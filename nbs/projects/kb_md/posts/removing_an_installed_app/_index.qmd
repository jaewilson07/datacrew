You can remove an app you have deployed to your Domo from the Appstore. Note that this action removes instances of the app *only* from your own Domo; if other instances have been installed in your company Domo by other users, these are not removed. Also note that the version of the app in the Appstore is unaffected.




 

**Note:**To remove an app, you must be the app owner (i.e. the person who deployed the app) or have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage Appstore" enabled. For more information about default security roles, see [Managing Custom Roles](/s/article/360043438973 "Default Security Role Reference").




**To remove an app from your Domo instance,**


1. Click **Appstore** in the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
2. Click the ![appstore_installed_tab_icon.png](appstore_installed_tab_icon.png)tab on the left side of the screen.
3. In the tab, locate and click the app you want to remove.  
 You can use the various filter and sorting options to locate the desired app. For more information, see [Appstore Layout](/s/article/360043438013 "Appstore Layout").
4. In the details view, click **Uninstall**, then confirm the action.


The app is removed from your Domo.
