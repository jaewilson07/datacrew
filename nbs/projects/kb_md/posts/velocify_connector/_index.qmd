Intro
-----


Velocify provides cloud-based intelligent sales automation software designed for fast-paced sales environments. Use Domo's Velocify connector to retrieve data about leads, campaigns, milestones, and the like. To learn more about the Velocify API, visit their page (<https://service.leads360.com/ClientService.asmx>).


There are two versions of the Velocify connector—this standard version and an advanced version. The only difference between these is that the advanced version allows you to pull in custom reports from Velocify, whereas the standard version does not. For information about the standard version, see [Velocify Advanced Connector](/s/article/360042928054 "Velocify Advanced Connector").


The Velocify connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking **Cloud App** in the toolbar at the top of the window.


You connect to your Velocify account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Velocify connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Velocify account and create a DataSet, you must have a Velocify username and password.


Connecting to Your Velocify Account
-----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Velocify Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Velocify account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the username you use to log into your Velocify account. |
| Password | Enter the password you use to log into your Velocify account. |


Once you have entered valid Velocify credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Velocify DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the Accounts tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a menu in which you select a Velocify report, along with other menus that may or may not appear depending on your selected report. The following table describes all of the reports you can create using the Velocify connector.




 

**Tip:** Velocify allows users to create a custom report through their UI, which is then accessible through the API. If you want to connect to a custom report in Domo, you can do so using the Velocify Advanced connector. If you would like to use this connector, speak to your Domo CSR.
