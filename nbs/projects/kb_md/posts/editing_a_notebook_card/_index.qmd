You can edit a Notebook Card in its Details view or from the Page view. You can *only* edit a Notebook Card from the Page view if [Domo Stories Dashboards](/s/article/360043428433 "Creating Domo Stories") are enabled for the Page. When you open the edit view for a Notebook Card, it becomes locked (i.e. no one else can edit it) until you leave the edit view.


#### To edit a Notebook Card from the Details view,


1. Click the Card you want to edit.  
The Details view appears.
2. In the Details view, make the desired change to the Notebook content.  
For information about editing options, see [Adding a Notebook Card](/s/article/360043430233 "Adding a Notebook Card").


Any changes you make to an existing Card are saved automatically, as indicated by the checkmark to the left of the toolbar.


For more information about the Notebook Card Details view, see [Notebook Card Details view](/s/article/360042923934 "Card Details View Layout").


#### To edit a Notebook Card from the Page view,


1. Select **Edit Dashboard** from the wrench menu in the top right corner of the screen.  
If you do not have Domo Stories enabled for the Page, this option is not available. For more information about Domo Stories, see [Creating Domo Stories](/s/article/360043428433 "Creating Domo Stories").
2. Mouse over the Notebook Card you want to edit and click the pencil icon. ![dashboard_layout_pencil.png](dashboard_layout_pencil.png)
3. Make your edits as desired.

The inline Notebook Card editor has most of the same options as the Details editor, but not all. The following options are *not* available in the inline editor:


* Vertical alignment
* Horizontal alignment
* Dynamic Summary Numbers


For more information about editing options, see [Adding a Notebook Card](/s/article/360043430233 "Adding a Notebook Card").
