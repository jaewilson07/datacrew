Intro
-----


You can use Domo's YouTube Enterprise Connector to retrieve viewing statistics, popularity metrics, and demographic information for YouTube videos and channels. To learn more about the YouTube API, visit their page ([https://developers.google.com/youtube/](https://developers.google.com/youtube/ "https://developers.google.com/youtube/")).




 


**Note:** There are currently 5 YouTube Connectors available in Domo. The difference between these may be difficult to understand, so here is an explanation of each: 


* **YouTube Reporting Connector -** This is our entry-level YouTube Connector. It requires only a Google username and password to authenticate. Most Domo users should use this Connector to retrieve YouTube data.
* **YouTube Reporting Enterprise Connector -** This is the enterprise version of the YouTube Reporting Connector. This report has a few additional reports and requires you to enter a Google Client ID and Client Secret in addition to a basic Google username and password.
* **YouTube Enterprise Advanced Connector -** This is Domo's most advanced YouTube Connector. (This is the only version of the YouTube Enterprise Connector; there is no Connector simply called "YouTube Enterprise.") It requires a Google Client ID and Client Secret as well as a Google username and password. It provides more reports and options than the other YouTube Connectors but is also more complicated and much more difficult to configure. This Connector is recommended for advanced users only.
* **YouTube Reporting Partition Connector** **-** This offers the same reports as the YouTube Reporting Connector, with the added ability to use Partitioning in the DataSet.
* **YouTube Reporting Enterprise Partition Connector** **-** This offers the same reports as the YouTube Reporting Enterprise Connector, with the added ability to use Partitioning in the DataSet.






The YouTube Enterprise Connector is a "Cloud App" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking **Cloud App** in the toolbar at the top of the window.


You connect to your YouTube Enterprise account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the YouTube Enterprise Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector.](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector")


Best practices
--------------


When you first power up the Connector and request historical data, it takes around 30 days to bring in all the data. This is due to how the YouTube API functions. For example, if a report is first started on April 1, data from April 1 onward will be available 24-48 hours later. Every day, a few more days prior to April 1 will be available. After around 30 days, 6 months of backfill data will have been added to the report (though it comes in a rather sporadic order). In this example, by April 30 the user should end up with 7 months of —data for April, plus the 6 prior months.


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your YouTube Enterprise account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:


* A Google Client ID.
* A Google Client Secret.
* A Google username and password.


For step-by-step instructions on obtaining a Client ID and Client Secret, see [https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849 "https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#generatingoauth2").




 


**Note:** For multiple YouTube Enterprise Advanced accounts in Domo, you must click the Google+ API checkbox in the Google API when creating the Client ID and Client Secret. If the Google+ API box is not checked, then any new YouTube Enterprise Advanced account in Domo will override the current credentials.



You must also enable the Google People API to properly configure this Connector. For more information about this API, see <https://developers.google.com/people/?hl=en_US>.

Connecting to your YouTube Enterprise account
---------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the  **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the YouTube Enterprise Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your YouTube Enterprise account. For information about obtaining these credentials, see "Prerequisites," above. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter your Google Client ID. |
| Client Secret | Enter your Google Client Secret. |


 







**Note:** In order to create a client ID and secret, you will be asked to enter the following redirect URL: [https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/youtube-enterprise/exchange](https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/youtube-enterprise/exchange%22%22)




After you have entered valid credentials, you are taken to Google's OAuth page where you are prompted to enter your Google username and password. Once you have successfully authenticated, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new YouTube Reporting Enterprise DataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the **Accounts**tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details pane


This pane contains two primary menus, **API** and **Report**, along with other menus which may appear depending on the selected API and report type.
