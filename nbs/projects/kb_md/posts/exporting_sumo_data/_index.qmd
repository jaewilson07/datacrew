You can export data from a [Sumo card](/s/article/360043428573 "Understanding Cards") to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file or .csv file. You can export data from a Sumo card in either the page view or the Details view and will include sorts, filters, and aggregations. It does *not* include any "Total" rows. Exporting data from **Pivot View** to Microsoft Excel does *not* generate a Pivot table but exports the rows of data, which could be used in generating a Pivot table.


If data in a card is filtered due to PDP policies, those filters are applied in the exported version.


For more information about applying sorts, filters, and aggregations to a Sumo card, see [Applying sorts, filters, and aggregations](/s/article/360042925674 "Adding a Sumo Card").


**To export Sumo data to Microsoft Excel or CSV,**


1. Navigate to the page in which the Sumo card is found.
2. Mouse over the card then select **Send / Export** from the **Options** menu.
3. Select **Excel** or **CSV.**


The data from this Sumo card is exported as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.
