Earning Rewards in Dojo
-----------------------


Rankings in the Dojo are a reflection of activity and engagement. The rank structure resembles the Karate Belt System. Upon registration, each member is given the "White Belt" rank.


As you ask questions, receive reactions on your posts, and reply to other discussions, you will accumulate points. The more points you have = the higher rank association you earn. 


As you uprank, you earn rewards. Some of the rewards include a Domopalooza ticket, VIP spotlight article posted on Dojo, and a physical black belt mailed to you with your name embroidered on it. To learn more about ranks and badges, see [Ranking & Badge System](https://dojo.domo.com/main/discussion/52264/ranking-badge-system#latest).
