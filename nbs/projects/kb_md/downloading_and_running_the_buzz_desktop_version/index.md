Running the Desktop Version of Buzz
-----------------------------------


Follow these steps to get going with the desktop version of Buzz.


**To run the desktop version of Buzz,**


1. (Conditional) If you just installed Buzz, it opens automatically. Otherwise, locate the Buzz file on your machine and double-click it.
2. Enter your company domain in the field. This is the portion of your company's Domo URL that comes before .[domo.com](http://domo.com). For example, if the URL of your company's Domo instance was [myURL.domo.com](http://myURL.domo.com), you would enter myURL. 




 


**Tip:**If at any time you want to return to this screen to add a new domain, you may do so by selecting **Team > Add Team.**
3. Click **Continue**.  
   
 One of two things now happens:


	* If you are already signed into the Domo instance you specified in step 2, a dialog appears asking if you want to sign in using your current credentials, as shown here:  
	   
	 ![buzz_desktop_signin.png](buzz_desktop_signin.png)  
	   
	 If this dialog appears, go to step 4.
	* Otherwise, the normal Domo login screen appears for the specified instance.   
	 ![login_screen.png](login_screen.png)  
	   
	 If this dialog appears, go to step 5.
4. (Conditional) If the sign-in dialog appears as shown in the first image above...


	* If you want to sign in using the account shown here, click **Sign In**.
	* Otherwise close the browser window, log out of Domo, reopen Buzz Desktop. enter your desired domain, then enter your credentials.
5. (Conditional) If the regular Domo login screen appears as shown in the second image above, enter your credentials, then click **Sign In**.


Buzz now opens on your desktop. You can now collaborate with coworkers just as you can in the online version of Buzz. For more information, see [Chatting in Buzz](/s/article/360042925574 "Chatting in Buzz"). 


The desktop version of Buzz includes a number of menu options not found in the online version. For descriptions of these, see [Desktop version toolbar options](/s/article/360043429973 "Buzz Layout").
