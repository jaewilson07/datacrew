Intro
-----


The **Asset Library** stores all of your assets in Domo, but each card is unique and can be powered by a different design version of an asset. If you update an asset, you may need to update each card individually. You can find instructions for doing this below in [Updating an Asset](#updating_asset).


In some cases, you may need to connect a card to a different asset. A possible use case is moving from a demo or custom version of an app to another version. This requires you to switch any cards to the correct asset. See instructions for [Switching an Asset](#switching_asset) below.


Updating an Asset
-----------------


1. From the navigation header, select **More** > **Asset Library**.
2. In the **Asset Library**, locate the app you want to update.

5. Go to the **Cards** tab. A list of cards deployed by the app displays.
6. Select the cards you want to update by checking the boxes.

7. Connect the card according to the instructions for that app in the Knowledge Base.
