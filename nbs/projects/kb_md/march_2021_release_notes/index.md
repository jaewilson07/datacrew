New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Build your own Writeback Connector


Using the Connector IDE, build a Writeback Connector that will send data from Domo to your external systems. Writeback Connectors give you the power to share data between your business systems that currently don't talk to each other. And now, if Domo’s library does not yet include what you need, you have the expanded ability to build your own. For more information, visit [https://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build](https://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build "https://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build").


### Data Science Home Page


The Data Science Home Page shows all of the powerful data science tools in one place, gives you quick access to the data science tools, outlines the products and services, and where tools fit into the data science maturity journey. For more information, see [Data Science Home Page](/s/article/1500003408882 "Data Science Home Page").


![Data_Science_Home_Page.png](Data_Science_Home_Page.png)


### Python and R SDK enhancements


The R and Python SDK's have been updated to use the same function naming for both languages and to have the same functions available in each. For more information, visit [https://developer.domo.com/docs/domo-sdks/sdks](https://developer.domo.com/docs/domo-sdks/sdks "https://developer.domo.com/docs/domo-sdks/sdks").


### Scheduled Reports security options


With the new Scheduled Reports security options, Admins now have the ability to enable the **Limit to Domo users** option. When this setting is configured, Domo blocks scheduled reports to any external email address, only email addresses tied to an existing account will receive reports. For more information, see [Scheduling Reports](/s/article/360043437773 "Scheduling Reports").


### Auto-Width Dashboards


With the Auto-Width Dashboard setting, Dashboard content will expand to fill all the available window space. This will allow for more rows/columns to be visible from the Dashboard view. This is enabled on a per-Dashboard basis to allow you to customize your Stories. For more information, see [Creating Domo Stories](/s/article/360043428433 "Creating Domo Stories").


 


### New custom import chart types


With the new custom import chart types, you can now create custom charts from more than just SVG files.


The following formats are now supported:


* **KML (keyhole markup language) -** is a file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser such as Google Earth.
* **GeoJSON -** is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes.
* **TopoJSON -** is an extension of GeoJSON that encodes geospatial topology and that typically provides smaller file sizes.
* **Shape -** is anESRI standard file format. Includes geospatial vector data (import Google Earth and export as KML.)


For more information, see [Custom Charts](/s/article/360042924454 "Custom Charts").


### Divergent colors


Divergent colors make it easy to quickly create and display range distributions by combining multiple color themes. Divergent colors allow you to pick any starting color and any ending color. In addition, you can pick the number of ranges to use. Divergent colors also provide you control of your midpoint. You can select the midpoint value and color or to not include the midpoint. For example, you can use diverging colors to make it easier to see hot to cold trends in your data by using a red theme combined with a green theme to show a more complete range of values. Divergent colors add this flexibility to Map and Heat Map Cards. For more information, see [Heat Map](/s/article/360042924634 "Heat Map").


![Heat_Map_Example.png](Heat_Map_Example.png)


### Week view in Calendar Cards


The week view in Calendar Cards add a new option to show as a “Week” view. This allows navigation by week and lets you customize the start of the week shown. For more information, see [Calendar](/s/article/360043427973 "Calendar").


![Calendar_Week.png](Calendar_Week.png)


### Dependency Gantt chart


The Dependency Gantt chart handles changes in dates for you and gives many new display options to communicate project timelines, such as:


* Calculate end dates from dependency and duration data.
* Show dependency data relationships.
* Display milestones.
* Show projects and sub-projects in a hierarchy.
* Allow resource tracking and representation in the chart.
* Smart date calculations – automatically account for weekends or display them.


For more information, see [Dependency Gantt Chart](/s/article/1500003419382).


![Dependency_Gantt_Chart.png](Dependency_Gantt_Chart.png)


### Progress bar color ranges


The Progress bar chart now has up to four color ranges that can be used to augment your chart. You can specify a minimum and maximum value for each range and select the corresponding color you would like to display. For more information, see [Progress Bar Gauge](/s/article/360043429493 "Progress Bar Gauge").


![Progress_Bar.png](Progress_Bar.png)


### Create a "top n" Trellis chart


The Trellis Chart Property now allows you to see just the top/bottom “n” in a category. For example, Top 5 Customers by Region. The Trellis Chart Property is found in most chart types. For more information, see [Properties Available for Most Charts](/s/article/360043429793 "Properties Available for Most Charts").


![Trellis_Chart.png](Trellis_Chart.png)


### Analyzer UI improvements


We’ve made it easier to work in Analyzer with the following improvements:


* Limit Rows in Analyzer is now grouped with Filter and Sort.
* Filter and Sort are combined into one section.
* Summary number dropdown and format changes now auto-saves, so you no longer need to click Apply.


For more information, see [Analyzer Layout](/s/article/360042924034 "Analyzer Layout").

### Saved Search


With the Saved Search feature, you can save and easily come back to your common searches—no matter how complex they are. For more information, see [Searching in Domo](/s/article/360043427393 "Searching in Domo").


![Saved_Search_edit.png](Saved_Search_edit.png)


### Regional formatting for multinational corporations


Regional formatting allows Admins to set date and number formats globally on the Domo platform based on your region. Users can also now select their region as well as their language. Formatting conventions based on your region will now be used to display numerical, financial, and date/time values based on your region. For more information, see [Setting Your Time Zone and Regional Formatting](/s/article/360042934394 "Setting Your Time Zone").


![Regional_Formatting_User.png](Regional_Formatting_User.png)


### Support for screen readers in Stories


Screen readers in Stories give expanded access for screen readers and keyboards to better enable customers to expose Domo content to users with accessibility requirements. Domo’s improved accessibility functionality allows customers to make their Cards screen reader-friendly, as well as find Stories, traverse layouts, and read Card details. For more information, see [Support for Screen Readers in Stories](/s/article/1500003263261 "Support for Screen Readers in Stories").


![Screen_Reader.png](Screen_Reader.png)


### Buzz Status


The Buzz Status feature allows you to set your status on web or mobile to **Available**, **Busy**, **Away**, or **Out of the office**. When someone sends you a 1:1 message or @mentions you in a conversation and your status is set to something other than Available, they will see a warning message that states you are unavailable. You can also add custom messaging to your status message when you are unavailable. An icon on your avatar indicates your current status. For more information, see [Buzz Layout](/s/article/360043429973 "Buzz Layout").

Domo makes it easy to:


* Automatically train and tune dozens of ML models.
* Launch hundreds of training jobs on any DataSet in Domo to find the model that achieves the best performance for your task.
* Easily deploy the model on your DataSet with the new AutoML tile in Magic ETL.
* All that is required to be successful with AutoML is a well-defined problem and a clean DataSet—Domo will take care of the rest.


For more information, see [AutoML (Machine Learning)](/s/article/360048127854 "AutoML (Machine Learning)").

For more information, see [Integration Studio](/s/article/360045163773 "Integration Studio (Beta)").


### Campaigns App SMS


The Campaigns App SMS add-on provides you with the ability to programmatically send SMS messages from Domo.
