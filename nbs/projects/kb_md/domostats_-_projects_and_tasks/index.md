Intro
-----


DomoStats gives you the freedom to explore how your team is using Domo. Because DomoStats is powered by a live Domo DataSet with no configuration, you can easily build cards, alerts, and workflows around the metrics you want to see as well as use the pre-built dashboard.


This DomoStats app provides key insights into your organization's Domo Projects and Tasks. Ensure projects will be delivered on time by monitoring all your open projects and tasks in a single dashboard. Identify at-risk projects, address overdue tasks, and manage team workloads by tracking assignee productivity and efficiency.

Requirements
------------


You must have Admin level access to download from the Appstore. 


Using the DomoStats App
-----------------------


You can use the pre-built dashboard or build any of your own content using the DomoStats DataSets in the Data Center. When you first download the app, a new page is created titled DomoStats - Projects and Tasks. You'll need to power up the dashboard with the following steps:


1. Navigate to the **DomoStats - Projects and Tasks** page.
2. Select **Connect Data**.
3. ![DomoStats_-_Project_and_Tasks_-_Connect_Data.png](DomoStats_-_Project_and_Tasks_-_Connect_Data.png)
4. In the drop-down, select **Connect** to connect the page to the DomoStats DataSets or select **Assign** if you want to assign another Domo user to set up the data.
5. In the last window, select **Connect**.

The dashboard
-------------


### Data


The following data is included in the download of the DomoStats - Projects and Tasks app and can be found in the Data Center as a 'DomoStats' type DataSet.


DataSets include:


* Projects
* Tasks
* Task Owners


DataFlows include:


* Projects and Tasks
* Tasks + Task Owners




 

**Note:** All DataSets powering the app run once a day. Runtime is every 24 hours from when the app is first deployed. While the run frequency cannot be changed, you can edit the runtime in the DataSet settings. For more information on how to schedule DataSets, see [DataSet Scheduling](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Cards


The following cards are included in the pre-built dashboard.

| Projects | Project Tracker | Displays the start date and due date for each project and measures the number of completed tasks against the number of total tasks to give an estimated completion percentage for each project.




**Note:** For best results, be sure to include a project due date for each of your projects within your Domo Projects and Tasks. When a project due date is not defined, the current date will be displayed as the due date on this card.
