FAQs
----


###### What are the limitations of a Domo Free trial account created via Snowflake Partner Connect?


Free trial accounts created via Snowflake Partner Connect are similar in nature to regular Domo 30-day free trial instances with one addition. Domo trial accounts created from Snowflake Partner Connect have the Snowflake writeback connector enabled which allows users to write data back to their Snowflake data warehouse if needed.


###### Why am I unable to create a Domo Trial account from Snowflake Partner Connect?


* Domo does not support new account sign-ups from personal email addresses (e.g. ['@gmail.com](mailto:'@gmail.com "mailto:'@gmail.com")' or ['@yahoo.com'](mailto:'@yahoo.com' "mailto:'@yahoo.com'")). If your Snowflake account is owned by a personal email address, you will be unable to complete the sign-up process. Please contact Domo Support to create a Trial account tied to your business email.   
 For more information on contacting Support, see [Getting Help](/s/article/360042922874 "Getting Help").
* Domo blocks email accounts of certain domains from creating Free Trial Domo accounts as mandated by Domo's Terms and Conditions.
* If you have previously set up a Free Trial account from a specified Snowflake account, you will not be able to create a new Domo Trial account.
* If the Snowflake account is also present as a user in Domo, the user will be prompted to connect to Snowflake via their existing Domo account.


###### Am I only restricted to Snowflake Sample data in the newly created Domo account?


No, the connection to Snowflake data is made for illustrative purposes only. Using Domo's federated connection, you can set up a new live query to your non-sample data.


See [Domo Federated Query](/s/article/360042932974 "Using the Federated Data Solution") for more information.
