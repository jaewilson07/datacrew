Intro
-----


To experience the best performance and most up-to-date features, it's important to have the latest version of Workbench. Domo Support can always help troubleshoot issues with legacy versions, but we provide our best support when you’re running the latest version. We strongly recommend that you check regularly and upgrade to the latest version if necessary.




 

**Note:** Before proceeding with any update or migration, you should back up your jobs. If there are issues or errors during the upgrade, you may need backups. If possible, ask your IT department to take a full snapshot or backup of your VM, Server, or PC before performing an upgrade.



  
This article outlines the upgrade to Workbench 5.2 in the following topics:
* [Identifying your current version](#IdentifyingYourCurrentVersion)
* [Downloading Workbench 5.2](#DownloadingWorkbench5.2)
* [Turning off automatic updates](#TurningOffAutomaticUpdates)
* [Upgrading error](#UpgradingError)


Identifying Your Current Version
--------------------------------


To determine which version of Workbench you are currently running, launch Workbench and note the version on the splash screen, as shown below.

If you choose to turn off automatic updates, we strongly recommend that you plan for regular manual maintenance and updates to ensure the best performance from your Workbench application.

Upgrading Error
---------------


If the error shown below displays in Workbench logs when upgrading a Workbench application, it is because the Microsoft .NET 4.8 Framework installer cannot make it through to the internet due to a proxy blocking it when upgrading Workbench.


You can get around this by going to [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0](http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0) and downloading the offline installer, then installing with it.
