Intro

When you create a card, you are automatically assigned as the owner. You can change the owner, add multiple owners, or add a group as the owner of a card.







**Note:** To change a card's owner, you must be the current owner, have an Admin default security role, or have a custom role with the Manage All Cards and Pages grant enabled. For more information about default security roles, see [Managing Custom Roles.](/s/article/360043438973)
