Intro
-----


Sometimes you may want to create many jobs in Workbench that are mostly similar but have a few unique details. It can be time-consuming and tedious to create each job individually. With the job duplication option, you can duplicate a job, keeping most of the details the same, and update only the details that need to be changed: the job name and the schedule.







**Note:** You must duplicate jobs one by one; bulk duplication is not supported.



Duplicating a Job
-----------------


1. Open the latest version of Workbench. You can download it in the Appstore.  
The homepage displays.


2. In the left navigation rail, select **![Screen_Shot_2022-10-04_at_7.31.15_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2022-10-04_at_7.31.15_PM.png) DataSet Jobs**.  
The DataSet Jobs page displays.


3. Right-click on the **Job Status** of the job you want to duplicate.  
The job options menu displays.


4. Select **Duplicate**.  
A dialog displays, confirming that you want to duplicate the job and stating that you are required to create a unique job name and set a new schedule for the duplicated job.

**Important:** Duplicating a job strips away any encryption transforms on a job.



5. Select **Continue** or **Cancel**.


* If you select **Continue**, you are redirected to the **Duplicate Job**workflow.
* If you select **Cancel**, you return to the jobs page.


6. In the **Overview** tab of the Duplicate Job workflow, enter a name in the **Job Name**field. This same name displays in the **DataSet Name**field and is how the DataSet displays in Domo.

7. Confirm that the other details in the **Overview**tab are correct, and select **Create**.  
The **Configure**, **Schedule**, **Schema**, and **Notifications** tabs display.


8. In the **Schedule** tab, set the schedule for the duplicated job.

9. Verify the details in the other tabs.


10. Select ![Screen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_6.16.01_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_6.16.01_PM.png) **Save**.


Your duplicated job runs according to the set schedule.
