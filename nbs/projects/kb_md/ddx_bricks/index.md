Intro
-----


DDX Bricks are pre-built objects that allow you to create advanced visualizations and apps that can be customized by simply copying and pasting code.


With DDX Bricks, business users, citizen developers, and full-stack developers can quickly iterate, prototype, and compose new apps with beautiful and advanced features. You can choose from Bricks available in the Domo Appstore. You can also use DDX Bricks to render a new library you found online — it’s as easy as copy and paste.


DDX Bricks lets you use HTML, CSS, and JS to completely customize your app. These new custom solutions visuals are immediately rendered and can be easily updated all within your Domo instance.


Now there is a seamless path for business users to progress from out-of-the box app building constraints to scalable, powerful, customized objects that extend Domo to meet any business need.
