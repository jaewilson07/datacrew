New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### New Global Search


With a brand-new search engine and powerful filters, Domo’s new search and discovery tool provides multiple ways to search and discover valuable information inside Domo. New filters enable you to use information that you know about what you are searching for without requiring you to use a keyword. For instance, what if you are looking for a card and you can’t remember the card name, but you know it was created recently by a teammate? By filtering based on owner and creation date, you can quickly discover the latest cards created by your teammate in a matter of seconds.


With a revamped search engine, keywords match not just on titles anymore; as you type, the engine goes deeper to match on descriptions, owner names, column names in DataSets, and even down to the content inside a document card.


Also, when you open an item from the Search window, clicking the Back button returns you to the Search, making it easy to quickly view different items from the same search.


Ultimately, you now have ways to find content in Domo when you need it, helping you get insights in real time and make smarter decisions.


![global_search_rn.png](global_search_rn.png)


The new global search functionality is available in both the web and mobile versions of Domo.


For more information, see [Searching in Domo](/s/article/360043427393 "Searching in Domo").


### New Alert Center


Domo’s revamped Alert Center puts all of the interesting, important, and actionable insights from your data at your fingertips, resulting in faster responses to real opportunities. Effective business leaders manage their organizations using metrics and goals to help ensure consistent progress and optimized performance. Domo helps businesses draw insights from more data sources than ever before. As the volume of data businesses harvest continues to grow, an organization’s ability to properly analyze all of the complex relationships in their data diminishes, but as of today, Domo’s all-new Alert Center fills this essential gap.

For more information, see [Alert Center Layout](/s/article/360043430373 "Alert Center Layout").


### New Version of Getting Started with Domo App


Domo has created a new and improved introductory training app called “Domo Basics: Getting Started with Domo.” The previous “Getting Started with Domo” app has been revised using a brand new learning interface and has been updated with the latest training content. The new version is designed to help new and existing Domo users learn the basics about using Domo to drive value within their organization and to introduce the steps that they need to take in order to execute against their desired outcomes.


The new version of the app includes the following features:


* **Navigation Pane**. We’ve redesigned the navigation pane in order make it easier to jump from page to page.  
   
 ![gswd_navpane.png](gswd_navpane.png)
* **Interactive Learning**. The training modules are no longer just videos, but include a variety of activities you can complete along the way.  
   
 ![gswd_interactive.png](gswd_interactive.png)
* **Quiz Time**. We've added quizzes to test your knowledge and put you on the right path.  
   
 ![gswd_quiz.png](gswd_quiz.png)
* **Additional Resources:** Direct links to the Knowledge Base provide you with more opportunities to deepen your expertise in specific areas.  
   
 ![gswd_engage.png](gswd_engage.png)


We encourage you to download the new app into your Domo instance and provide it to all new users as an introductory training course for using Domo. You can access the app by going to the Appstore and searching for "Getting Started.”




 

**Important:** The previous version of “Getting Started with Domo” will be deprecated on July 15th. Please delete this version from your instance after you download the updated version.
