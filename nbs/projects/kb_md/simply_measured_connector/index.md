Intro
-----


Simply Measured gives you in-depth measurement across your owned, earned, and paid social media. Use Domo's Simply Measured connector to retrieve a Simply Measured report from a specified collection. To learn more about the Simply Measured API, you can download their guide at [https://get.simplymeasured.com/2016-...v5suwowvha9vlk](https://get.simplymeasured.com/2016-10-24-how-our-API-works.html#sm.000001ksw6p6hiev5suwowvha9vlk "https://get.simplymeasured.com/2016-10-24-how-our-API-works.html#sm.000001ksw6p6hiev5suwowvha9vlk"). 


You connect to your Simply Measured account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Simply Measured connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Simply Measured account and create a DataSet, you must have a Simply Measured username and password.


Connecting to Your Simply Measured Account
------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Simply Measured Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling** and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Simply Measured account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter your Simply Measured username. |
| Password | Enter your Simply Measured password. |


Once you have entered valid Simply Measured credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Simply Measured DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](/s/article/360042926054 "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains menus from which you can select your Simply Measured collection and report.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Collection | Select the Simply Measured collection containing the report you want to pull into Domo. |
| Report | Select the desired Simply Measured report. |


### Other Panes


For information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](/s/article/360042926274 "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").
