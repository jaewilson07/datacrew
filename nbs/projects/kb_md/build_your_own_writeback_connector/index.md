Using the Connector IDE, build a Writeback Connector that will send data from Domo to your external systems. Writeback Connectors give you the power to share data between your business systems that currently don't talk to each other. And now, if Domoâ€™s library does not yet include what you need, you have the expanded ability to build your own.


For documentation about building custom Writeback Connectors in Domo, see [https://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build](https://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build "https://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build").
