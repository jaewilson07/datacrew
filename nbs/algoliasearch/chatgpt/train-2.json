A horizontal bar chart has the same overall concept, but the categories are represented along the vertical axis and the values are represented along the horizontal axis.\nPowering bar charts\nBoth vertical and horizontal bar charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories and one for values. However, you can add series columns to a vertical or horizontal bar chart if you want. Adding series data to a bar chart turns it into a different chart type, usually either a grouped bar chart, depending on the data.\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your bar chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nFor more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\u00a0Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.\nThe following graphic shows how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a vertical bar chart:\n\nThe following graphic shows how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a horizontal bar chart:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/bar_chart/index.html", "title": "Bar Chart"}, {"objectID": "0c04acbfa73c-1", "text": "Customizing bar charts\nYou can customize the appearance of a bar chart in a number of ways.

Here is an example of a basic case statement:CASE WHEN `column1` = \u2018good\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019 ELSE \u2018No\u2019 ENDThe ELSE portion is optional;\u00a0if there is no ELSE then the value will be NULL if it doesn\u2019t match the first portion.\nIf you have additional questions about how to implement functions properly in Beast Mode, review this article:\u00a0Beast Mode Functions Reference Guide\n\u00a0\nCan I use \"AND\" operators in Beast Mode?\nYes.\u00a0For example, you could do the following within a CASE function:\ncase when `Name` like 'Ca%' AND `id` < 10 then 0 else 1 end\n\u00a0\nCan I create custom or multiple summary numbers using Beast Mode?\nYes. For information and examples, see\u00a0Sample Beast Mode Calculations -- Creating a custom summary number.\n\u00a0\nCan I do \"value summing\" within Beast Mode?\nYes, this is\u00a0possible. For example:\nCASE WHEN `Status` in ('New Sales','Renewed') THEN SUM(`Revenue`)\nELSE 0\nEND", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/beast_mode_faqs/index.html", "title": "Beast Mode FAQs"}, {"objectID": "8212c9bfbdd3-2", "text": "ELSE 0\nEND\nBe aware, however, that you will probably not get the summed value you want, since the SUM takes\u00a0place within\u00a0the cell instead of the column. If this doesn't work for you, consider\u00a0using a\u00a0Summary Number instead of Beast Mode.\n\u00a0\nCan I do numerical comparisons using Beast Mode? For example, could I create a CASE statement to tell if a string is between a range of numbers?\nNo. So the following Beast Mode CASE statement would fail:\ncase when\npostcode > 0 then 1\nelse 0\nend\n\u00a0\nHow do I filter on multiple columns and conditions?\nSay you want to see how many client upsell opportunities closed (won or paused), but with the native Domo filter, you can't\u00a0apply multiple conditions to a row-level filter. To filter on multiple non-inclusive columns and conditions, you can create a logical Beast Mode calculation.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this situation, the Best Mode would look like this:\nCASE \nWHEN `opportunity_type` = \u2018upsell\u2019 AND `opportunity_won` = \u2018true\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\nWHEN `opportunity_type` = \u2018upsell\u2019 AND `opportunity_paused` = \u2018true\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\nELSE \u2018No\u2019\nEND\n\u00a0\nHow do I filter out certain dates?\nSay you want to see how many closed opportunities were won by day in a bar chart, but you want to filter out outliers, such as opportunities that were won within 10 days. To do this, you will want to create a Beast Mode calculation to use in the Filter field that will calculate the time from opportunity open to closed and then categorize them as\u00a0\u201cYes\u201d or\u00a0\u201cNo\u201d based on whether or not they closed within 10 days.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/beast_mode_faqs/index.html", "title": "Beast Mode FAQs"}, {"objectID": "8212c9bfbdd3-3", "text": "The Beast Mode you would create to this could be named \u201cOpty Closed within 10 Days?\u201d and look like this:\nCASE\nWHEN DATEDIFF(`Opportunity_Closed_Date`,`Opportunity_Open_Date`) <= 10 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\nWHEN DATEDIFF(`Opportunity_Closed_Date`,`Opportunity_Open_Date`) > 10 THEN \u2018No\u2019\nELSE \u2018Outlier\u2019\nEND\n\u00a0\nHow do I find the difference between two date columns without including weekends?\nUse a DATEDIFF\u00a0function then subtract\u00a02 for every week.\nHow do I filter data so the summary number matches the value displayed in the card?\nSay you have a map card of the United States that calculates\u00a0the sales amount broken out by state, and the summary number shows the total sales amount. However, the total sales amount in the card legend for the United States is lower than the summary number amount. The reason the sales amount in the Summary Number is larger is because the summary number takes into account all sales amounts regardless of country, and the card legend only shows the sales amounts for the United States. For this scenario, you will need to create a Beast Mode calculation that filters out the non-United States sales amounts.\nThe Beast Mode to do this would look like this:\nCASE \nWHEN `Country` = \u2018United States\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\nELSE \u2018No\u2019\nEND\nFor more information about summary numbers, see\u00a0Configuring Your Chart Summary Number.\n\u00a0\nCan I do \"percent of total\" functions in Beast Mode?\nNo, but you can insert a data label into your chart that contains the percent of total value by doing the following:\nIn Analyzer, open\u00a0Chart Properties.In Data Label Settings, enter %_PERCENT_OF_TOTAL\u00a0in the\u00a0Text\u00a0field.\n\u00a0\nWhy can't I put Beast Mode calculations in the Filter field?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/beast_mode_faqs/index.html", "title": "Beast Mode FAQs"}, {"objectID": "8212c9bfbdd3-4", "text": "Why can't I put Beast Mode calculations in the Filter field?\nThe filter in the Analyzer is based on row-level filtering on the DataSet level, so it doesn\u2019t filter on aggregates. To fix this, you can use the Magic ETL or SQL DataFlow tools to group and aggregate the columns for card and filtering usage. For more information about these tools, see\u00a0Prepare.\n\u00a0\nCan I create a rolling average calculation using Beast Mode?\nYou cannot create a rolling average calculation using Beast Mode, but you can create a card that displays a quarterly average. Or you can create a DataFlow that will calculate this.\u00a0\nWhy Beast Mode Can\u2019t Do This:\nA Beast Mode function is calculated on either a single record or group of records, depending on how the data on the card is being grouped. Because of that, the calculation doesn't have a way of referencing other records. For example, if you\u2019re looking for an average for April, you can't create a calculation that looks back at other records that come before April and have it sum these for you.\nAlternative 1: Show a quarterly average on a card.\nFollow these steps to show a quarterly average on a card.\u00a0\nTo show a quarterly average on a card,\nSet your date grain to \"by Quarter\" at the top of the card.For more information, see\u00a0Adding Filters to Your Chart.Add your date and value columns to the x- and y-axis, respectively.For more information, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.Set your aggregation option for your value column to AVG.\nAlternative 2: Create a DataFlow calculation\nYou can create this calculation in a DataFlow.

Unfortunately, many users make the mistake of using\u00a0a SUM function inside of the CASE statement:\nCASE\nWHEN `Column_1` = 'Value_1\u2019\nTHEN SUM(`Column_1`)\nEND\nInstead, you need to \u201cwrap\u201d the entire statement in a SUM function for it to execute properly:\nSUM(CASE\nWHEN `Column_1` = 'Value_1\u2019\nTHEN SUM(`Column_1`)\nEND)\n\u00a0\nHow can I aggregate a Beast Mode calculation to make it available as my Summary Number?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/beast_mode_faqs/index.html", "title": "Beast Mode FAQs"}, {"objectID": "8212c9bfbdd3-6", "text": "How can I aggregate a Beast Mode calculation to make it available as my Summary Number?\nUsers commonly attempt to use a Beast Mode calculation containing a CASE statement as a Summary Number.\u00a0For a value to be used as a Summary Number, that value must have a numeric data type. So if a calculation contains only a CASE statement, it will be seen by Domo as a string data type rather than a numeric data type.\nThe solution to adjusting a common CASE statement calculation into a field with a numeric data type is identical to our solution for conditional summing. Simply \u201cwrap\u201d the entire statement in an aggregation function, such as SUM or COUNT, like so:\nSUM(CASE\nWHEN `Column_1` = 'Value_1\u2019\nTHEN SUM(`Column_1`)\nEND)\nFor more information about summary numbers, see\u00a0Configuring Your Chart Summary Number.\n\u00a0\nHow do I aggregate an existing column using Beast Mode?\nSometimes users think that the only way to aggregate a column of data is by using a Beast Mode calculation. A better way is to\u00a0use tools within Domo\u2019s Analyzer to create aggregations of a value being used on the x-axis, y-axis, or series of the card in question.

However, you may only want to see the day and month values (01-15).\nYou can change the display of date values so you only see the day and month, using the DATE_FORMAT() function to reformat the date values:\nDATE_FORMAT(`DateColumn`,\u2019%d-%m\u2019)\nYou can also format dates in using\u00a0Chart Properties.

You can shift the dates values to another time zone by adding or subtracting time from the date values depending on what time zone you are switching it to. The functions that add and subtract time are DATE_ADD() and DATE_SUB().

Not only has the data processing engine been significantly upgraded making most DataFlows run remarkably faster and in more efficient ways, but new tiles and functionality have been added to make the most out of transforming your data using Magic ETL.\nThis article presents important Notable Behavior Changes you should make note of before upgrading Magic ETL as well as notes on new features.\nAll of the feature updates can be divided into four main categories:\nPerformanceNew/Updated TilesUser InterfaceAdvanced Options", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-1", "text": "Why Upgrade?\nWe wanted to make Magic ETL more internally consistent and more aligned with other Domo features like Beast Mode. One of our goals was to eliminate all cases where Magic ETL resolves column name collisions without the user's input. Joins and Append Rows both deal with name collisions, and Magic ETL now deals with both of them differently. We heard from many customers that this change is important for data cleanliness.\nRethinking auto-rename is just the start. Magic ETL now features a new formula system with over 200 functions inspired by Domo Beast Mode, various SQL databases, and Spreadsheet software. Formulas are a game-changer for Magic ETL. The functionality offered by the formula system goes beyond expressing a cluster of traditionally-configured tiles more concisely. In some cases, it even surpasses what is possible in a MySQL DataFlow. Formulas can be used to edit columns in place or add new columns.\u00a0or as part of a Group By or Filter Rows tile, to construct complex aggregations or filter conditions. For more information, see Writing Formulas in Magic ETL.\nFor the complete list of supported functions available in the new formula system, see Supported Functions in Magic ETL.\nNotable Behavior Changes\nSome changes in Magic ETL might cause transforms to work differently. This could manifest as errors like \u201cColumn not found\u201d or \u201cDuplicate column name\u201d, or more subtly as different output data. As such, it is important to be aware of all of these changes before migrating an existing DataFlow to Magic ETL v2 or before writing a new DataFlow if you are already very familiar with Magic ETL's previous behavior.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-2", "text": "Filter Rows\nNull values are treated differently by the comparison functions. In SQL and Magic ETL v2's DataFlows, the result of any comparison with null is always null, which is treated by the Filter Rows tile like a false result. In most contexts in Magic ETL v2, null is not equal to null, but null is also not not equal to null; null is not greater than zero, but it is also not less than zero, nor is it equal to zero. If you have nulls in columns referenced by Filter Rows tiles, all of those rows will be dropped, regardless of the function or its other argument. The only functions that can deal with nulls truthfully are \u201cis null\u201d and \u201cis not null\u201d. In Magic ETL v1, a filter might have tested \u201ccolumn = null\u201d. This will no longer have the same result; such filters should be changed to use the \u201cis null\u201d operator.\nIf after switching a flow to Magic ETL v2, it runs successfully, but the output seems to be missing rows, this change is a likely culprit. It can be especially surprising with the \u201cis not equal to\u201d function. It might seem like \u201ccolumn <> 5\u201d should only drop rows where column\u2019s value is 5, but in fact it will also drop rows where column is null, for the reason described above. The table below has additional examples of null behavior in Filter Rows.\nTestEvaluated ResultFilter Effect4 <> 5truekeep5 <> 5falsedropnull <> 5nulldropnull = nullnulldropnull <> nullnulldropnull is nulltruekeepnull is not nullfalsedrop5 is not nulltruekeep5 is nullfalsedrop", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-3", "text": "To handle nulls in more complex ways, use the new formula system. The Filter Rows tile is one of three tiles (Group By and Add Formula being the other two) which supports formula evaluation. The IFNULL() function works particularly well for handling a null result from a filter expression. For example, if column \u201ccol\u201d has null values, and we want to filter for rows whose value for \u201ccol\u201d is not 5, preserving our nulls, we could write this expression: IFNULL(col <> 5, TRUE)\nBesides null handling, there are many other scenarios that filter formulas make easier. In Magic ETL v1, the single formula below would have required two separate Filter Rows tiles with multiple conditions each.\nDate and Time Parsing\nWith date and time parsing, the process of converting incoming text into Date or Date & Time values has changed significantly. Generally, it is stricter than it used to be. Some text that parsed successfully in Magic ETL v1 might result in an error in Magic ETL v2. The goal of being stricter is avoiding scenarios where a value is silently misinterpreted, like a month being mixed up with a day. Magic ETL now uses a fixed list of unambiguous date and time formats, plus a locale-specific list of ambiguous formats (e.g. \u201c01/02/2020\u201d is January 2nd in the US and February 1st in most other places). If Magic ETL fails to parse a date, a custom format can now be specified on the Input DataSet tile, on a per-column basis. For information on the format specification, refer to Oracle\u2019s documentation of the Java DateTimeFormatter class.\nDate and Time Operations", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-4", "text": "Date and Time Operations\nDate and time operations in Magic ETL are now performed by default in the company timezone specified in the Domo Admin menu. Magic ETL v1 performed these operations in UTC, the international standard time. This means that a company whose timezone is America/Denver that uses the \u201cMonth of date\u201d operation on a Date & Time column will get the month of that timestamp from Denver\u2019s perspective, not that of Greenwich (UTC).\nThe WEEK_OF_YEAR() function in the Date Operations tile is also now different. Week 1 is the first week with a Sunday in the year. This differs from previous versions of Magic ETL and Beast Mode, where week 1 is the first partial week.\nUsing the Add Formula tile, week behavior can be adjusted: the WEEK() function accepts a second argument: an integer from 0 to 7, representing the \u201cweek mode\u201d to use when calculating the week of a date. These modes are described in Oracle\u2019s MySQL documentation, and are reflected in the behavior of Beast Mode. Mode 0 (or WEEK() without the mode argument) yields the same result as the WEEK_OF_YEAR() function in the Date Operations tile.\nJoins\nThere are two major changes to the Join Data tile:\nIt is no longer important to ensure that the table with fewer duplicate join keys is on the left of the join. The issue in Magic ETL manifesting as the error, \u201cThe left input cannot include over 10,000 duplicates\u201d, has been eliminated.Name conflicts are no longer resolved without user input. Instead, we have added a section to the Join Data tile\u2019s configuration for describing name conflict resolution. This section can be filled out automatically or manually. In addition to renaming conflicting columns, it is now possible to remove them in the Join Data tile\u2019s configuration as well.\nAppend Rows (Union)", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-5", "text": "Append Rows (Union)\nPreviously, when two or more columns going into an Append Rows tile had the same names but different data types, they would not be combined. Instead, two or more new columns would be created, with names like \u201cID Whole Number\u201d and \u201cID Text\u201d. Now, the Append Rows tile never changes column names. Columns that have different types will have their data converted to the best type possible given the types of all the columns that share a name. For example, if one column had type Whole Number, while another had type Decimal, the columns would be combined into a column with type Decimal. In cases where the types are wholly incompatible, like Dates and Decimals, the resulting column will be Text type. This behavior can be replaced with stricter behavior using a new option in the Append Rows tile configuration. The stricter behavior is to throw an error (i.e. fail the execution) if two columns with the same names have different types.\nOther Considerations\nBeyond understanding behavior changes in Magic ETL, it is valuable to learn about the increased transform functionality. Those familiar with the previous version of Magic ETL should be sure to try out the following:\nThe new Add Formula tile\u2014which supports over 200 functions, most of which are unique to the new Magic ETL. When using Add Formula for the first time, be sure to expand the formula editor and browse the function list.The Input DataSet tile\u2014which now supports changing the type of incoming columns, as well as configuring how errors and nulls should be handled. If you want to interpret all nulls in a Text column as the Empty String instead, you can now do so.The new Dynamic Unpivot tile\u2014which makes more sense in some scenarios than the older Unpivot (Collapse Columns) tile. If you want to pivot all columns except a few, rather than pivoting a few columns and leaving most alone, consider using this new tile.\nThis video details the behavior changes.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-6", "text": "This video details the behavior changes.\nVideo - Upgrading Magic ETL", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-7", "text": "Feature Updates\n\nPerformance\nFaster Runtimes\nMagic ETL is now much more performant than the previous version. While each DataFlow's performance changes may vary, most DataFlows will run significantly faster simply by upgrading to the new version. For detailed instructions on how to do this, see Upgrading Magic ETL. We have even found that Magic ETL now often outperforms many MySQL and RedShift DataFlows.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Please be aware of the behavior changes in Magic ETL v2 if you choose to switch your Dataflows back to Magic ETL v1.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-8", "text": "DataSet Views as Inputs\nDataSet Views can now be used as inputs in Magic ETL. This allows for easier filtering, aggregating, renaming, or dropping columns, and performs Beast Mode functions prior to bringing your data into Magic ETL. Try filtering out all unnecessary rows before bringing your data into Magic ETL for reduced runtimes.\nAppend Processing\nOne of the limitations of the previous version of Magic ETL is that at every DataFlow run, the engine loads all of the input DataSet's data, every time, even if that data is unnecessary for the transformations taking place. Now at the start of each run, the system reviews the state of the DataFlow's inputs and outputs. Where possible, only new rows added to the inputs since the last DataFlow execution will be processed during that DataFlow execution. Those rows will then be auto-appended to the output DataSet(s) resulting in the exact same output data but in a dramatically reduced runtime. To learn more about this optimization, see New Magic ETL DataFlow Auto Append Processing.\nNew/Updated Tiles\nNew Tiles\nAdd Formula\nIf you're a SQL power user, transitioning to the previous version of Magic ETL often felt clunky. At times, what took one line of MySQL code could take 15+ mouse clicks in Magic ETL. With the Add Formula tile, that frustration is no more. The Add Formula tile is a row-by-row expression evaluator that allows you to write SQL-style syntax directly into your Magic ETL DataFlow. Create and modify your columns with compounded expressions. Case statements, statistical utility functions, and time-value-money operations are all easily accomplishable with this new tile.\nAlter Columns\nThe Alter Columns tile is an upgraded version of the Set Column Type tile. Now you can easily rename, remove, or change the data types of your columns in one simple tile.\nDynamic Unpivot", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-9", "text": "Dynamic Unpivot\nThis new tile is the inverse of the Unpivot tile. If you expect your schema on an input DataSet to change, using the Dynamic Unpivot tile allows you to narrow a table by pivoting all column data except those columns specified into new rows. Any columns now excluded in the configuration will become row values.\nUpdated Tiles\nGroup By\nOne important distinction you need to consider when using the Formula Tile is \"What type of transformation am I trying to perform?\" If the answer involves aggregations in any way, then you should look to the Group By tile which now supports SQL-style expressions with formula support. The Add Formula tile performs row-by-row operations which does not support aggregations. If you want to use operations like SUM, MEDIAN, or PERCENTILE, then be sure to select the Group By tile to aggregate your data.\nFilter Rows\nThe Filter Rows tile now supports SQL-style expressions as well. Previously, performing a compound filter statement required multiple mouse clicks. In the updated Magic ETL, complex filter rules are quickly configurable with this expression evaluator. For more information on how to write filter formulas, see How to Write a Filter Formula in Magic ETL.\nPivot & Unpivot\nWhat was the Uncollapse Columns tile is now the Pivot tile. What was the Collapse Columns tile is now the Unpivot tile.\u00a0\nJoin Data\nHistorically, column name collisions were difficult to handle when joining data. Now, the Join Data tile enables you to easily specify what should happen when duplicate columns names occur. With easy column name conflict resolution and drop columns options, the Join Data tile has never been easier.\nPython & R Scripting\nScripting tiles are now much more flexible. Specifying a schema for your output DataSet is now optional. Executing your script provides the needed schema for your output DataSet, saving you time. You can run a preview to generate the schema or specify it when you need it as part of downstream tiles.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "6cb9945e45d9-10", "text": "User Interface\nColor-Coded, Curved Lines\nPreviously, complex ETLs were difficult to follow and understand by viewing the graph alone.

You can change them using the color picker.\nNotes on Tiles\nHave you ever come across a complex Magic ETL DataFlow you did not create or that has been running untouched for months? Deciphering what transformations are taking place or even why can sometimes be difficult. With annotate functionality on individual tiles, you can write detailed explanations regarding what the DataFlow is doing on every tile.\nNew Tile Categorizations\nFinding the specific tile you needed in the old Magic ETL could be difficult given that the drop-down categories were limited to DataSets, Edit Columns, Edit Data, and Combine Data. The new Magic ETL has much more detailed categorization: Text, Dates and Numbers, Utility, Filter, Combine Data, Aggregate, and Pivot. The tile tooltips have also been updated to reflect exactly what's new about each tile.\nSelectable text in Data Previews\nEasily interact with the preview data in a Magic ETL DataFlow with selectable text. Now you can quickly copy and paste individual cells or a group of cells from the Preview or Data tabs.\nAdvanced Options\nEnhancements to data type handling\nThe inclusion of formulas makes Magic ETL a more versatile tool.

For example, the marketing page would require a marketing collection on the enterprise page with total reach, impressions, spend, leads, etc., with a subpage with collections for each channel, such as inbound, outbound, display, owned, and earned, with all collections reflecting the KPIs for that dimension. The department page should contain a similar logic, with drilldown options that offer the end user further detail about those metrics.You would classify the departmental views based on your audience; these views could be contained in a page, a subpage, or a collection. It is up to your discretion how best to organize that departmental data based on how the department is consuming these data. For instance, at a CEO level, you would provide the enterprise view, and each department would be a collection within that page. Then, you\u2019d likely have a subpage per department in which the executive staff is tracking the drivers for that data. Then, each executive staff member would have his/her own Departmental Page (for their \u201centerprise\u201d) with the tighter details for their department.

Alerts enable the recipient to quickly access the data, quickly take action in relation to specific business events, and lead them to use Buzz as a collaboration tool to enact or discuss those decisions.Cards should be simple enough to understand within 10-20 seconds.

We encourage using conditional formatting tools to give users visual indicators that help them quickly interpret what they see. Examples of conditional formatting are goal lines or goal achievement color changes, which you can apply using Beast Mode calculations.Every Domo user has the ability to arrange cards and collections on a page into a custom view that makes the most sense to them. However, page owners may want to prevent rearranging to provide a standardized view for all users. In this case, page owners can lock a page to maintain layout consistency for everyone across the page.Page filtering is best used to simplify and focus dashboards on data that matters most for the end user (see Figure 3.

Identify which real outcome you\u2019re trying to impact. Most likely, that will take more than one DataSet to answer. Thus, you shouldn\u2019t limit your dashboard simply by not thinking across DataSets. The best tracking method typically requires multiple DataSets.  For example, you could track your campaign effectiveness three ways: 1) Good: \u201cLeads by Campaign\u201d; 2) Better: \u201cRevenue by Campaign\u201d; 3) Best: \u201cROI or Profitability by Campaign.\u201d Also, remember that your current access to data should not limit the creativity of which metrics you should be using or plan to use to run your business successfully.

This involves helping your Domo users focus on the data and events that are most pertinent to them and only when attention is needed.\nSame card, but unique views of data", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_designing_and_structuring_your_domo_instance/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Designing and Structuring Your Domo Instance"}, {"objectID": "ec588a3f541b-13", "text": "Same card, but unique views of data\nFor many businesses, it is helpful to try to create a page that can be viewed by someone at the top of the organization all the way to the bottom of the organization. For example, in a marketing company, you could build a page pertinent to the CMO down to the marketing analyst. This way everyone is involved in marketing decisions and is able to use the same page. You would want to use Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)\u00a0 to have your marketing analyst go to that same page\u2014looking at the same page as the CMO, but seeing the content within their role and data.\nYou can use PDP filtering to allow individuals in an organization to see how he or she is impacting the goal on a specific card. Creating cards like this can align everyone on the common vision and common metrics of the organization. For example, one individual consultant might look at the same card as a senior-level manager, but both will see a unique visualization of the data; in either case, however, the card will convey their own individual impact on the organization. PDP essentially enables you to set different policies for data access to unique individuals or groups.\nAs you implement a PDP strategy, just note that creating PDP policies that allow users to manage by exception requires that you thoroughly think through your data and who needs access to what.\nAudit card collection\nAnother helpful component you can add to your dashboard is an Audit card collection. This collection can be designed to help users manage by exception in a way often not considered. We recommend having your fourth or fifth card collection on a page include these audit cards. So what is an audit card?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_designing_and_structuring_your_domo_instance/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Designing and Structuring Your Domo Instance"}, {"objectID": "ec588a3f541b-14", "text": "The idea behind an audit card collection is to have a set of cards tied to actionable metrics where the ideal status is zero. For example, if my position in an company involves managing customer service requests, my goal is to have these requests all resolved. An audit card could tell me when I\u2019ve reached 0 outstanding requests for service and alert me when it goes above 0.\nAs for how the card is designed, the summary number for that audit card should reads \u201c0\u201d if no action is required. If there is any number other than 0 in the summary number, the user of the card needs to take action to try to get that metric back to 0 (see Figure 5. Audit Card Collection). PDP can also be applied in this case to ensure, for example, that a team lead\u2019s view of an audit card only applies to her own accounts vs. the accounts of her team.\nIn addition, you can set up alerts based on the summary numbers of these audit cards. These alerts can be designed to update users each time the summary number for a card goes above 0. Again, this makes it so the user only needs pay attention to the audit cards when an event has been triggered and when their personal action is required.\nAlong with setting up audit cards, you may need to have someone on the team who is responsible for the audit card collection who is tasked with \u201cenforcing\u201d actions that need be taken based on data showing in that collection.\nFigure 5. Audit Card Collection", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_designing_and_structuring_your_domo_instance/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Designing and Structuring Your Domo Instance"}, {"objectID": "ec588a3f541b-15", "text": "PDP on every DataSet\nWith PDP, you may want to consider setting up a PDP policy on every DataSet in order to augment and enable a manage-by-exception strategy. Here are the several key advantages of taking this step:\nYou can control access so that even if people share the card or the page, the recipient of the shared content will not be able to see the data unless they\u2019ve been added to the PDP policy. This helps you make sure sensitive data stays in the right hands.PDP policies customize the view for each individual or team and give them specific data relevant to their role. An executive or a sales rep using the same card each have access only to the data appropriate to their role.With PDP, you can upload sensitive HR data and immediately put a PDP policy on it to restrict it to a very limited number of people. This adds an extra layer of protection to your data security strategy.\nAlternative approach\nIt might be nice to say that all of your Domo users should access all the data they need from one page with itemized PDP policies filtering the appropriate data for each role and individual. However, in many cases, it is more effective to structure views or pages according to specific roles\u2014such as an executive view, a team management view, and an individual view. In this scenario, you can create three different DataSets so managers or team leads can view dashboards or cards from the perspective of team members or individuals on that team using a filter.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_designing_and_structuring_your_domo_instance/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Designing and Structuring Your Domo Instance"}, {"objectID": "ec588a3f541b-16", "text": "Without PDP, you would have to know all field names necessary to filter on in order to access these individualized views of the data. With PDP applied to these different DataSets, you can have the filters established from the start. PDP allows you to select the specific data columns you want to see. This is much more intuitive for executives who don\u2019t want to have to search through myriad filtering options. PDP enables the executive to just check the box for what they want to see and then access that view immediately.\nSome caveats\nWhile PDP offers all sorts of advantages for enabling management by exception, there are some limitations and circumstances to consider as you incorporate PDP policies into your dashboards strategy:\nPDP works well if you have 100 or fewer users within a given group. However, if you have more than 100 persons within a defined group, it becomes difficult to maintain those groups, which then makes it more difficult to ensure all users have the appropriate level of access to data.If some of your cards involve concatenated summary numbers, it is more difficult to set up an alert based on this type of summary number. The solution is to create a separate collection of cards that includes copies of the cards with concatenated summary numbers, except that these copies are set up to enable alerts for that card. Essentially, what you may need to set up is a card or card collection that enables better storytelling for the viewer and then a copy of that card or collection that is purely designed to trigger specific alerts.\nFor more information, see the following Knowledge Base articles:\nPersonalized Data Permissions (PDP)Creating and Managing Card CollectionsConfiguring Your Chart Summary NumberNotifications and Alerts\nSummary\nIn summary, all dashboards should be user-driven\u2014who will use it, where they will use it, what they will use it for.

That said, there are some specific practices that will help you avoid errors, organizational issues, and files or project management woes.\nNaming Apps\nFirst, when you create a new app project, remember that you will not be able to add symbols such as colons or dashes in the title. Second, you may want to add a version number to your app title (v1, v2, etc.). This can help you ensure you and other course editors are aware of the most recent version of a course you\u2019re building, especially when you\u2019re sharing app projects with each other.\nNaming Pages\nThe page name that you enter when you first create a page in CourseBuilder is what shows up in the navigation menu. The title in this case should be short and clear. The title that you actually add on the page, however, can be longer and more descriptive. For example, I might name the page \u201cIntroduction,\u201d but give the Introduction page the following title: \u201cWelcome to Onboarding: Phase 1.\u201d In page titles, you can also use symbols like colons and dashes without it having an adverse effect on file integrity.\nNaming Files", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_using_coursebuilder/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Using CourseBuilder"}, {"objectID": "5a195115a1af-1", "text": "Naming Files\nCourseBuilder will automatically strip out disallowed elements of a file name when it\u2019s imported. For example, if you use a \"&\"\u00a0or have spaces in your file name, these will be removed or replaced with an allowed symbol. In any case, you likely want the files you\u2019ve imported into an app to have the same file names that exist in your own media library. That\u2019s why we recommend employing file naming practices where you avoid symbols in general and use underscores instead of spaces. In addition, we recommend adding version names (v1, v2, etc.) to your files as well so, for example, you can keep track of which graphics in your app are outdated. It might also be a good idea to add your initials so other users can track down who created visual assets.\nDeleting Files Not in Use\nIf you have added image or video files to app project that are no\u00a0longer being used, it\u2019s best practices to go through and delete those images or videos in order to reduce the size of your app when it gets published.\nDuplicating Projects to Save Time\nIf you are going to be creating multiple courses or training modules, and those modules require a lot of the same graphic assets or similar page types, structure, or activities, it may save you some time to simply duplicate an app you\u2019ve already created and then rename it. At that point, you can modify or delete elements of the copied app. This can help you avoid having to start from scratch.\nArrangement of Pinpoints\nWhen adding pins to the Pinpoint page, it\u2019s important to note a couple of constraints. For example, if you\u00a0change the background image for the Pinpoint page and the pins are no longer sitting in the best location, move those pins back to the appropriate spot rather than deleting the pins and starting over.\nSizing of Apps, Videos, and Images", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_using_coursebuilder/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Using CourseBuilder"}, {"objectID": "5a195115a1af-2", "text": "Sizing of Apps, Videos, and Images\nWe anticipate that most users won\u2019t be required to have expertise in graphic use in order to successfully deploy images and videos in CourseBuilder because\u00a0it auto-scales these so that they fit within defined parameters.

We\u2019ve designed the pages with this principle in mind: \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Where possible, try to minimize the amount of text on each page and either replace it with an asset you can show (video, infographic, etc.) or employ microlearning strategy by breaking out content into bite-size chunks.  In addition, because most of the page types in CourseBuilder were designed with this strategy in mind, adding too much text will either make pages and activities look awkward, or, at worst, break the functionality of the page itself. For example, page titles should usually be one line. With body text, you have some more flexibility, depending on the page type, but you should still try to keep body text on each page between 1-3 lines, 5-6 lines at most, and rarely more than 6. In fact, depending on the font size you choose, if you add more than 4 lines of text to some pages, you may push activity elements off of the page altogether.\nIn addition, here are some other specific missteps to avoid:\nDon\u2019t just shrink font size in order to fit more text on the page. Let your learning goals control your page design rather than compressing the content delivery experience.Avoid liberal bolding, italicizing, underlining, or changing the color of the body text. Use these features to draw attention to text sparingly, which will help the user maintain focus.If you\u2019re asking the user to take steps, it\u2019s best to avoid paragraphs. Rather, list these out into numbered steps, especially if they\u2019re supposed to follow these steps in sequence. When appropriate, it\u2019s good to accompany instructions with a visual walkthrough.\nQuizzes", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/best_practices_for_using_coursebuilder/index.html", "title": "Best Practices for Using CourseBuilder"}, {"objectID": "5a195115a1af-10", "text": "Quizzes\u00a0\nThe quiz template has a number of different options for you to use. You\u2019ll want to think through the quiz setup and consider whether or not you want learners to have multiple tries answering a question, the type of feedback you want to provide them, and the overall feedback text for correct and incorrect text. If your goal is to teach learners rather than just know when they answer a question incorrectly, consider providing feedback that tells the user what they should have selected and why in addition to whether they answered correctly.\nIn addition, some of the quiz options offer limited space for text, so your quiz questions, answers, and feedback need to be concisely crafted. The list quiz types are better suited for longer questions and longer answers. Also, if the question only has one correct answer, it\u2019s best to use either the square text box answer option or the radio button option.\nTask Design\nIf you want to create step-by-step activities for your users in the Task Box page, it\u2019s best to provide an overview of what the task will entail in the initial task title or description. In addition, be sure to list out steps of a task one by one, rather than including multiple steps in one paragraph. It\u2019s also a good idea to include visuals that either show the process involved in the task or at least what the end product should look like after they\u2019ve completed that task.\nPage or App Flow\nWhen outlining your app, it\u2019s important to go through and determine the types of activities and templates that you are using.

Keep in mind, however, that you currently cannot preview link functionality until the app is published to Domo.\nIn addition, if you export an editable app so someone else can upload it to their CourseBuilder program, do not change the name of the app project folder after you export it. This will break the file mapping within the app and prevent the other user from being able to open and edit that app.\nImporting Apps\nIf another CourseBuilder user shares an app project folder with you and you want to upload it into your CourseBuilder tool, do not change the name of the folder before you import it.

You can choose to display calendar data for an entire year, for a month, or for a single day.\nA calendar requires two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one contains the dates and the other contains the\u00a0number of category items\u00a0corresponding to\u00a0each date.\u00a0You can also include an optional values column.\u00a0The background color for a date determines how many items are associated with the date, or, if a values column is present, the amount for each date. If there are multiple instances of a certain date, the amounts for the date are summed. For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nBy default, Domo uses the\u00a0Auto\u00a0view to display your calendar, which depends on the breadth of data in the DataSet. If the data in your DataSet spans multiple months, the calendar automatically shows data in the\u00a0Year\u00a0view. If the data in the DataSet spans a few days or weeks within the same month, the calendar automatically shows data in the\u00a0Month\u00a0view. You can change this default auto view behavior in\u00a0Chart Properties. For example, if your DataSet contained data for a year, you could tell Domo to show data for a single month by selecting\u00a0View > Month\u00a0in\u00a0Chart Properties. Or, if your DataSet contained data for multiple years, you could indicate the desired year in\u00a0Chart Properties. You can also show the data in a Week view and can indicate the day that starts the week (such as Monday).\u00a0For more information about the options available in\u00a0Chart Properties, see\u00a0Customizing calendars.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/calendar/index.html", "title": "Calendar"}, {"objectID": "a205093951e1-1", "text": "Important:\u00a0For your calendar to work properly, you must set the date grain to Day.

These charts are similar to\u00a0high-low charts\u00a0but are more complex, requiring two additional columns. For any given category, a graphic is shown consisting of a box with lines protruding from the top and bottom, hence the name \"candlestick.\" As in a high-low chart, the ends of the lines represent the high and low prices for the stock respectively. The top and bottom boundaries of the box represent the opening and closing prices of the stock. If the opening price of the stock is\u00a0lower\u00a0than the closing price (that is, the stock gained value), the graphic appears green. If the opening price is\u00a0higher\u00a0than the closing price (that is, the stock decreased in value), the graphic appears red.\nPowering candlestick charts\nCandlestick charts require five columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a category column or row containing the name of each stock or the dates if you are showing a time progression for a single stock; and four columns or rows with the values. One of the columns or rows contains low values for the stocks or dates; one contains closing values; one contains opening values; and one contains high values. For information about value, category, and series data, see\u00a0Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your candlestick chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nFor more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\u00a0KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.\nThe following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a candlestick chart:\n\nCustomizing candlestick charts\nYou can customize the appearance of a candlestick chart by editing its\u00a0Chart Properties. For information about all chart properties, see\u00a0Chart Properties.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/candlestick_chart/index.html", "title": "Candlestick Chart"}, {"objectID": "c163f741f36d-0", "text": "Title\n\nCard Building FAQs\n\nArticle Body", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/card_building_faqs/index.html", "title": "Card Building FAQs"}, {"objectID": "c163f741f36d-1", "text": "Intro\nFind answers to frequently asked questions about the Analyzer here.\nWhat is the difference between the \"Sum\" and \"Count\" aggregation types?\n\"Sum\" adds together all of the values in a DataSet column to yield a total of those values, whereas\u00a0\"Count\" merely counts the number of items in a column and presents that number as a total. A \"Count\" aggregation can be applied to a column\u00a0of\u00a0any\u00a0data type\u2014value, string, or date. A \"Sum\" aggregation, however, can only be applied to a value column.\u00a0\nFor example, in the following DataSet, the \"Invoice\" and \"Cust\" columns have the \"Count\" aggregation applied. This value is \"11\" because there are 11 rows of data in the DataSet. The \"Amount\" column has the \"Sum\" aggregation applied. This value is \"2,071,998\" because this is the total of all of the values in this column.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information about data types, see\u00a0Aggregating your data.\u00a0\nWhat are the DataSet\u00a0row limits for each chart type?\nBox Plots and Histograms have a pre-set limit of 100,000 rows of data. Other chart types have a pre-set limit of 25,000 rows (although the charting engine may limit the data further depending on how many series are represented). You can now use the Limit Rows command inside of the Analyzer to set values larger than would otherwise be possible. To keep the responsiveness fast on your Dashboards, the chart engine limits the number of rows it downloads to the browser. Now you can override these limits by explicitly setting these values.\nWhat are the optimal summary number aggregations for each chart type?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/card_building_faqs/index.html", "title": "Card Building FAQs"}, {"objectID": "c163f741f36d-2", "text": "What are the optimal summary number aggregations for each chart type?\nWhen configuring the summary number for a chart,\u00a0remember that certain aggregations are more appropriate for some chart types than others. For example,\u00a0the \"Current\" aggregation is most appropriate for chart types with a trendline. Using this aggregation with other chart types may not make much sense. A full list of chart types and the appropriate summary number aggregations for each is provided here: Summary number best practices.\nHow do I include multiple targets in a chart?\nThere are a number of ways to include multiple targets in one chart. For example, you may have a Stacked Bar graph with multiple regions and you want each region to have its own target. \nHere are some ways in which you can include multiple targets in a chart:\nUse a \u201cBullet graph.\u201d\u00a0A Bullet graph allows you to set targets for each individual category. For more information, see\u00a0Bullet Graph.Use a \u201cGrouped Bar with Symbol\u201d graph and make the symbol values the target for each bar. To do this, you must have a column with the targets set for each region.\u00a0For more information about this chart type, see\u00a0Grouped Bar with Line Graph.Set the targets in a DataFlow. In this way you can compare revenue, sales, etc., with the targets provided in your own data, so that the targets can be a part of the graph. For more information about DataFlows, see\u00a0Prepare.Use Beast Mode to set the thresholds. For example, if your chart includes a rate line that should never fall below 5% or go above 10%, you could create the following Beast Mode calculations and then add these as a series to your chart:Name: Upper Limit. Calc: AVG(.1)Name: Lower Limit. Calc: AVG(.05)\nHow do I change the name of a column?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/card_building_faqs/index.html", "title": "Card Building FAQs"}, {"objectID": "c163f741f36d-3", "text": "How do I change the name of a column?\nSometimes when the\u00a0naming convention in the DataSet has changed,\u00a0the column will no longer exists.

Here you can select the type of calculation for the marker (in the\u00a0Value Type\u00a0menu), add text if desired, and configure various other options. For more information, see\u00a0Adding Scale Markers to Your Chart.\nIs it possible to show a total of all rows in a chart?\nYou can do this using a Sumo table, as shown in the following example:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/card_building_faqs/index.html", "title": "Card Building FAQs"}, {"objectID": "c163f741f36d-5", "text": "For more information about building Sumo tables, see\u00a0Adding a Sumo Card.\nWhy are lines disappearing in my Line graph when I change the date grain?\nThis most likely involves Outlier Filters that have been set on the graph. When using Outlier Filters, keep in mind that if the date grain of your Line graph\u00a0changes, this could also change the values that are above or below the threshold(s) you have set, resulting in lines disappearing unexpectedly. For example, let's say\u00a0you had a Line graph with a weekly date grain and you set the\u00a0Show When Points Above\u00a0property to\u00a0500. Let's also say the line in the graph has several points exceeding 500. Because there are points above the threshold, the line appears. Let's next say you go back into Analyzer and change the date grain to daily. This causes the individual values on the line to fall below the threshold of 500 (because they are no longer aggregated into weekly values). Thus, the line disappears.\u00a0\nFor more information about Outlier Filters, see\u00a0Filtering Outliers in a Line Graph.\nWhy can't I see dates prior to 1990 in my card?\nKPI charts, which have a date range and grain selected, will not display dates prior to 1990. If you have a business need to see dates prior to this time, please contact your Customer Success Manager to discuss options specific to your instance.\nWhy is my `Date` Quick Filter not filtering correctly?\nWhen using columns named 'Year' or 'Date', the card can become confused because those are also SQL functions which Domo uses to query DataSets for cards. Therefore, the card engine sometimes is unsure whether to use the column name or call the SQL function. We recommend using more specific column names.

If the level of the bars do not remain uniform and instead continue to increase, you need to re-address the scope of your iteration.Identify bottlenecks: Use the rolled-up states of your scheduled work items to determine if there are trends that indicate bottlenecks.
