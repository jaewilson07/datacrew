You need an easier way to configure how each person accesses only the appropriate data.\u00a0Dynamic PDP makes your job easier. Instead of selecting individual values in specific columns to pertain to users or groups, you select a column and\u00a0a user attribute, and Domo takes care of the rest, only allowing\u00a0people to see the rows that match that user attribute. And because user attributes must be locked by an \"Admin\"-level user before they can be used in a PDP policy, you can feel just as secure as when you use a standard PDP policy.\u00a0\n\nFor more information, see\u00a0Creating and Deleting PDP Policies.\nCustom PDP\u00a0Filters\nFor more precise control over\u00a0the rows used in PDP policies, use custom PDP filters. This allows you to set rules for values that are returned, using general filter conditions such as \"is greater than,\" \"is between,\" \"begins with,\" and so on.

It is different in that it represents values through column width as well as height, making it easier to see differences in the values of different items.\nAs with other kinds of bar charts, both vertical and horizontal versions of Marimekko charts are available. In vertical Marimekko charts, series in categories are \"stacked\" on top of each other; in horizontal Marimekko charts, the series appear side by side.\nBy default the values on the y-axis appear with percent symbols. You can change this behavior in the Chart Properties if you want. For more information, see\u00a0Formatting Values in Your Chart.\nUse Cases\u00a0\nMarimekko charts are often used\u00a0for showing market share snapshots, such as in the following example:\u00a0   \u00a0\nLimitations\nNote that Marimekko\u00a0charts may be hard to read, especially when there are many segments. Also, because segments do not have a common baseline, it can\u00a0be difficult for viewers to make accurate comparisons between segments. Therefore, Marimekko\u00a0charts are usually better for providing\u00a0a more general overview of the data.\nPowering Marimekko charts\nA Marimekko chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Marimekko chart.

In addition to guiding you through longstanding alert-building processes such as configuring alert rules and sharing alerts, the Wizard\u00a0also includes a Custom Message Builder. This new tool allows you to\u00a0customize the message that is sent when an alert is triggered. Instead of having to read a system-generated message that may not always make sense to recipients, you can\u00a0now configure your own templates on a per-alert basis.\u00a0\nWhen you go\u00a0to set up a new alert, you can write your\u00a0own text and incorporate system variables to produce a more human-readable, friendly, and informative alert message, which can provide more context to recipients faster. The result is dynamically-generated messages sent to alert recipients\u00a0that clearly provide information on what the alert is supposed to tell them about, as well as what has triggered the alert.\u00a0Managing by exception and keeping everyone on the same page at the same time just got one notch easier.\nFor more information about creating alerts, see\u00a0Creating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card.\nCustom Charts\nDomo has added support for custom data-driven maps. All you need to do is upload an image and Domo does the rest. You can create any maps pertinent to your business, such as maps for countries not available by default\u00a0in Domo, like this map of Hong Kong:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOr you can build geographical maps divided by region, like this regionalized sales map for the United States:You can even\u00a0build maps of objects like office layouts, assembly lines, production/shipping facilities, or seats on an airplane, like the following:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/may_2018_release_notes/index.html", "title": "May 2018 Release Notes"}, {"objectID": "179f03e54622-1", "text": "All of these maps\u00a0are powered by your own data, so any time your data updates, your maps will update as well.\u00a0\u00a0\nDepending on the complexity of your maps, you may be able to upload maps without having to edit the SVG, or you may need to make code changes, which will most likely require a working knowledge of XML.\u00a0\nFor more information, see\u00a0Adding Custom Charts to Domo.\u00a0\nMicrosoft Word Plugin\nUse the Domo Word plugin to download cards or DataSet data from Domo\u00a0into Microsoft Word.\u00a0This is an excellent way to share your Domo data with others in your company who may not have access to Domo.\u00a0\nUsing this plugin, you can do all of the following:\nImport\u00a0KPI\u00a0cards\u00a0or individual components of KPI cards (such as chart/table content, summary numbers, owner name, etc.) into Word.Use query tables to import DataSet data as selected fields or as a single value.Highlight the Domo content in your Word document so viewers can recognize it immediately.Refresh the content\u2014if anything has changed in the card or DataSet, it will be \"redownloaded.\"\nUsers with whom you share documents with Domo content do not need to have the plugin installed to edit or view those documents. However, if they want to update the Domo content, they must have the plugin installed.\u00a0\nJust as with Domo's other Microsoft Office plugins, the Word plugin is not available for\u00a0the Mac OS.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/may_2018_release_notes/index.html", "title": "May 2018 Release Notes"}, {"objectID": "179f03e54622-2", "text": "For more information, see\u00a0Using the Domo Word Plugin.\nNLQ Bots\nSometimes\u00a0you\u00a0just want to see single-valued key metrics in the fastest possible way. Domo's new Natural Language Query\u00a0(NLQ) Bots allow you\u00a0to query Domo directly from Buzz to get an answer in a language that everyone can understand.\u00a0To use NLQ Bots, you\u00a0simply install a\u00a0Bot in Buzz, just like an app,\u00a0then query Buzz for information using natural language. Buzz returns a response to the query in natural language too. This enables business leaders to quickly get insights on demand on any platform that supports Buzz. For example, if you had the Shopify\u00a0Bot integrated with your Buzz, you would simply enter\u00a0/shopify\u00a0followed by a question such as \"how many refunds for march?\" Buzz would then generate and display the answer to your question. For any connector with NLQ Bots enabled, you can see several sample questions just by clicking the \"?\" icon next to the\u00a0Command Name\u00a0field.\u00a0\n\nFor more information about Bots, see\u00a0Adding a Bot to Buzz.\nDomoStats\nIntroducing the freedom to explore what is happening in Domo for your company.

Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click here.\n\n\n\n\nIntro\nThere are many reasons to migrate to the newest version of Workbench\u2014bug fixes, performance enhancements and added features, to name a few. Domo Support will always be willing to troubleshoot issues with legacy versions, but we provide our best support when you\u2019re running the latest version. Please consider regularly checking and upgrading to the latest version wherever possible. This will help you receive the best possible experience with Domo Workbench.\nPlease note, before proceeding with any update or migration, that you must back up your jobs. Workbench 2 users can copy the locally-stored XML files. Workbench 3+ users must export each job individually. If there are any issues or errors, you may need backups. If possible, ask your IT department to take a full snapshot or backup of your VM, Server, or PC before doing any upgrade.\u00a0\n\nFinding Your Current Version\n\nYou may be wondering which version you\u2019re using now. You may also be asked by Domo Support to identify the version in order to provide customized support. There should be a blue icon in the system tray. If you hover over that icon, the version will be displayed.\nIf you don\u2019t see the blue icon, try clicking this up arrow first .

Click Save.\nFAQs\nDo I need to migrate to JWT or OAuth\u00a0right away?\nAlthough Adobe has not announced a date when WSSE will completely be retired, we are recommending that customers start planning for a migration to the Adobe Connectors that use JWT or OAuth to authenticate.\u00a0However, the migration will take place only after customer request.\nWhich authentication method should I prefer?\nAdobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see\u00a0Adobe documentation\u00a0for details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. Adobe recommends JWT authentication instead.\u00a0You may use the OAuth authentication\u00a0but you will need to recreate your account every two weeks.\nHow long does it take to migrate DataSets?\nIt usually takes one business day to migrate DataSets.\nWill my DataSets continue to run during the migration? Will my Cards and DataFlows I have built on these DataSets continue to run?\nYes, they will continue to run while they are being migrated. Once they have been migrated to JWT or OAuth, they will stop running until they are associated with the new JWT or OAuth Account.\nWill the update to JWT or OAuth change the functionality of the connector?\nNo, the update will neither add nor remove the functionality of the Connector.\nCan\u2019t Domo update the Account for me on all my DataSets?\nUnfortunately, that is not possible.\nWhat if I don\u2019t migrate my DataSets?\nIf your DataSets still require WSSE authentication by the time WSSE is retired, they will stop being able to authenticate to Adobe.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/migration_from_wsse_to_jwt_and_oauth_authentication_in_the_adobe_analytics_connectors/index.html", "title": "Migration from WSSE to JWT and OAuth authentication in the Adobe Analytics Connectors"}, {"objectID": "b0446d32d80b-7", "text": "I need to use v1.4 of the Adobe Analytics API.

A Multi Radial Progress Gauge is similar to a thermometer that \"fills in\" to show how close the current value is to the goal. This gauge type does not include ranges. A Multi Radial Progress Gauge is similar to a progress bar gauge except that it is circular and shows an exact value rather than a percentage. Other gauge types in Domo include single value gauges, radial gauges, face gauges, and comparative fill gauges.\nPowering Multi Radial Progress Gauges\nA Multi Radial Progress Gauge requires two columns from your DataSet\u2014Item Names that contains the items that will be shown on the chart and the Gauge Value that contains current values. You can also add a third column as the\u00a0Optional Max Value that you intend for your data to achieve. For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIf multiple rows are present in your DataSet, the values in all of the rows are aggregated. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the target value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for \"Team A\" that both had a target value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new target value of 200. Selecting No Aggregation for either the current value or maximum does not currently work.\nUnless you add a column to the Optional Max Value, the maximum value of a Multi Radial Progress Gauge is automatically determined based on the current value. For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Multi Radial Progress Gauge.
