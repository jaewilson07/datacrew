Click\u00a0Connect\u00a0(or select\u00a0Add Account\u00a0if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing GoToMeeting accounts in Domo) to open the GoToMeeting OAuth screen where you can enter your login credentials. Once you have entered valid\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new GoToMeeting DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\u00a0Accounts\u00a0tab in the\u00a0Data Center.

Categories in grouped and stacked bar charts always consist of two bars shown side-by-side, as in a grouped bar chart. When categories contain more than two series, one of these two bars appears as a typical bar, but the other is divided into series segments, as in a stacked bar chart. This may be useful in situations when you want to compare a primary series (such as a series representing sales data for your company headquarters) against several secondary series (such as those series representing sales data for branch offices).\nGrouped and stacked bar charts have both vertical and horizontal subtypes. Another related chart, the grouped and stacked bar with line chart, combines the features of a vertical grouped and stacked bar chart and a Grouped and Stacked Bar with Line Chart.\nBy default, the first bar in any category grouping in a grouped and stacked bar chart appears as a normal, undivided bar, and the second bar in the category grouping is divided into series segments. However, you can change this default behavior in Chart Properties by entering the number of series you want to appear in the first bar.\u00a0\nPowering grouped and stacked bar charts\nA grouped and stacked bar chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values.

Histograms are most often used for statistical analysis.\nUnderstanding\u00a0histograms\nIn a histogram, two axes appear, one on the left side of the graph and one at the bottom.\u00a0One of the\u00a0axes is divided into ranges of values\u00a0called \"bins.\"\u00a0The\u00a0other axis measures the number of items in the DataSet that fall into each bin.\u00a0For each bin, a bar is drawn that represents the number of\u00a0items in the bin. In a vertical\u00a0histogram, the\u00a0axis with the bins appears on the bottom and the axis that measures the items appears on the left. In a horizontal histogram, these axes are\u00a0switched. \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe following\u00a0example shows how a histogram works. This\u00a0histogram\u00a0represents the frequency at which specific height ranges appear in a group of students. The bottom axis shows the complete range of heights in the DataSet, with bins for individual ranges. The left axis measures the number of\u00a0items\u2013in this case,\u00a0students\u2013that fall into each bin.\n\nPowering histograms\nHistograms\u00a0require\u00a0only two\u00a0data columns or rows from your DataSet. One of the columns contains category names, and the other contains the associated values. Note that the category names themselves do not appear in the chart, but are counted and represented numerically. Also, values do not appear as is, but are converted into ranges in your chart. An optimal number of ranges (and hence, bins) is determined automatically, but you can change the default number of bins in Chart Properties, as seen in the section below on Customizing histograms.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote: Histograms\u00a0have a limit of 25,000 rows of data.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/histogram/index.html", "title": "Histogram"}, {"objectID": "58f3be0db9c6-1", "text": "For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your histogram.

The example at right shows one such gap in the 4.9-5.0 data range.
