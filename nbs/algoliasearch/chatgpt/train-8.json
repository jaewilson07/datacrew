You do this by clicking  then selecting the new chart. In contrast to the chart type picker in Card Builder, which only shows icons for each chart type, the Details view chart type picker shows you actual thumbnail versions of each available chart type with your chart data applied. So, for example, if you opened the Details page for the following Vertical Stacked Bar chart...\u00a0\n\u00a0\n...you could then open the chart type picker and selectable thumbnails of your chart, all powered by your chart data, would appear, as follows:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe original chart type for your chart is always shown in the top left corner of the chart type picker with a gray curved arrow. If you want to switch back to that chart type, you can do so quickly by clicking this thumbnail.\nThe chart type picker only displays thumbnails for chart types that are compatible with your data. In the previous example, \"Scatter Plot\" is not suggested as a chart type because Scatter Plots have a different data structure than Vertical Stacked Bars (i.e. two value columns instead of one). If your chart has a chart type not compatible with any other charts (such as a Calendar chart), the\u00a0 icon is grayed out.\nThe new chart type picker is not available for Maps.\nLegend Item Toggle\nIn most chart types with legends (excluding Maps), you can now click on a legend item to hide or show the corresponding data in the chart. Referring to the \"Amusement Park Profits\" example again...\n\n...clicking \"Black Hole Blaster\" item in the legend causes the data for \"Black Hole Blaster\" (represented as dark green bars) to be hidden from the chart.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/january_2017_release_notes/index.html", "title": "January 2017 Release Notes"}, {"objectID": "d8610fad2fff-1", "text": "In addition, the square next to the \"Black Hole Blaster\" legend item turns white to indicate that the item is hidden. You can click it again to show the bars as before.\nYou can also toggle legend items in Pie-type charts. Legend toggling works a bit differently for these charts. In this case, when you click a legend item, it disappears from the legend (there is no empty square to indicate that the item is hidden). However, you can then click the  icon next to the chart to reset it to normal.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: Be aware that if you hide data in a chart by toggling a legend item, it is still hidden when other users go into the Details view; however, they can show it again by clicking that legend item. If you want to hide data from users, you should use PDP instead. \n\n\n\nChart Zoom\nYou can click and drag over a portion of a chart to \"zoom in\" on that portion. This works on most chart types, excluding pie-type charts, maps, gauges, Radar graphs, and a few others.\nReferring to the same example as previously...\u00a0\n...you could click and drag over the bars from \"16\" to \"19,\" and the chart would zoom to show you just the data for those bars, as shown here:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/january_2017_release_notes/index.html", "title": "January 2017 Release Notes"}, {"objectID": "d8610fad2fff-2", "text": "You could then click the  icon next to the chart to zoom back out to the normal version.\nYou can zoom in on a chart in the Card Builder as well as in the Details view.\nQuick Sort\nFor most Bar and Line graphs, you can now quickly change the sort method just by clicking an icon, without having to open the Card Builder. This icon appears when you mouse over either the x- or y-axis of the chart. Five versions of this icon appear in a cycle; clicking any version sorts the graph accordingly, and the icon changes to the next version in the cycle.\u00a0\nThe following table lists and describes the sort methods associated with each version of the icon:\nIconDescriptionSorts the data items in the graph using the default sort (i.e. the same way they were sorted when the graph was created).Sorts the data items in the chart in order of ascending values.Sorts the data items in the chart in order of descending values.Sorts the data items in the chart in ascending alphanumeric category order.Sorts the data items in the chart in descending alphanumeric category order.\nThese sort options are also available for the chart in the Card Builder.\nFor more information about sorting, see Sorting the Data in Your Chart.\nChart Save As\nWhen you make changes to a chart in the Details view (whether by using any of the above features or filtering using the Analyzer tool), you can now save a copy of the edited chart to your Domo. You do this by clicking the  icon in the Details toolbar then selecting Save As. You can then give the new version of the card a new name, enter a description to help viewers understand what has been changed in the card, and select the page in Domo where the new card will reside. Duplicated cards retain all Analyzer, Chart Properties, and date grain selections.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/january_2017_release_notes/index.html", "title": "January 2017 Release Notes"}, {"objectID": "d8610fad2fff-3", "text": "\"Save As\" versions of cards are entirely independent from the original versions.

It does this by taking the current value for the period and comparing it to the previous period. For example, in the following chart, the current month, October, is not yet over, so the user applies the Forecast property.

That is only relevant when an iframe points to a random third-party site where the embedder has no control over the content nor relationship with the other property.Domo Everywhere iframes are safe because you have total control over all content and because we have a secure relationship across systems. Even the most sensitive finance, healthcare, and government organizations trust our identity integrations (https://developer.domo.com/docs/embedded-capabilities/embedded-capabilities), data access policies (https://developer.domo.com/docs/dataset/create-personalized-data-permissions-pdp), and server-side filters (https://developer.domo.com/docs/embed/programmatic-filtering).Ensuring that external users only ever see the data and content you approve is our primary commitment. After we earn your trust (https://www.domo.com/platform/security), the following design options have been our guiding principles as we have expanded beyond embedded cards, dashboards, apps, and even the entire power of the platform.\nCustomizing the appearance\nThe appearance can be customized through the custom layouts, background colors, images, and fonts that you have already used to push the capabilities of Publish to new heights. Fortunately, Embed already had quite a head start here since it has a more direct path to inheriting the experience directly from the instance where it was created. You can see this continuing to develop as we add Page filters and Page exports.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/javascript_vs_iframe_in_embed/index.html", "title": "JavaScript vs iframe in Embed"}, {"objectID": "cd84ec01ecf4-1", "text": "Visualization flexibility is higher than ever with Domo Data Experience (DDX) apps. For the few chart types that Domo does not already support, JavaScript can simply be pasted in-line and details can be edited in the context of the greater layout to avoid having to build everything from scratch.\nAdapting responsively across device types\nResponsive design started as a quick test for a prospect that wanted to embed Dashboards in the Salesforce mobile app. Only a month after we built it, the functionality was really put to the test with the Domo Covid Tracker. 65% of our traffic there was on mobile. It pushed us to move beyond dynamically reformatting the layout to a vertical stack of Cards with the addition of the Mobile layout edit capabilities. We also added a way to dynamically resize the iframe with postmessage to avoid scroll traps. Now embed works reliably on large screens, mobile browsers, and dedicated mobile apps.\nLoading quickly across regions\nLoading quickly becomes an even greater priority when the lag between the host page loading and the embedded content loading becomes the focus of the viewer\u2019s attention. For that reason, we have been obsessing over speed. This has led to a variety of improvements with iframe speed:\nFirst, we started with gzip compression to make the assets as small as possible.Next, we continued by reducing the size of the JavaScript that drives the iframe even before compression.Then, we changed to activate browser caching by default.Finally, we consolidated API calls to avoid duplicate requests when validating columns.\nAll these things result in iframe load times that are significantly faster than they were last year.\nMaintaining compatibility across browsers", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/javascript_vs_iframe_in_embed/index.html", "title": "JavaScript vs iframe in Embed"}, {"objectID": "cd84ec01ecf4-2", "text": "Maintaining compatibility across browsers\nCompatibility across browsers is the final hurdle. This is definitely one to watch as we move from third-party cookies to header-based authentication. For now, Safari is the most strict. They have already started to block third-party cookies. Chrome will follow in the next couple years as Google figures out how to make their ad tracking work without it. In the meantime, it only really impacts Domo embed in a small segment: app embed on Safari. For that, we already have a workaround. The user clicks an \u201caccept cookies\u201d button similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) dialogs that are common on almost every website these days. Fortunately, Card and Dashboard embed (especially when programmatically filtered through the JSON Web Token (JWT)) do not even have to show the \u201caccept cookies\u201d button because the token is based on header authentication.\nWe use JavaScript where it is essential (authentication and context). For authentication, we use JavaScript to drive the server-side personalization at the row level. We recently expanded upon that to even switch DataSets dynamically. For context, we use JavaScript to push filters down from the host Page into the embedded content. Then we also use that same message channel to pull click events from the embedded content back to the host Page. This is very helpful in linking across Pages with and without embedded content.\nAfter that, the only reason to use JavaScript for embed is to define the actual experience. This is where you must make a decision. Do you want the experience to only be editable by those comfortable with coding JavaScript or for everyone familiar with the drag and drop experience of Story layouts? Do you want the updates to be reliant on the release schedule for the web development team or do you need the edits to be immediately applied as soon as someone presses the Save button in Domo? As Stories continue to progress, using iframe allows you to move faster than if you had to rebuild all the interactions from scratch in JavaScript.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/javascript_vs_iframe_in_embed/index.html", "title": "JavaScript vs iframe in Embed"}, {"objectID": "7fa7e61ee3c1-0", "text": "TitleJIRA Cloud ConnectorArticle BodyIntro\nJIRA helps teams to get organized and work together to build incredible products, but product teams are just one part of your organization.

The region that displays for a DataSet is \"zoomed\" in or out depending on the given coordinates. For example, if all of the cities in your DataSet were in Germany, the resulting map would show Germany; likewise, if some cities in the DataSet were in Germany and others were in France, the map would be \"zoomed out\" to show western Europe. Filters you apply to a latitude/longitude map also work this way. For example, if you were in the Details view for a map of the United States and you used Analyzer to show only cities in Washington and California, your map would be updated to show the westmost region of the United States. For more information about applying filters, see\u00a0Adding Filters to Your Chart.\nThis type of map is almost the same as the latitude-longitude route map. The difference is that points in a latitude-longitude route map are connected to form routes. These maps are more complex than standard latitude-longitude maps, requiring seven columns or rows of data.\nFor information about world maps, see U.S. County Map.\nFor information about troubleshooting when an area in your map does not show data but there is data, see Troubleshooting.\nVideo - Map Charts", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/latitudelongitude_map/index.html", "title": "Latitude-Longitude Map"}, {"objectID": "087913668ac3-1", "text": "Understanding latitude-longitude maps\nLatitude-longitude maps require four data columns or rows from your DataSet, though you can add an optional fifth column for series data if you want. One column or row contains the latitudes of the points you want to plot, one contains the longitudes, one contains the values that correspond with each latitude-longitude pairing, and one contains text for the hover label that appears for each point. Maps also include permanent data labels for specific cities. These are not determined by your DataSet\u2014they are included automatically based on the region. For this reason, it is possible your map may include points that do not have data labels. However, all points have hover text.\nValues are represented in your map by varying point sizes, each size of which corresponds to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet and are represented by a legend, which is automatically included beside the map.\nIf you want, you can add an optional fifth column that contains series data, which is represented in the map by varying colors of map points. For example, if the cities in your DataSet were broken down into two different classes, \"A\" and \"B,\" the points within class \"A\" would appear orange by default, and the points within class \"B\" would appear blue. The sums for each series are shown in the map legend. If a user clicks on a point in a latitude-longitude map with series data, the drill table that appears shows all items for that series in the map.

Two value columns are required. The values in one of these columns is applied to the start points of all given connection lines, and the values in the other\u00a0are applied to the end points. In the map, differences in the values of start and end points are represented by the thickness of the lines. For example, if a line started out small at the start point of a line and became bigger, this would indicate that the value became larger. If the opposite scenario were true, this would indicate that the value shrank. If the start and end points were the same, the line would have the same thickness throughout.\nIn other respects, a latitude-longitude route map is the same as a latitude-longitude map. The provided coordinates and applied filters determine the \"zoom\" level of the map. For more information about filters, see Adding Filters to Your Chart.\u00a0You can also have multiple distinct routes by uploading an optional series column.\nFor information about world maps, see U.S. County Map.\nFor information about troubleshooting when an area in your map does not show data but there is data, see Troubleshooting.\nUnderstanding latitude-longitude route maps\nLatitude-longitude route maps require seven data columns or rows from your DataSet, and you can add an optional eighth column for series data if you want.

Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet and are represented by a legend, which is automatically included beside the map. Differences in the values of start and end point pairs are represented by the thickness of the line connecting them. If you only want to show routes between points, without worrying about values, you can do so by ensuring that all of the values in your DataSet are set to 0.\nYou can break down route lines into color categories by adding an optional eighth column that contains series data. Series data is represented in the map by varying colors of groupings. For example, if the routes in your DataSet were broken down into two different classes, \"Group A\" and \"Group B,\" the lines and points for Group A would appear orange by default, and the lines and points for Group B would appear blue. The sums for each series are shown in the map legend.

Because people are familiar with the Excel spreadsheet reporting their organization has been using, one of the first chart types new users select is a Table chart or Table card. Often people will see the Table card and want to replicate the same Excel reports in Domo, but there are a number of different options that may work better to visualize your data and the story you are telling.\nDifferent chart or card options for visualizing your data\nHeat Maps\nHeat Maps allow you to visualize relationships between data categories and draw attention to \"hot spots\" of activity and trends.\u00a0\nSee Heat Maps for more information.\u00a0\n\nBullet charts\nIf you have data you want to show pacing or progress to a goal, you can use a bullet card, which allow you to see clearly how the pacing is trending.\nSee Bullet Graph for more information.\n\nGauge charts\nIf you have visualizations, for example, that show pacing towards goal or budgets, you could also choose to use a gauge chart. For the department details or broken out tasks and activities, you can create filters or drill paths on the card.\nSee Gauge Charts for more information.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/leaving_table_cards_behind_effective_chart_types_for_reporting/index.html", "title": "Leaving Table Cards Behind: Effective Chart Types for Reporting"}, {"objectID": "f09fd3326b48-1", "text": "Gantt charts\nGantt charts can be used to illustrate project schedules, for example, in campaign scheduling systems or project management scheduling.

Is there a trend between numbers? You could utilize a vertical bar plus symbol chart.\nSee Bar Charts for more information.\u00a0\n\nSlicer cards\nYou can use the slicer cards if you want to be able to look through different sections of your Excel data and create cards that allow you to click on a quick filter that immediately pull up a specific segment of your data. You are able to filter on multiple values at once in the Slicer card to show data filtered for various fields.\u00a0\nSee Slicer Card for more information.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPeriod-Over-Period charts\nPeriod-over-period charts allow you to see data for a specified date range compared with data for the same range for another period. If you want to identify week to week or other period over period trends from your data, you could look through the Period over Period chart types and determine which would be best for your data.\nSee Period-over-Period charts for more information.\n\nCreate a custom card app\nUsing the Domo Developer Portal, you can create custom card apps that will specifically tell your data story. One company created their own Stoplight card app-using the green, yellow, red iconic symbol to indicate changes in their data.\nSee the Developer Portal for more information.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/leaving_table_cards_behind_effective_chart_types_for_reporting/index.html", "title": "Leaving Table Cards Behind: Effective Chart Types for Reporting"}, {"objectID": "f09fd3326b48-2", "text": "Take advantage of Domo Chart Properties and tools\nCreate Custom Alerts for your cardsWhen you set an alert on a card, you are notified whenever certain conditions (which you specify) are met (a value going above or below a certain threshold, for example).

For example, you can pull in the columns used in a Beat Mode into a table card and then the result of the Beast Mode at the far right or left. You can spot check your math or logic statements, showing the result side-by-side with the inputs.

Most line charts display lines horizontally\u2014that is, you scroll left or right to follow the lines. In these horizontal charts, category data appears on the horizontal axis (x-axis) and value data appears on the vertical axis (y-axis). Domo also includes several vertical line charts, in which you scroll up or down to follow the lines. In vertical line charts, category data appears on the y-axis and value data appears on the x-axis.\nPowering line charts\nLine charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories (generally dates or times) and one for values. However, you can add series columns to a basic line chart if you want. Adding series data to a line chart may turn it into a multi-line chart or may simply show the two lines side by side, depending on the data.\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nThere are several different sub-types of basic line charts. These are built in the same way as regular line charts but have different features.\nHorizontal symbol lineHorizontal step lineHorizontal curved lineHorizontal curved symbol lineRunning total line (discussed in more detail here)Vertical symbol lineVertical curved lineVertical step lineVertical symbol lineVertical curved symbol line\n\n\n \n\nNote: Symbols are auto-selected based on the series.

For information about all chart properties, see Chart Properties.\u00a0Unique properties of line charts include the following. You can click a thumbnail image to see a larger image.\nPropertyDescriptionExampleGeneral > Show Right ScaleIncludes a second vertical scale in most kinds of multi-line line charts, with or\u00a0without date or time data. This is useful in situations where you\u00a0want to display\u00a0lines with\u00a0vastly different value increments in the same chart. In the example at right, the left scale shows values in increments of $20,000 and the right scale shows values in increments of 2. Because two scales are present, both lines can be interpreted independently on their own scales. If there was only one scale, the $20,000 increments would be used for both lines, so one of the lines would appear flat.\nThis property (and General >  lines on Left Scale) can only be used in line charts with more than one line. All line chart subtypes are compatible except for step line charts.General > Lines on Left ScaleWhen\u00a0Show Right Scale\u00a0is checked, determines how many of the lines in the chart are measured on the left scale. All additional lines are measured on the right scale. If\u00a0Show Right Scale\u00a0is not checked, this property does not work.\u2014General > Sync Zero LinesSyncs the zero lines in dual-scale charts with negative values so the \"0\" values match. For line charts, this works only when General > Show Right Scale is checked.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/line_chart/index.html", "title": "Line Chart"}, {"objectID": "cf96e341bbc2-3", "text": "The first example at right shows a dual-scale chart with scales that do not match. The right-side chart is being used to measure sales, which are always going to be positive; hence the scale starts at 0. However, the left-side scale is being used to measure profit, which may dip below 0. In this case the scale starts at -2000. Because the scales do not match, the chart is difficult to interpret.\nThe second example shows the same chart with the zero lines synced. Even though the other values do not match, the viewer can easily use the zero line as a reference point to interpret the line and bars simultaneously.\nCategory Scale > Never Use Time ScaleDetermines which type of timeline is used in supported charts with time data.\nBy default, when time data is used in supported charts, such as line and bar charts, Domo automatically makes it appear using a date grain appropriate for your data. This is shown in the first example at right, in which the timeline takes date data spanning several months and shows it by month.\nIf you check this box, however, date data appears as it does in your DataSet. This is shown in the second example at right, in which the time scale uses individual dates, as in the DataSet.\nThis option is not available for step line charts.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/line_chart/index.html", "title": "Line Chart"}, {"objectID": "cf96e341bbc2-4", "text": "Grid lines > Remove Min/Max/Avg linesRemoves the minimum, maximum, and average lines that normally display on mouse-over in standard bar and line charts.\u2014Last Value Projection > Project UsingDetermines whether a final value is projected in bar and line charts and, if so, how this value is determined.

Which can help us to predict continuous values and explains objects based on a given set of numerical and categorical data. For example, we can predict house prices based on house attributes such as several rooms, size, and location.\nIn mathematical terms, the regression method provides us a linear line that belongs to the equation of Y = aX+b to model a dataset. Here we are taking the X (Dependent variable) and Y (Independent variable) data points to\u00a0train our linear regression model. The best observation line can be found by calculating the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) values.\nHere, the regression analysis performs with various effective algorithms:\nSimple linear regressionMultiple linear regressionPolynomial linear regressionDecision treeRadom forestSupport Vector machine (SVM)\nApplications\nRisk assessmentScore predictionMarket forecastingWeather forecastingHousing and product price predictionDigital personal Assistance (Siri and YouTube)\nClassification\nClassification is a supervised learning task used when we need a limited set of outcomes. It generally provides predicted output values, which may be \u00a0True or False. \u00a0It performs in the way of two types such as Binomial and Multi-Class. For example, we can find whether a received email is Spam or Not. \u00a0\nHere, we have data points belonging to three different fruits like blueberry, lime, and apple. We can classify them by using machine learning classification techniques. The three fruits are represented by three various related colors such as blue, orange, and yellow respectively. Then, we draw a linear line between them for clear separation and see how they are presented.\u00a0Classification supported Algorithms", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/machine_learning_concepts_to_help_you_be_more_successful/index.html", "title": "Machine Learning Concepts to Help You be More Successful"}, {"objectID": "1ccd222cd87a-1", "text": "Logistic regressionKNN (k-nearest Neighbor)Naive-BaseDiscriminant AnalysisSVM (support vector machine)Decision treeNeural network\nApplications\nImage classificationEmail spam detectionFraudulent detection\nMajor Elements of Model Overview\nThe model overview allows us to asses different model settings using key evaluation metrics. In what follows, we discuss and define each of these concepts.Evaluation Metrics\nAn evaluation metric is a statistic of our model that helps us determine how well it is performing. For example, accuracy is a common and intuitive evaluation metric. Many other evaluation metrics exist, each with its own strength and weakness. The choice of evaluation metric also depends on our task. If we are doing classification, we will choose a different metric than if we are doing regression. For a comprehensive list of evaluation metrics available for AutoML see (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLJobObjective.html).\nFor classification, the default evaluation metric is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic. The basic idea behind the AUC score is that we can measure the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) at all possible classification thresholds. The ideal AUC is 1.0. Additionally, a model that predictably completely at random yields an AUC of 0.5. AUC is best used as a criteria of relative comparison. For example if model x yields a higher AUC than model y we can conclude that model x is more suited for deployment. Other metrics", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/machine_learning_concepts_to_help_you_be_more_successful/index.html", "title": "Machine Learning Concepts to Help You be More Successful"}, {"objectID": "1ccd222cd87a-2", "text": "In the case of regression, the default evaluation metric is Mean Squared Error (MSE). The MSE measures average, squared difference between of values predicted from our model and the ground truth. A perfect model will yield an MSE of 0.0. Thus our goal should be to choose a model that minimizes MSE. For example if model x yields a lower MSE than model y we can conclude that model x is more suited for deployment. Because MSE squares the difference between the predicted and ground truth values, large outliers may cause large increases in the MSE. Therefore, we should take care to ensure that our input data has been carefully preprocessed.\nTrain/Validation Split\nWhen performing machine learning tasks, we typically split our dataset into two partitions: one for training and one for validating. The basic idea behind this split is to hold out some samples from the model to ensure a fair evaluation. It is common practice for a teacher to ask a students different questions during a class than on an exam to evaluate their general understanding of topics. For the same reason, we want to make sure that the data samples used to train and evaluate our models are different.\nWe call this practice the train/validation split. Our training data refers to the data samples used to \u201cteach\u201d our model, while the validation set refers to the samples we use to evaluate. Splitting our data in this ways allows us avoid issues of overfitting.\nOverfitting\nOverfitting refers to \u201cthe production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting].\u201c In other words, a model that is overfit is very unlikely to generalize to unseen data.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/machine_learning_concepts_to_help_you_be_more_successful/index.html", "title": "Machine Learning Concepts to Help You be More Successful"}, {"objectID": "1ccd222cd87a-3", "text": "For example, see the figure below. If we are trying to classify points as belonging to the red or the blue class, we could draw a perfect line (green) around each points. However, if we observe a new set of data the new decision boundary is unlikely to be exactly the same as the green line. Conversely, the black line is much smoother is therefore more likely to generalize.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/machine_learning_concepts_to_help_you_be_more_successful/index.html", "title": "Machine Learning Concepts to Help You be More Successful"}, {"objectID": "1ccd222cd87a-4", "text": "The green line represents an overfitted model and the black line represents a regularized model. While the green line best follows the training data, it is too dependent on that data and it is likely to have a higher error rate on new unseen data, compared to the black line. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting\nWe can diagnose overfitting by comparing using our training and validation datasets. When we have very low training error (i.e., AUC or MSE) but high validation error we are overfitting: our model is effectively memorizing the training data. In the ideal case, the training error and validation error are roughly equal. This implies that our model is properly calibrated and will generalize well.\u00a0\nModel types\nDomo AutoML currently supports two primary model types: LinearLearner and XGBoost.\nLinearLearner: A linear model of the target variable. For example, if we want to predict sales, we decompose sales, yi, as a function of the input columns, xi, such that yi = w1x1 + w2x2 + \u2026 + wkxk. Here, wi refers to the impact of xi on yi and is learned from the data. This model can be used for either regression or classification. In the case of classification, a logistic \u201clink\u201d function is wrapped around the right hand side to transform the predictions into probabilities (i.e., y is between 0 and 1).", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/machine_learning_concepts_to_help_you_be_more_successful/index.html", "title": "Machine Learning Concepts to Help You be More Successful"}, {"objectID": "1ccd222cd87a-5", "text": "XGBoost: XGBoost is a flexible, tree-based model that can be used for either regression or classification. It is an implementation of Gradient Boosted Regression/Classification Trees. The key idea is that we can derive multiple decision trees mapping xi to yi. We can then average over this \u201censemble\u201d of trees to make our final decision. The key difference between the LinearLearner and XGBoost is that the latter can learn non-linear relationships between xi and yi. For more details see (https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/model.html).\nHyperparameters\nOne important use case of the Model Overview page is to view the results of different model setting, or hyperparameters. Nearly every machine learning model has one or more hyperparameters. \u00a0A hyperparameter refers to a setting, or value, of a model that needs to be set by the user, and is not learned from data. The key value of Domo\u2019s AutoML feature is that we automatically allow you to try hundreds of candidate hyperparameter values and choose the one with the best performance.\nThe best candidate is surface on the page in the \u201cBest Candidate\u201d pane, detailing the hyper parameter value, the resulting evaluation metric (e.g., AUC or MSE) and the model type.\nEach model type has different hyperparameters.\nXGBOOST (for more details see https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html)", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/machine_learning_concepts_to_help_you_be_more_successful/index.html", "title": "Machine Learning Concepts to Help You be More Successful"}, {"objectID": "1ccd222cd87a-6", "text": "Alpha: L1 regularization term on weights. This parameter constrains the model to be more conservative. It will also force the effect of unimportant features to be zero.Column Sample by Tree: The fraction of columns to be subsampled for each tree. 1.0 denotes that all of the columns are used in each tree.Eta: Step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting.Gamma: Minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree.Lambda: L2 regularization term on weights. This term constrains the model to be more conservative. Ideally, this can help the model generalize better to unseen data.Subsample: Subsample ratio of the training instances. Setting it to 0.5 means that XGBoost would randomly sample half of the training data prior to growing trees.\nLinearLearner\nL1 Regularization: The strength of the L1 regularization. This parameter constrains the model to be more conservative. It will also force the effect of unimportant features to be zero.Learning Rate: Step size of the optimization algorithm. This value controls how big the each step is as we search for the best model parameters. A learning rate that is too small will cause the training to be very slow. A learning rate that is too large could cause the optimizer to miss best set of parameters.Loss Function: The function use to train the model. Either Logistic or MSE.Mini Batch Size: The the number of data samples collected for each batch. Larger batch sizes generally result in a better estimate of the gradient and can improve performance.Weight Decay: Also called L2 regularization.

At the start of each execution, the system reviews the state of the DataFlow\u2019s inputs and outputs, and for any changes to the DataFlows\u2019 actions. Where possible, only new rows added to inputs since the last DataFlow execution will be processed by the new execution and appended to the output DataSet(s). As explained below, the system automatically identifies situations where all rows must be reprocessed to ensure data integrity. In ideal cases, these optimizations will reduce execution times by orders of magnitude. This article describes how to take full advantage of this feature in your data pipeline.\n\n\n \n\nImportant: There are significant behavioral differences in Magic ETL.

The run time and row counts may also indicate a DataFlow has been optimized. \u00a0For example, if your 10,000 row input DataSet had 100 rows appended to it, an optimized execution might show only 100 rows processed, while an execution where the optimization could not be applied would have shown 10,100 rows processed.\nHow it works\nDataFlow executions are only optimized in this way if the system determines that appending new rows to the existing output DataSet(s) will result in the exact same data as an unoptimized execution. The following behaviors prevent a DataFlow from being optimized. Through understanding the circumstances that cannot be optimized, we hope to help you take advantage of DataFlow optimizations and thus streamline your data pipeline.\nCurrent Date Functions\nAny formula or tile configuration which depends on the current date and time will disable this optimization for all the transforms to which it is connected. Since the current date and time would be different with every execution, it is never possible to ensure that appending to existing output DataSets will be the same as re-executing from scratch. Functions like NOW(), TODAY(), CURDATE(), and the use of the Current Date and Time\u00a0option on the Add Constants and Filter Rows tiles will disable DataFlow optimizations.\nIf a date/time field in the data itself is an acceptable substitute for the current data and time (e.g. _BATCH_LAST_RUN_), use of that field instead will enable the DataFlow optimization.\nAggregation tiles", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_dataflow_auto_append_processing/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL DataFlow Auto Append Processing"}, {"objectID": "76c1c1edcda0-2", "text": "Aggregation tiles\nTiles that do not process data row-by-row, but rather as a complete set, force the DataFlow to load all rows, and thus preventing optimized executions.

The exception is when the aggregation is the \u201clookup\u201d side (non-outer side) of a Join. In that case, as long as the input to the aggregate tile does not change, the Join may still be optimized (see below).\nJoins\nJoins will be optimized when they meet the following criteria:\nInputs to one side of the Join have been appended to, while the other side has stayed the same.The side of the Join that is unchanged (think of it as the lookup table) is not the \u201couter\u201d part of the Join.\nFor example, a Right Join may be optimized if only the right table changes. \u00a0An Inner Join will be optimized in most cases. A Full Outer Join will never be optimized.\nUnion\nUnions may be optimized when all of their inputs have new data appended.

If any cells in the column contain the same value, those cells are given the same ranking number, as in a \"Rank\" function; however, the numbering continues as normal to the next cell (i.e. no \"gap\" appears). For example, if the first three cells in the column had a value of 100 and the next cell had a value of 200 and the values were set to be in ascending order, the first three cells would be ranked \"1\" and the fourth cell would be ranked \"2.\"\nThe following screenshot shows an example of this:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_aggregate/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Aggregate"}, {"objectID": "87f89ea266e6-5", "text": "Because the first three states have the same $ value, all are ranked as 1.

(For an explanation of partitioning, see Understanding Partitions\u00a0at the top of this page.)\nRow Number\nThe Row Number function returns the row numbers of all values in the selected column. Note that when partitioning is used, rows take the number of their row within the partition group, not necessarily the row number of the DataSet. This is shown in the following screenshot, in which the row numbering derived from the Row Number function restarts with each new partition. Thus, beginning with row 4, the derived row numbers are not the same as the DataSet row numbers.\nTo configure the Row Numbers action,", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_aggregate/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Aggregate"}, {"objectID": "87f89ea266e6-6", "text": "To configure the Row Numbers action,\nClick the Rank & Window tile in the canvas.(Optional) Rename the tile by clicking , then entering the name you want.Click Add Function.Add a name for the new column that will contain the ranking results (such as \"Row Number\").In the Select function type menu, select Row Number.Click the Apply button in the top right corner of the dialog.\tThree new steps appear.In Step 2 of the dialog, select the column you want to derive row numbers for.In Step 3 of the dialog, select the order you want the values in the column to be sorted in.(Optional) In Step 4 of the dialog, select the column to use as a partition, if any. (For an explanation of partitioning, see Understanding Partitions\u00a0at the top of this page.)\nFramed Functions\nFramed functions take a mathematical function and apply it to a cell in a column, along with a specified number of cells before it (\"Preceding\") and after it (\"Following\"). The derived values appear in a new column.\u00a0\nThe following simple example shows how this works. For this example, the user has selected the Sum function and has indicated a Preceding value of 1 and a Following value of 2.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_aggregate/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Aggregate"}, {"objectID": "87f89ea266e6-7", "text": "In the example, each value in the \"Original Value\" column is added to the one cell above it and the two cells below it, and the result appears in the same row in the \"Derived Value\" column. So for row 5, 3 is added to 1 (in row 4), 5 (in row 6), and 1 (in row 7). The total, 10, appears in the \"Derived Value\" column in row 5. If there are not enough values above or below a given value to include in the calculation, these are simply omitted. For example, for row 7 there is only one Following value, so the equation simply becomes 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.\nWhen partitioning is applied, partitions are honored in functions. In the following example, the user has selected Sum and indicated a Preceding value of 1 and a Following value of 2, just as in the previous example. However, he also sets the \"Class\" column as a partition.\nBecause of the grouping of rows thanks to the partition, some of the values are summed differently. For example, in row 4, only one Following value is available because the partition separates all \"B\" values into another group. So the equation for this row becomes 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. Likewise, for row 6, only the two Following values are available because of the partition; therefore, 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.\nFor an explanation of partitioning, see Understanding Partitions\u00a0at the top of this page.\nAverage\nThe Average function takes the average of a given cell and its indicated Preceding and Following values.

Offset functions come in two types: the Lag function, in which the values in the new column are offset after the values in the original column, and the Lead function, in which the values in the new column are offset before the values in the original column. In both Lag and Lead functions, partitions are honored.\u00a0\nLag\nIn a Lag function, the values in your new column follow the values in your original column after a specified offset.

Observations in the column are labeled as outliers if the value is greater than a pre-specified number of median absolute deviations (MADs) from the median in either direction.\nStandard Deviation", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_data_science/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Data Science"}, {"objectID": "767d71674e9f-11", "text": "Standard Deviation outlier detection is an anomaly detection algorithm that attempts to detect outlying or unusual observations on a numeric column in a DataSet.

This action is useful only for unpivoting data in which the number of columns stays the same. If you add another column of data to the original file, this action does not unpivot the new column.\nExample\nFor example, the Unpivot tile converts data in this pivoted format...\n\u00a0\n... to data in this format...\n\n... using this configuration:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_pivot/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Pivot"}, {"objectID": "e43676af2016-2", "text": "... using this configuration:\n\nTo configure the Unpivot tile,\nClick the Unpivot\u00a0tile in the canvas.(Optional) Rename the tile by clicking\u00a0, then entering the name you want.Enter the name of the column you want to create to contain the column headings from the columns to unpivot.\tFor example, \"Product\".\u00a0Enter the name of the column you want to create to contain the row values from the columns to be unpivoted.\tFor example, \"Sales\".\u00a0For each column you want to unpivot, do the following:Select a column to normalize.\t\tFor example, \"Product A\".\u00a0Enter a value representing the column header to be normalized.\t\tThe value appears in the row of the new column.

For information on specific tiles, click on any of the following links to jump to the section for that tile:\nPython Package API ReferenceR Package API Reference\nScripting tiles are a powerful tool within Domo's Magic ETL feature. They allow you to write custom R or Python algorithms and implement them\u00a0directly into DataFlows. With this, you can create complex data science analyses that run every time your data updates.\nTake A Tour\nAll scripting tiles have\u00a0the same look. The only difference between them is the supported language.\nThe main body of the tile is the code editor. This is where you\u00a0write your script. It includes\u00a0syntax highlighting for the specific language the tile supports.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_scripting/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Scripting"}, {"objectID": "6956447622fc-1", "text": "On the right side of the tile is a searchable list of input tiles currently connected to the scripting tile. Click on the name of an input to inject a code snippet\u00a0into the script at the location of the cursor. This code snippet will read the data into the script and store it in a variable. Rename the variable to whatever you would like.\n\nThere is a second tab on the right side of the tile called Packages.\u00a0When you click the tab, a searchable list of available packages for the supported language is displayed. Hover over the package name for a description, or click on the arrow that appears to go to the package's documentation website. As\u00a0with inputs, if you click on a package, a code snippet is\u00a0injected into the script at the location of the cursor. This code snippet imports\u00a0the selected library for use in the script.\n\nOn the right side of the tile editor panel toolbar is a template icon button . Clicking this button resets the script to the example code template that exists when you first open a scripting tile. Be careful though\u2014if you have already\u00a0written\u00a0a script, clicking this button overwrites your script (after a confirmation prompt). However, as long as you do not close the tile, you can retrieve your overwritten script by placing the cursor within the code editor and pressing Command+z or CTRL+z.\nIn the Schema tab,\u00a0you tell the tile what the results of your script looks like. To use this, click\u00a0Schema\u00a0in the tile editor panel toolbar. For a deep dive into this tab, see the Populating the Resulting Schema\u00a0section of this documentation.\n\nIn the Console tab, you can see the standard out (stdout) and standard error (stderr) that your script produces.

The API is different for each scripting language and tries to follow the semantics of the language.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNote: Be aware of the following data type issues when using scripting tiles in Domo:\u00a0\nIn Python, LONG becomes DOUBLE in Python because NumPY does not support NULLs in integer columns.In both Python and R, DECIMAL becomes DOUBLE because there is no analogous type in NumPY or R.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/magic_etl_tiles_scripting/index.html", "title": "Magic ETL Tiles: Scripting"}, {"objectID": "6956447622fc-3", "text": "The easiest way to see the specific API calls for your language is to examine the initial code template that is provided in a newly created and connected Scripting tile.\nStep 1: Import\u00a0The Domo Package\nThe first line in any script should be used for importing the language-specific Domo package into the script. This follows standard package import semantics for the chosen language. It is part of the initial code template.\u00a0Alternatively,\u00a0you can search for \"domo\" in the Packages list to the right of the code editor and click on the package to inject the code snippet into the editor.\nStep 2: Read Data Into The Script\nThe next step in writing a script is getting access to the data. Each language will have its own semantic version of a Domo \"read\" method. This is included in the initial code template.\u00a0Alternatively, you can click on one of the inputs in the input list to the right of the code editor. This injects a code snippet that is reading the input data and storing it in a variable. You can rename this variable if you like.\nStep 3: Export Data Out Of The Script\nThe last step in writing a script is returning the results to the Domo ecosystem. Each language has its own semantic version of a Domo \"write\" method. This is also\u00a0included in the initial code template. There is no other way of injecting a code snippet for this, however. Provide the name of the variable that is storing the results of your script to this \"write\" method. There can only be one export per script.\nPopulating The Resulting Schema\nThere are three ways to tell the tile what schema your script produces. These methods can be mixed and matched as necessary to get the proper result.
