Recommended for small, consistent user groups.To implement, purchase user licenses.\nServer-Based \u2014 Uses programmatic server-side filtering. The environment that hosts the Domo embedded content is authenticated against Domo and programmatically determines what Filters to apply. The Filter requests are then sent to Domo when the embedded content is displayed.\nThis option provides the greatest flexibility and works fell for large or transient user groups, but carries a higher technical debt. It requires a developer to create and maintain the programmatic Filters.To implement, purchase impressions (or card loads).\nFor more information, see Embed in the Domo developer docs.\nPlatform-Based \u2014 Supports SSO and PDP. Completely editable experience.This option is easiest to build and deploy full data experiences to your customers using the Domo platform.To implement, purchase a platform package that includes a Domo environment for every customer you want to deliver content to.\nNotes\nFor both public and private user-based embedding, copy the automatically generated HTML string from Domo and paste it into the necessary location on the website, blog, etc. as an iFrame or via a JavaScript API.

Embedded content is then served to the end user via either the Javascript API or iFrames. You can pair private embed with PDP to serve appropriate content to end users, including external end users. If you use embed to serve content to external end users, one of two methods is preferred:\nEmbed cards from a white-labeled subscriber instance. This way, if a savvy end user was to access the Domo application, they would see only a white-labeled instance (e.g. no Buzz functionality).\tTo learn more, see Publishing Content to a Subscriber Organization.Use Programmatic embed. When using Programmatic embed, end users are NOT actually authenticated users of Domo. Thus, end users are not able to access the Domo application. This means the portal or application code handles authentication and ensures end users see the appropriate data.\tFor more information, see Using Programmatic Filters with Domo Embed.\nImplementing Private Embed\n1.

Both tools have their advantages and disadvantages, but let\u2019s start by summarizing the primary use cases for each tool:\nDataFusion: Use when you\u2019re dealing with lots of data (>20 million rows and >25 columns) that needs to be combined (joined or union/append) with other data quickly (for example, daily sales numbers or other data that updates regularly throughout the day).DataFlow: Use when you need to perform a transformation that can\u2019t be accomplished by just combining data and/or leveraging Beast Mode calculations to run the job.\nDataFusion: Advantages and Disadvantages\nBecause a DataFusion is a just a view of the data, the output doesn\u2019t have to be materialized and indexed into the Domo databases, which makes it so that data can be combined, visualized, and updated very quickly in Domo.It makes data transformations fast when you\u2019re working with a lot of data; more specifically, any DataSets with more than 20 million rows and >25 columns of data should be combined using a DataFusion.You can leverage creative Beast Mode calculations within Analyzer to specify which data you want to display and how.You can control naming of columns during initial setup of the DataFusion.You can control which columns to include or exclude at any time.You can only do joins or appends using DataFusion.You cannot use DataFusions as inputs\u00a0for\u00a0DataFlows.You have less backend control over renaming or editing your column names after the initial creation of the DataFusion.\nDataFlow: Advantages and Disadvantages", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/should_i_use_a_datafusion_or_a_dataflow/index.html", "title": "Should I Use a DataFusion or a DataFlow?"}, {"objectID": "67ead43405ec-1", "text": "DataFlow: Advantages and Disadvantages\nDataFlows offer\u00a0much more up front flexibility.

Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.The Simba Spark JDBC Driver is used for direct SQL and HiveQL access to Apache Spark, enabling Business Intelligence (BI), analytics, and reporting on Spark-based data. Use Domo's Simba Spark JDBC connector to efficiently gain direct SQL and HiveQL access to Apache Spark.\nThe Simba Spark JDBC connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from databases using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking Database in the toolbar at the top of the window.\nYou connect to your Simba Spark Server in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Simba Spark JDBC connector user interface.

This chart type is useful when you want to see a single value quickly without having to interpret bars, lines, etc. Other gauge types in Domo include Filled gauges, Progress Bar gauges, Radial gauges, Face gauges, and Comparative Fill gauges.\nPowering Single Value gauges\nA Single Value gauge requires only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one contains categories, and the other contains the values. For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nBy default, all of the values in your values column are summed to produce the final value for the chart, even when you select No Aggregation in the value aggregation menu. This is because the General > Value chart property for this chart type is set to Sum by default. This property performs a second aggregation on the chart value in addition to the one selected in the value aggregation menu.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\u00a0Because having two aggregations in a chart is usually undesirable, select No Aggregation in the value aggregation menu, then select your desired aggregation in the General > Value menu in Chart Properties.\n\n\n\nFor more information about aggregating data, see Aggregating your data.\nFor more information about Chart Properties, see Chart Properties.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Single Value gauge.

The aggregation you select here is added to the aggregation you select in the value aggregation menu (so, for example, if you selected Average in the value aggregation menu and Sum in Chart Properties, your gauge value would be the summed averages for each category).", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/single_value_gauge/index.html", "title": "Single Value Gauge"}, {"objectID": "0d4e48e01c6e-2", "text": "Because having two aggregations in a chart is usually undesirable, select No Aggregation in the value aggregation menu, then select your desired aggregation in the General > Value menu in Chart Properties.\u2014General > Value FormatDetermines the general number format for a Single Value gauge.

This option is useful when the value is very large and you want to abbreviate it by dividing by a common number. For example, if the gauge value represented millions of dollars, you could choose to divide by millions\u2014the gauge value would then be reduced to more comprehendible single digits. When you choose to divide by Percentage, the gauge value is multiplied by 100.\u2014General > Decimal PlacesDetermines the number of decimal places used in the gauge value. You can choose from Default, None, and options for numbers of decimal places (from \".0\" to \".00000\").

When you add them\u00a0to a card page in Domo, users visiting that page can click on\u00a0values to filter the other cards on the page. With Radio Button cards, users can only filter on one value at a time; with Slicer and Checkbox cards, they can filter on multiple values at once.\nFor example, you could build a Slicer card with names of U.S. states and add it to a card page. If you then clicked \"Texas\" and \"Oklahoma,\" all of the cards in the page would be filtered to show only data for those states. Filter cards only work when Interaction Filters are turned on. If Interaction Filters are not turned on, clicking a filter opens the Details view for the card instead of applying the filter.\u00a0For more information about using slicer cards on a card page, see Applying Page-Level Filters -- Slicer, Checkbox, and Radio Button Cards.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\nNote: In order to use a Beast Mode as the column in the \"Items\" section to power your Slicer, Checkbox, or Radio button cards, you must share the Beast Mode to the DataSet.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nYou can also use Slicer, Radio Button, and Checkbox filters in a card Details view to filter data to a specific column value before applying drill path.\u00a0\nSlicer and Checkbox cards are essentially the same.

Write-Back connectors are part of Domo\u2019s Integration Studio suite. More information on setting up Snowflake Write-Back connector can be found here.\nIs there a limit on how many Snowflake Federated accounts and DataSets you can create?\nSpecific limits on accounts and DataSets depend on your account tier. Please contact your CSM or AE for more details.\nWhat is the warehouse sizing guidance for using Domo Federated queries for Snowflake?\nWarehouse sizing depends on how many DataSets, Dashboards, and Visualizations you have in Domo. At a minimum, we recommend a medium sized warehouse (M), and Auto Resume set to ON. For the best Domo and Snowflake experience, we recommend using a Large Snowflake warehouse (L). If you want to Auto suspend your warehouse during periods of inactivity, you can set that as needed.

If you are already using Snowflake as a data warehousing solution, this connector helps you use Domo in conjunction with it to get the most from your data. To use this connector, you must have your Snowflake account name (domain) and the username and private key for your Snowflake account. Use Domo's Snowflake KeyPair Partition connector to maximize your cloud data strategy by connecting your data to Domo and making it instantly accessible to everyone in your company.Once your Snowflake data is in Domo, you can combine it with all your other Domo data to get a centralized view of your most mission-critical data.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to a Snowflake database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe full name of your account (provided by Snowflake).

Use Domo's Snowflake KeyPair Unload connector to unload data from your Snowflake database into Amazon S3. The files are downloaded from S3 into Domo. This connector should be preferred over the Snowflake connector if you are executing very large queries.\nYou connect to your Snowflake account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Snowflake KeyPair Unload\u00a0Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to a Snowflake database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe full name of your account (provided by Snowflake).

For more information, see the next section.\nMany types of bar charts allow you to apply two additional category/series-based sorts using Chart Properties. These sorts are as follows:\nSort on Totals. When you select this option for a multi-series bar chart, categories are sorted by the totals of all of their series, regardless of the ranking of the individual series. In the following example, the category with the highest total was \"Customer Service,\" even though several departments had higher values for \"Voluntary Resignation\":Sort Each Category.

Most often, they are represented as a date such as 'MM-DD-YYYY'. However, they can also be visualized as a string, such as 'January' if you are showing data by month.

Therefore, the height of the entire stack represents the total of all series in that category. A horizontal Stacked Bar is almost the same as a vertical Stacked Bar, but the series appear side by side, rather than stacked.\nPowering Stacked Bar charts\nA Stacked Bar chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values.

However, you can convert series from bars to lines by entering the desired number of lines here. For example, if your chart had three series, the first series appearing in your legend would appear as a line, and the remaining two series would appear as bars.

For more information about sorting, see\u00a0Sorting the Data in Your Chart.\nSyncing value scales\nBy default, the two value scales in a Stacked Bar with Line chart are matched to the data they measure, not to each other. For example, the values for your line might range from 0 to 100, and the values for your bars might range from 2 to 12. You can sync the scales by checking Sync Value Scales in Chart Properties.
