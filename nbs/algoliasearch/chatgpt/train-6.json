To retrieve public information about pages that you are not an administrator for, you need to use the Facebook Advanced connector.\nHow frequently will my data update?\nMost information about pages is updated every 24 hours.

It is recommended that\u00a0DataSets\u00a0usually be configured to run every 24 hours.\nWhy are the dates in Facebook's Insights UI and the dates in Domo sometimes different?\nOften people validate their DataSets by comparing the results of the connector to the statistics they can see in Facebook's Insights UI. When they are doing so, the dates are generally off by 1 day. For example, if the Facebook UI shows 1000 views for a page on March 3, the connector will report 1000 views with a date timestamp of March 4. This is because the API returns data for a time period that ends at the timestamp specified. In this example, there were 1000 views during the day that ended at Midnight on March 4, in other words, March 3. The Insights UI takes this into account and reports the 1000 views as having happened on March 3.\nWhat is the difference between the Facebook and Facebook Advanced connectors?\nThe Facebook Advanced connector provides more reports than the Facebook connector. The Facebook connector's reports are limited to deal directly with pages. Reports about the user, domains, application monitoring and public page information are in the Advanced connector.\nThe Facebook connector is also limited to return information about the last 30 days, while the Advanced connector allows the user to query data for any date range.\nAre there any API limits I should be aware of?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Connector"}, {"objectID": "a6913e5987cc-8", "text": "Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\nFacebook limits the number of calls that can be made each hour for each user and page.

This topic lists the questions most frequently reported by IT personnel, along with their answers:\nWhy do we need to move our data to the cloud? If it\u2019s in our on-prem system, why move it?\nDomo offers you the ability to combine data from a number of different systems in the cloud. Domo provides a place to combine data from on-prem systems with other non-on-prem systems and surfaces it for your business users. We\u00a0are not restricted by\u00a0any source system\u2019s speeds that you may have.\u00a0You can connect directly to your on-prem system and have greater speed through the Domo cloud.\nDomo works as a data mart for your data,\u00a0the idea is that you have a data warehouse and you want to take some of that data in the warehouse and surface it for a certain audience. You prepare the data that needs to be surfaced for the business questions that need to be answered, then push the data into the cloud as the data mart for your business users to access.\u00a0\nIf moving data to the cloud is out of the question or prohibited in some way, there is also an option that allows you to\u00a0move data from your on-prem system into Domo. Contact your Sales Consultant or Account Executive to discuss whether a federated option will work for your data.\nWhat kind of volumes of data does Domo handle? Does it work with transactional detail or aggregates?\nDomo can handle billions of records. There are a number of good tools for handling large amounts of data in the Domo platform.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/faqs_how_to_talk_to_it_about_domo/index.html", "title": "FAQs: How to Talk to IT about Domo"}, {"objectID": "6fcbe3595c73-1", "text": "Domo can work with transactional detail and aggregates, depending on the business question that you\u2019re trying to answer. Domo recommends aggregating the data to the level that is needed to answer the business question. You don\u2019t necessarily need every single record in your data, and it\u2019s better to aggregate it to the level of granularity that balances efficiency with insight.\nWhat does Domo mean when it uses the phrase \"real-time\"? Is it batch or streaming data?\nWhen Domo says \"real-time,\"\u00a0it means you can get insights when you need them to run your business. Real-time is defined by the use case. For some use cases, real-time means daily;\u00a0for others, it means every 15 minutes. It depends on the nature of the business question.\nBatch or streaming solutions are both provided for in Domo. In general, most datasets are processed in a fast batch format. Domo has tools for handling streaming if\u00a0needed.\nHow does Domo address data security?\nDomo has a number of ways to protect your data from being accessed by unauthorized parties:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/faqs_how_to_talk_to_it_about_domo/index.html", "title": "FAQs: How to Talk to IT about Domo"}, {"objectID": "6fcbe3595c73-2", "text": "Domo has a number of ways to protect your data from being accessed by unauthorized parties:\nUser roles and access. Currently Domo administrators can set up users with a security status of\u00a0Admin, Privileged, Editor, Participant, or Social. Each role has a specific level of access and permissions.SSO integration.\u00a0Single Sign-On is the use of an Identity Provider (IDP) communicating with Domo. The IDP manages users and manages access to Domo. When you have SSO enabled, when a user reaches Domo's login\u00a0page, instead of asking you to enter a Domo-associated username and password, the system\u00a0redirects the user to a page presented by the IDP.\u00a0This then becomes the user's\u00a0login. The SSO has multiple systems in it, and users can log into the many systems that are all linked through the IDP.\u00a0Encryption.\u00a0All of the data stored in Domo is put in a secure encrypted location. The individual values are not encrypted by default, meaning the data and columns will have individual values, but the entire DataSet is encrypted in a storage location in the cloud. Using Workbench you can choose data that needs to be encrypted, and when anyone looks at those columns in the Domo instance, they\u2019ll see the encrypted strings instead of the original values.Bring Your Own Key.\u00a0Domo BYOK is a security tool that gives complete control of the encryption keys for your Domo instance, allowing you to verify that your data is kept private at all times. Domo BYOK includes rolling generation of data encryption keys and a built-in kill switch. You can revoke the encryption key at any time, nullifying all of your data in Domo, ensuring that no one will have access to sensitive data.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/faqs_how_to_talk_to_it_about_domo/index.html", "title": "FAQs: How to Talk to IT about Domo"}, {"objectID": "6fcbe3595c73-3", "text": "Note: To use BYOK, you:\u00a0 \nmust have an Amazon Key Management System (KMS) account,cannot be on Microsoft Azure, andcannot be a Domo federated customer.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/faqs_how_to_talk_to_it_about_domo/index.html", "title": "FAQs: How to Talk to IT about Domo"}, {"objectID": "6fcbe3595c73-4", "text": "Can Domo integrate with our existing security? Do I have to recreate all of my users and groups?\nUsing SSO allows Domo to use your existing user and group structure. If you are SSO-enabled, you can make it so that when someone logs in, Domo determines what groups they\u2019re assigned to in SSO and pulls them in.\u00a0\nWhat is the resource profile to support Domo, thinking about both time and scale?\nOne of the benefits of Domo is that Domo can scale without the need for more hardware and the support of that hardware, since it\u2019s done in the cloud. It can be a huge cost-savings in a number of use cases. Domo can help run, grow, and transform the business by dramatically simplifying\u00a0your infrastructure and giving you mobile access to run your business from your phone. You don\u2019t need to hire many more people as you expand with Domo, it\u2019s more efficient in how it delivers analytic content. The Domo platform enables you to offer new kinds of services with its integrated 7 pillars, bringing new solutions that you haven\u2019t had the ability to do before.\nWho owns the data in Domo? How can I access my data?\nYou as the customer own all of your data. Domo does not prohibit any access to your data. Data can be accessed through the DomoUI and through\u00a0a robust API that allows you to export your data from your instance anytime.\u00a0\nHow do you manage or administer users in Domo?\nDomo has a number of features that allow an administrator or manager of the instance to easily work with the user, card, data ecosystems. Tools like bulk admin and activity logs allow you to see the activity that is happening in the instance and make any changes needed. There are also a number of best practice resources throughout the knowledge base in Domo to help you learn how to maintain and govern your instance.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/faqs_how_to_talk_to_it_about_domo/index.html", "title": "FAQs: How to Talk to IT about Domo"}, {"objectID": "6fcbe3595c73-5", "text": "For more information, see Card Certification.\nHow does Domo AI impact the drive to run, grow, transform, and secure your business?\nRun.

The size of these cards depends on the number of cards per slide you select in Templates. So if you select Single Card, you will get larger cards than if you selected Dual Cards or Four Cards.

Regardless of the file type you choose (CSV, XLS, or XLSX), there are a wide range of configuration options to meet your custom file needs.\nAs of our February 2018 release, there are two versions of the File Upload connector\u00a0available in Domo:\u00a0\nThe newer\u2014and recommended\u2014version of the connector provides an\u00a0intuitive workflow to make even the most complicated Excel or CSV files usable within Domo. It lets you\u00a0maintain all of the organization and configuration of your custom Excel or CSV files and still have usable data within Domo. Requiring virtually no input, this version does the heavy lifting for you.\u00a0The legacy version of this connector is also still available. This version requires you to configure a number of advanced settings (most of which are set\u00a0for you automatically when using the new version of the connector).\u00a0\nYou can begin the process of creating\u00a0a File Upload DataSet\u00a0in one of several different ways:\nBy going into the Data Center and choosing the File\u00a0option from the toolbar at the top of the screen.By clicking the\u00a0icon in the upper right corner of the\u00a0Dashboards\u00a0tab, selecting\u00a0Create new Card, selecting\u00a0Visualization, then clicking\u00a0Upload.By clicking\u00a0\u00a0in the upper right corner of the screen from anywhere in Domo, selecting\u00a0Card,\u00a0selecting\u00a0Visualization, then clicking\u00a0Upload.\nThis topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the File Upload connector user interface.

For each individual series, information about that series is provided in the other columns in the table. By default, this information includes the name of the series, an indicator showing whether the percent change for the series is positive or negative, and the degree of change. However, in the Chart Properties for the table, you can change columns to reflect any of a variety of other aspects of the series, such as the minimum or maximum value in the chart, the second-to-last value, a change value (as opposed to a percentage), etc. You can also add additional columns to the table (up to 10) with this information.\nAs a visual example, let's look at how a standard chart might appear when represented instead as a flex table. In the following Stacked Bar chart, \"Finance: AR Aging,\" information is provided for May 2013 to April 2015.

With this table, the user interested in \"AR 60+\" can see at a glance how this bucket is doing. If he wanted, he could even add additional columns to show more data, such as minimum and maximum values, last and penultimate values, etc.\u00a0\nFor information about standard and heat map tables, see\u00a0Table Chart.\nAlternate use cases\nFlex tables are usually used to show trend data, as explained in the preceding example. However, many other use cases are possible.

Data labels, when turned on, always appear for every element in a chart. This makes it easy for viewers to see information quickly but may also cause a chart to appear cluttered. Hovers, by contrast, appear only when a viewer mouses over a chart element. Using hovers rather than data labels may make identifying exact values more time-consuming; however, this also makes a chart look more clean and professional.\nBy default,\u00a0most charts use hovers, not data labels, to show the most important information for each chart element. You can change this default behavior by doing any of the following:\nTurning on data labels by\u00a0entering the desired label text in\u00a0Data Label Settings >\u00a0Text in Chart Properties. This causes data labels to always appear. Default hover text also appears when viewers mouse over chart elements.Changing the default hover text by specifying your own text in the Hover Text Settings > Text property in Chart Properties.Including both data labels and customized hovers by specifying both data label and hover text in Chart Properties.\nSome chart types have different behavior than that explained above.

For example, if all of the values in the chart represented millions of dollars, you could choose to divide by millions\u2014all of the values in hovers would then be reduced to more manageable single digits. When you choose to divide by Percentage, values in hovers are multiplied by 100. This is especially useful when your values are in decimal format and you want them to appear as percentages.Decimal PlacesDetermines the number of decimal places used in decimal values in hovers. You can choose from Default, None, and options for numbers of decimal places (from \".0\" to \".00000\").Negative NumbersDetermines the format for negative numbers in hovers. If you select -100, all negative numbers have a minus symbol affixed.

This converts all values in your chart (except for summary numbers) into percent format. You can choose whether percent values appear as is (for example, \"10\" becomes \"10%\") or the values are first multiplied by 100 (for example, \".1\" becomes \"10%\"). You can then make any property changes to your percent values in Chart Properties.\u00a0If you plan to use Chart Properties entirely, without applying universal value formatting in the column options dialog, the following tips may be of use:Ensure that your data column values use a \"x.xx\" format. For example, if you wanted a number on your value scale to read \"40%,\" that value would read as \".40\" in your DataSet.Convert your data label values into percentages by selecting Percentage under Label Format in the Chart Properties.Convert decimal values into percentages by selecting Percentage under Divide Scale By in Chart Properties You can then append percent values by changing the number format to a percentage, as described above. However, it is not recommended that you perform these steps in reverse order.Use Beast Mode to transform column values into percentages. You can use the calculation CASE WHEN `value2` > 0 THEN `value1` / `value2` ELSE 0 END to prevent zero values being divided by zero.

For example, they are often used in sales cycles to depict the number of potential customers who progress from one sales stage to the next. The largest pool\u2014often something such as website visits\u2014would be found at the top, and the smallest pool\u2014paying customers, would be at the bottom, or vice-versa.\nIn the legend for a funnel chart, the percentage for each successive layer is derived from the value of the previous layer. This functionality is appropriate for\u00a0conversion charts, in which you want to show the degree of change\u00a0from one process to the next. Prior to October 2016, a \"Legacy\" version of the funnel was available in which percentages were derived from the chart total, as in a standard Pie chart. This version of the funnel is now deprecated, however. \u00a0\nIn addition to the standard funnel-shaped chart, funnel charts have two subtypes, as follows:\nSubtypeDescriptionFolded funnelIn a folded funnel chart, the sections appear \"folded,\" and each section takes on the relative size of its percentage of the chart. Because the sections appear as straight bars, this kind of funnel chart depicts the relative sizes of each section more accurately and understandably than a standard funnel chart.Funnel barsA funnel bars chart is a combination of a funnel chart and a horizontal\u00a0bar chart. This chart type shows differences between stages in a process (such as a sales cycle). For each stage in the process, the data for the previous round drops off, so that only the relationships between the current round and all subsequent rounds is shown. In essence, this chart type shows \"what's left\" after each stage in a process.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/funnel_chart/index.html", "title": "Funnel Chart"}, {"objectID": "11d251929d63-1", "text": "Note: Drill capability is not available for funnel charts. For more information about drilling, see\u00a0Adding Drill Path to Your Chart.\n\n\n\nPowering funnel charts\nAll funnel chart subtypes require two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a category column or row containing the names of each funnel section, and a value column or row containing the corresponding values for each section. The numbers in the values column or row do not need to add up to 100%. For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn a standard funnel chart, you can choose\u00a0the desired\u00a0sort method in the Sorting menu. In folded funnel and funnel bars charts, the sections in your funnel are always arranged in order from highest to lowest value. Because of the nature of these charts, this automatic sorting cannot be changed. For more information about sorting, see\u00a0Sorting the Data in Your Chart.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your funnel chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nFor more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\u00a0Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.\nThe following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a funnel chart:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/funnel_chart/index.html", "title": "Funnel Chart"}, {"objectID": "11d251929d63-2", "text": "Customizing funnel charts\nYou can customize the appearance of a funnel chart by editing its Chart Properties.

However, it can be difficult to sort them in the order you want, as the default is alphabetical. You can resolve this issue by creating a Beast Mode calculation to override the default alphabetical sort and create the sort you want.\nFor example, let's say a user wants to sort sales stages in the following order:\nBullpenOn-Deck1st Base2nd Base3rd Base\nBy default, however, the stages are sorted alphabetically, as follows:\n1st Base2nd Base3rd BaseBullpenOn-Deck\nSo the user creates a new column using the following Beast Mode calculation:\n CASE\nWHEN `stage_name` = \u2018Bullpen\u2019 THEN 1\nWHEN `stage_name` = \u2018On-Deck\u2019 THEN 2\nWHEN `stage_name` = \u20181st Base\u2019 THEN 3\nWHEN `stage_name` = \u20182nd Base\u2019 THEN 4\nWHEN `stage_name` = \u20183rd Base\u2019 THEN 5\nELSE \u2018Other\u2019\nEND  \u00a0\nYou can also do another Beast Mode calculation to concatenate the number and the stage name column to show a full text value like: \u201c5:3rd Base\u201d then put that Beast Mode into the Analyzer instead of the regular stage name column. The default alphabetical sorting will then work with the number at the front. This is useful if you refer to your stages by their numbers at times, e.g. \u201cYes, that opportunity transitioned to stage 4 today.\u201d", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/funnel_chart/index.html", "title": "Funnel Chart"}, {"objectID": "7aa8aef48fb6-0", "text": "TitleFun Sample DataSetsArticle BodyIntro\nIt's hard learning how to perform advanced data analysis and write meaningful Beast Mode calculations when all you've got to work with is boring old marketing campaign spreadsheets.

Each task in a project is represented as a horizontal bar with a start date and end date. Tasks are represented along the vertical axis, and dates are represented along the horizontal axis. You can break tasks down by project, in which case each project is shown in a different color and appears as a legend item. However, projects are optional in Gantt charts.\nThere are three types of Gantt charts in Domo\u2014regular Gantt charts, Gantt Percent Complete charts, and Dependency Gantt charts. The difference between these is that Gantt Percent Complete charts show the completion percentage for each task bar. For any series, this percentage is represented by the amount of colored fill in the bar. The fill amount compared to the total length of the bar gives the viewer an idea of the percentage complete for that task. For example, if the fill for a series filled almost the entire bar, a viewer could deduce that the task was nearly complete. The Dependency Gantt chart handles changes in dates for you and gives many new display options to communicate project timelines.\nPowering Gantt charts\nStandard Gantt charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for tasks, one with start dates for each task, and one for end dates for each task. Percent Complete Gantt charts require all of these as well as a fourth column containing percent complete values for each task. If you want, you can also add an additional column containing project category data to a Gantt chart. Adding project category data to a Gantt chart causes the bars for each category to appear in different colors, indicating multiple projects. Also, a legend is added to the chart showing you which project category is which.\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/gantt_chart/index.html", "title": "Gantt Chart"}, {"objectID": "8a2e2495c536-2", "text": "For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Gantt chart.

Having a well-prepared and cleansed DataSet is critical for successful outcomes when\u00a0using the tool, but is also an excellent way to bolster your DSML capabilities. Below, we provide a data prep checklist for AutoML.\nGather all data and metrics into Domo:\u00a0First, all of your data needs to be pushed to Domo. This includes both your output variable (what want to predict) and your input variables (what you will use to predict.)\u00a0Input variables are also commonly referred to as features by machine learning practitioners.Data Structure: The following are guidelines for structuring your DataSet:\nSingular DataSet: Spend some time gathering your data together into one DataSet that has one column with the output variable (the variable you want to predict that AutoML will train on) and many columns that enumerate the inputs that you expect to have an effect/influence on your output column.Identify the outcome: Be sure to only include one output column for your DataSet.Unit of analysis: Each row should encapsulate one record in your business problem. For example, if you would like to predict which sales opportunity will close, each row should enumerate one distinct sales opportunity, from start to finish, with the output column listing the result of the sales opportunity (ie won or lost.)Data Preparation: Once you have structured your data correctly, you should be following these preprocessing guidelines:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/getting_your_data_ready_for_automl/index.html", "title": "Getting Your Data Ready for AutoML"}, {"objectID": "6ff775e5a83e-1", "text": "Missing Data: Intelligently handling missing data can improve model performance. Rows missing values in\u00a0certain columns should be dropped, or filled in an intelligent way (e.g., mean or median of column.)Check and remove multicollinearity: You should be very careful about having redundancy in your data. For example, suppose you have two predictor columns \u201cSales\u201d and \u201cRevenue\u201d and want to predict \u201cProfit.\u201d Because \u201cSales\u201d and \u201cRevenue\u201d represent nearly identical quantities, cash flow\u00a0coming into the business, you should only include one of them. Using both can cause numerical stability issues in some algorithms. It is very common for DataSets to have columns that are unexpectedly highly correlated, so it can be useful to visualize the relationships between the columns or test for correlations statistically. One of the correlated columns can be dropped and can lead to increases in performance.Include the relevant columns only:\u00a0You should drop any columns that you do not suspect to influence your target. ID and raw date columns likely fall into this category. Think", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/getting_your_data_ready_for_automl/index.html", "title": "Getting Your Data Ready for AutoML"}, {"objectID": "6ff775e5a83e-2", "text": "and raw date columns likely fall into this category. Think carefully about what you know about the process and if your data correctly represents\u00a0what you would know at prediction time.Outliers / Leverage Points: If possible, you should remove known outliers. You can determine outliers either from statistical tests, or known experience. For example, if sales were artificially high one week due to some known anomaly you may want to consider removing this sample from your DataSet.Feature Engineering: Finally, you should spend time thinking about the best representation of your data. This process is referred to as \u201cfeature engineering.\u201d Fortunately, AutoML does some basic feature engineering for us. For example, it will encode a \u201cgender\u201d column with values \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF\u201d as 0\u2019s as 1\u2019s. This allows us to focus more on the prior knowledge you have about your problem. A common example of the feature engineering you should think about is transforming raw data such as 10-22-2020 to the day of the week: \u201cThursday.\u201d This is a more helpful representation as it", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/getting_your_data_ready_for_automl/index.html", "title": "Getting Your Data Ready for AutoML"}, {"objectID": "6ff775e5a83e-3", "text": "\u201cThursday.\u201d This is a more helpful representation as it enables the model to learn patterns that might correspond to the day of the week. Other common feature engineering strategies are enumerated below:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/getting_your_data_ready_for_automl/index.html", "title": "Getting Your Data Ready for AutoML"}, {"objectID": "6ff775e5a83e-4", "text": "Binning: If meaningful categories exist from numeric data, you may consider creating discrete \u201cbins.\u201d A good example of this is the credit scoring system. While a FICO credit score offers a continuous, numeric value (0-800), banks will often create bins or tiers to facilitate easier decision making. A score over 750 might be considered \u201cexcellent,\u201d\u00a0while a score between 700 and 749 is \u201cgood.\u201d If natural tiers exist in your problem, it may be helpful to encode them in your data. Additionally, time-series data can also be manipulated by binning. Dates across multiple years can be binned into the week of the year.Data Reductions: A good model will have the fewest number of features that explain the data. Wherever possible, you should seek to remove redundant or unimportant columns. By including meaningless features you add noise, rather than signal, to your model.Feature Scaling: AutoML automatically performs feature scaling on your data. In general, it is good practice to think about the scale of your features. If you have two variables that are each on a very different scale, it can cause issues when training certain types of algorithms. For example, if one feature ranges between 0.001 and 0.1, while another ranges between 100,000 and 1,000,000 issues of numerical instability may arise. To solve this problem, you have two options: standardization and normalization. For a good article defining and comparing the two, see https://towardsdatascience.com/normalization-vs-standardization-cb8fe15082eb.\nFollowing this checklist will improve your chances of training an effective model with AutoML.

It connects via a Domo defined Google app to support OAuth connections, so you'll need a valid username and password that has access to BigQuery. Once connected, you'll specify the location of the BigQuery Project and Table to write to.\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need your Google credentials (email address and password). Your Google account must have permissions to access the tables and data needed for the query.\nHow do I know that my login credentials are secure?\nThe login process uses the OAuth process, so your Google credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\nHow often can the data be updated?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/google_bigquery_oauth_writeback_connector/index.html", "title": "Google BigQuery OAuth Writeback Connector"}, {"objectID": "6286bd56898b-3", "text": "How often can the data be updated?\nAs often as needed.\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\nNone\nHow do I find the Input Dataset ID?\nYour Domo input dataset id is in the URL of the dataset you are exporting data from.Example: https://customer.domo.com/datasources/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee/details/settings", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/google_bigquery_oauth_writeback_connector/index.html", "title": "Google BigQuery OAuth Writeback Connector"}, {"objectID": "55474fdcf330-0", "text": "TitleGoogle BigQuery Service ConnectorArticle Body\nIntro\nGoogle BigQuery is a cloud-based big data analytics web service for processing very large read-only data sets.

Setting Max Results to a smaller value, such as 1000, then paging through results, may improve reliability when the query result set is large.\u00a0\nIn addition to Domo's Max Results row limit, Google imposes a byte limit of 10 MB per page of results.
