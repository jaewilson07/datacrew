This article describes in detail what you should do in both scenarios.\nScenario #1: Jobs Are Failing on an Automated Schedule\nIf you encounter the issue of Workbench Jobs failing on an automated schedule\u00a0while successfully\u00a0running manually, you may consider checking permissions and rights for the Windows Workbench Service. \nWhen running a Job manually in Workbench, Windows recognizes this as a user-requested action and treats it accordingly. Any local permissions granted to this user is passed down through this user-requested action. If you\u2019re a local Admin, the Job is run with \u201cAdmin\u201d rights. Conversely, a Workbench Job running on an automated schedule is initiated by the Workbench service itself. Depending on the credentials used to authorize the Workbench service, it may or may not have elevated permissions sufficient to execute that same Job. The schedule kicks off the job, but fails in lacking proper permissions.\nBy default, the Workbench service starts with \u201cLocal System\u201d permissions. Depending on your IT security policies, this user may be denied the rights necessary to execute tasks or access data sources within your network. \nA few possible solutions:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/resolving_issues_with_failing_jobs_in_workbench_4/index.html", "title": "Resolving Issues with Failing Jobs in Workbench 4"}, {"objectID": "09d23d8299de-2", "text": "A few possible solutions:\nAs it is considered best practice to run the Workbench service as \u201cLocal System,\u201d\u00a0your IT group may be able to modify the local security policies of your PC to 1) allow the service to access the internet, incoming and outgoing on ports 80 and 443,\u00a0and 2) allow the service to execute tasks as an Administrator.If the above option is not feasible, your IT group can create a service account with full Admin rights\u00a0at either the local or domain level. This service account will be used in lieu of \u201cLocal System.\u201d\u00a0To switch the Workbench service to the new service account, do the following: Click the Start button, then type \u201cservices.\u201dIn Services, locate and right-click on Domo Workbench, then select Properties.Click the Log On tab.Change the selected radio button to This account.Enter the credentials supplied by your IT group.Restart the service when prompted.If the service starts successfully, the credentials were accepted.If your IT group is unable to modify the permissions for Local System or create a service account, you can use your own credentials, either local or domain.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/resolving_issues_with_failing_jobs_in_workbench_4/index.html", "title": "Resolving Issues with Failing Jobs in Workbench 4"}, {"objectID": "09d23d8299de-3", "text": "Note: This is not a recommended configuration.

This is the blue series at the bottom of each stack. All other series are shown with their literal values.Category Scale > Never Use Time ScaleDetermines which type of timeline is used in supported charts with time data.\nBy default, when time data is used in supported charts, such as Line and Bar charts, Domo automatically makes it appear using a date grain appropriate for your data. This is shown in the first example at right, in which the timeline takes date data spanning several months and shows it by month.\nIf you check this box, however, date data appears as it does in your DataSet. This is shown in the second example at right, in which the time scale uses individual dates, as in the DataSet.\nThis option is available for Vertical Bar charts only.\nValue Scale > Title PositionDetermines whether value scale labels in Vertical Bar charts appear to the left of the chart or above it.\n\n\n\n\nNote: This property is deprecated as of our October 2016 release.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/running_total_stacked_bar_chart/index.html", "title": "Running Total Stacked Bar Chart"}, {"objectID": "0a297fc3ee4c-2", "text": "Note: This property is deprecated as of our October 2016 release.\n\n\n\u2014\nChanging the size of bars in a Running Total Stacked Bar chart\nFor any Bar chart, you can set the percentage of space taken up by bars in that chart or specify a fixed bar width.

Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.This change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to get your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.Additional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/sage_intacct_connector/index.html", "title": "Sage Intacct Connector"}, {"objectID": "7a3971a13cd5-1", "text": "Intro\nIntacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software.

You can then compile reports based on Salesforce data.

It all depends on how Salesforce was implemented, and the objects/modules created.Average Implementation TimeDepends on the object/report/data size, but Salesforce is very quick to implement. It would take minutes to pull data through once you identify what you need. A very large data pull (millions of rows) would take about an hour.Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)4\n\u00a0\nWhat's New\nSome recent enhancements to this connector are...\nA setting that, if selected, allows the connector to automatically add columns to the output as they are createdA Date\u00a0Field setting that pulls all of the data based on your\u00a0Last Updated date.\nBest Practices\nWhen using the Object Browser mode, Salesforce includes related objects (e.g. Opportunity and Account), so fields from each related object can be brought into the same DataSet. This prevents you from having to always pull in the objects independently (i.e. a separate Opportunity object and Account object) and join them in a DataFlow.\nPrerequisites\nTo connect to your Salesforce account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/salesforce_connector/index.html", "title": "Salesforce Connector"}, {"objectID": "968e8952ddc2-2", "text": "Prerequisites\nTo connect to your Salesforce account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\nThe username for your Salesforce accountThe password for your Salesforce accountAn installed Domo Connector Package from the Salesforce AppExchange\u00a0(required as of August 1, 2018; see next section for installation instructions)\nInstalling the Domo Connector Package\nThe \"Domo Connector Package\" found in Salesforce AppExchange allows Salesforce users to import their data into Domo.

Most of the issues are due to insufficient permissions (on both the object and the field). Your Salesforce admin should be able to upgrade permissions on specific objects and fields.\nAnother common error is the \u201cQuery Locator Error.\u201d\u00a0Salesforce only keeps 10 query locators at a time for a single user and for a maximum of 15 minutes. If too many DataSets are running at the same time, some of these will fail. The best way to avoid this issue is to spread out the times when the DataSets are running.\nFAQ\nMy profile seems to be not fully set up with the Domo Connector Package. Why?\nSometimes a Salesforce profile will get set up after the Domo Connector Package has been installed. Your profile may not get fully set up\u00a0even if it gets installed for all users again. In this case, your Salesforce admin will need to go into the user's profile and look for the Apex Class List permission. Once in there, the admin can search for the two DomoReporting apps and add them to the Apex Class List. Once this has been saved, you should be able to use the Salesforce Connector in Domo.\nHow many rows and columns of data can a pre-built report pull at one time?\nStandard and pre-built reports only pull a maximum of 2,000 rows and 100 columns at a time. This is a limitation of the Salesforce API. You can bring in more than 2,000 rows by using the Unique Field option in the Data Selection Pane. The unique field column you choose must not contain any duplicate values otherwise the report will not match what Salesforce shows.\nWhy do I not see my reports in the report drop down menu?\nReports must be in table format and made public in order to appear in the connector and before the data can be pulled in.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/salesforce_connector/index.html", "title": "Salesforce Connector"}, {"objectID": "968e8952ddc2-8", "text": "Why am I unable to select all the columns wanted using the browse picklists option?\nIf you\u2019re testing tables across multiple objects, using the browse picklists, you can only nest down two levels.

For example, to rename a column named \"daily_total\" to \"Daily Total\", create a calculation named \"Daily Total\" with the following code:\n`daily_total`\nIf you want to sum the column, use the following code:\nsum(`daily_total`)\nAfter saving your calculation, click the new column name in the\u00a0Columns list to display the column in your card.\nChange Values in a Column\nYou can use a calculation to change a specified column value to a different value. For example, if you had a column called \"Employee Last Name\" and you wanted to change all instances of \"Janssen\" in the column to \"Janssen-Soderquist,\" you would create a calculation\u00a0with the following code:\ncase when `Employee Last Name` = 'Janssen'then 'Janssen-Soderquist'else `Employee Last Name`end\nFilter Values in a Column\nYou can filter values in a column by creating a calculation, then setting a filter to include or exclude the fields with the value you want. For example, assume you have a column of US states and you want to filter out State = TX, use this code:\ncase when `State` = 'TX'then 0else 1end\nThen set a filter\u00a0where the column does not include 0.\nAlternately, if you have multiple values you want to filter out:\ncase when `State` in ('NY', 'TX')then 0else 1end\nThen set a filter where the column does not include 0.\nOr, when looking for patterns:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/sample_beast_mode_calculations_basic_transforms/index.html", "title": "Sample Beast Mode Calculations: Basic Transforms"}, {"objectID": "8ce6f14868a9-2", "text": "Or, when looking for patterns:\ncasewhen `State` like '%TX%' then 0when `State` like '%NY%' then 0else 1end\nThen set a filter where the column does not include 0.\nForce a Sort Order\nYou can tell Beast Mode to sort data the way you want.\nCASEWHEN `Development Status` = 'Requested' THEN 1WHEN `Development Status` = 'In Development' THEN 2WHEN `Development Status` = 'Code Complete' THEN 3WHEN `Development Status` = 'Data Mapping' THEN 4WHEN `Development Status` = 'Ready' THEN 5WHEN `Development Status` = 'Deployer' THEN 6WHEN `Development Status` = 'Forecasted' THEN 7WHEN `Development Status` = 'Hold' THEN 8 ELSE 0END\nSort by the column with numerical values.\nRemove Numbers from Text\nTo remove numbers from text fields (for example, the fields include a name and ID number and you want just the names), use a Beast Mode calculation like this:\nSUBSTRING(`text_Field`,INSTR(`text_Field`,' ')+1)\nReplace the text_Field\u00a0text with the name of the column you want to remove numbers from.

Note that even though this looks like a date, Domo will consider it a character value. You cannot use the date grain selector on this value, as all cards using this Beast Mode will always be locked to weekly.\nOption 2\nDATE_FORMAT(SUBDATE(`Date`,WEEKDAY(`Date`)-1),'%m/%d/%Y')\nThis is the same as the previous option but formats the date differently (so \"01/04/2015\" is returned instead of \"2015-01-04.\"\nOption 3\nCONCAT('Week beg: ',DATE_FORMAT(SUBDATE(`Date`,WEEKDAY(`Date`)-1),'%b-%d'))\nThis version puts the text \"Week beg:\" and then only shows the month and day of that week's\u00a0Sunday.

Set the filter to \"Closed Month.\" Then, whenever you update the webform value, you will get new data displaying in all cards that use that filter.\nAnother option that won't require any manual intervention each month would be to\u00a0use a DataFlow to calculate the MAX(`Date`) and add a column that identifies all data that is in the same month as the MAX(`Date`).

They are usually used in scientific applications, especially physics, in which they often show energy inputs, useful output, and wasted output. However, they are often used in business as well, especially in showing cost breakdowns, inventory flows, web traffic, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a Sankey chart, items are connected to other items using colored lines or arrows. Each pairing has a value. The thickness of any connecting line is determined by the value of the pairing in comparison to other values found in the dataset. For example, if point A was connected to point B and had a value of 10,000, and this value was among the greater values in the dataset, the line would appear thick. On the other hand, if the value of 10,000 was among the smaller values in the dataset, it would appear thin.\nThe following screenshot shows an example of a publicly available Sankey chart. This chart shows both production and imports of various fuel sources and their total final consumption for the country of Iceland. Note that the line for the production of geothermal energy is far larger than the others (indicated by the thick brown connector line).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n This screenshot was taken from the World Balance website at iea.org (International Energy Agency), which shows energy production and consumption for most nations in the world. To visit this site, see World Balance (2017).\nFor\u00a0another interesting real-world example\u00a0of a Sankey chart, see\u00a0\"What are you going to do with that degree?\"\u00a0This chart shows how college majors tie to professions, based on data from the American Community survey.

The items in the \"From\" column appear on the left side of the chart, and the items in the \"To\" column appear on the right side. For information about the different kinds of data in a chart, see Understanding Chart Data.\nAt minimum, a Sankey chart contains two groupings\u2014an \"input\" grouping on the left and an \"output\" grouping on the right. In this simple version of the chart, input items connect to one or more output items, but the output items themselves do not connect to other output items. So item A might connect to items B, C, and D, but B, C, and D would not have their own connections. This is exemplified in the following simple DataSet showing the flow of money between different nations. Note that all countries in the \"From\" column are paired with another country in the \"To\" category, but the \"To\" countries do not have their own connections; they are \"dead ends\" in the data.\n\u00a0\nWhen this DataSet is visualized, the resulting chart looks something like the following, with direct connections between the input and output countries; no intermediary countries appear in the flow.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/sankey_chart/index.html", "title": "Sankey Chart"}, {"objectID": "d1a7ac7677ef-3", "text": "You can also have a more complex chart, with multiple output groupings. You can do this by structuring your data so that output items that should have their own connections are shown in both the \"From\" and \"To\" columns. In the following example DataSet, all intermediary countries (i.e. those that receive money as well as send it to others) appear in both the \"To\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"From\" columns. For example, Portugal receives payment from Brazil, and Angola, China, and Japan receive payment from Portugal.

You can select a card\u00a0image to open the card Details view directly in Domo, or a dashboard image to open that dashboard. The image used for a given card is the same as the \"Large\" view of the card in a dashboard; therefore, any information in a card that does not appear in the dashboard view will likewise not appear in the report version (such as the \"Total\" value that appears in the Details for a Pie graph).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: Card descriptions are not supported in scheduled reports.

This option can only be modified by an Admin user.A new option under\u00a0Additional Settings\u00a0for a DataSet Job lets you specify whether the Job waits for Adrenaline indexing before completing.\u00a0If you change the impersonation credentials on a DataSet Job, Workbench now asks you if you want to change the credentials for all jobs that use those credentials.   \tLikewise, if you change the impersonation credentials for a provider, you are asked if you want to\u00a0change credentials\u00a0on all Jobs that use that provider.  In the Job Scheduler, if a DataSet Job is from a local file provider, you can now select\u00a0Watch File\u00a0for the Job.

Simply visit the AppStore and power up the new DataSets using the new connector. Amazon MWS API has strict API throttling, and the connector does everything possible to globally pace requests. However, we\u00a0recommend\u00a0spreading out DataSet runs throughout the entire day and night. This is especially true for the \"Orders\" suite of reports.\nOnce you have created your DataSets in the new connector, you should stop importing new data in the old connector by turning off imports in the \"Schedule\" section of the old connector. Once the DataSet is completely migrated, ensure that all cards and ETL logic is powered from the new DataSet. Finally, you can delete the old DataSet.When do I need to have this done?\nTo ensure continuous service, please ensure that all your DataSets are set up in the new connector by October 11th, 2018. On October 12th, we will be marking the version 0 connector and anything associated with it as legacy and it will stop importing new data.\nWhat if I have additional questions?As always, we welcome and appreciate your feedback.

E.g., suppose the connector initially infers that column is a numeric because that\u2019s what coming in during the first run. If on the next run, the query returns something with a character and a numeric, then the connector will fail because it will recognize the column as String instead of numeric.The connector will ingest the fields the API sends over.

The Color Rules tool in Analyzer helps you do both. Using Color Rules, you can apply colors to specific columns in a chart or set conditions in which certain colors are shown.\nFor example, the owner of the ABC Cafe wants to replace the default Domo color scheme with a custom scheme more fitting for his business. He does this by going into the Color Rules dialog and setting the \"Sales\" series column to red and the \"Profit\" series column to black.\nAs another example, a user wants to be made instantly aware when profit values in a bar chart fall under a certain threshold. To this end, he sets a color rule on the value column specifying that a red color be applied to bars falling under a specific amount. This is shown in the following screenshot:\u00a0\n\nThe color rule for this example is basically as follows: \"If the value of 'Profit' falls below 50,000 for a product subcategory, the bar for that subcategory appears red; otherwise the default color (blue) is applied.\"\nWhen you apply Color Rules to a chart, you are given the option to apply the rules to this card only or to all cards powered by this same DataSet. The latter option is a great way to ensure that all of your charts built with the same DataSets use the same custom color scheme. So, the user who created the chart in the first example could use this option to ensure that all cards built on this DataSet use the red/black color scheme for Sales and Profits, just as this card does.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\u00a0You cannot change all cards powered by a DataSet unless you are the DataSet\u00a0owner or have an \"Admin\" security profile or a custom role with \"Manage DataSets\" enabled.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/setting_color_rules_for_a_chart/index.html", "title": "Setting Color Rules for a Chart"}, {"objectID": "ed962eb4dc6c-1", "text": "The Color Rules tool is available for all\u00a0chart types except for the following:\nAll mapsAll gaugesBox plot\u00a0Funnel barsFolded funnelHeat mapCategory scatterCandlestickHigh lowCalendar\nYou can customize map colors by applying color \"themes.\" Color themes use different shades to denote various ranges in map data. For more information, see\u00a0Changing Colors in Maps.\nFor any chart or table, up to 100 color rules are allowed. This includes both card- and DataSet-level rules. For a drill view this limit is a combination of all color rules in all parent views.

However, they are not currently recommended for use in charts with series data (such as multi-bar charts) unless you are applying color rules to the column with series data, as in the previous example (not the category or value columns).\u00a0\nYou set color rules on a chart by clicking Color Rules in the toolbar at the top of the Analyzer window then choosing the column you want to apply the rule to and setting the conditions (if any) and color.\nBecause there are so many different scenarios for applying color rules to a chart, we present instructions for the two most common use cases: setting custom (static) colors and setting dynamic colors based on conditions.\u00a0\nUse case #1: Setting custom colors using color rules\nTo set custom colors on a chart (as in the first example in this topic), it is recommended you apply them to category columns in single-series charts (such as standard bar and line charts) and series columns in multi-series charts (such as grouped bar and multi-line charts). You should not apply color rules to value columns when setting custom colors.\nTo set custom colors on a chart,\nOpen the Analyzer for the card you want to set custom colors for.You can do this by selecting Edit in Analyzer in either the page view or Details view for the card, or by clicking  in the Details view.(Optional) If the Analyzer toolbar is not expanded near the top of the window, click \u00a0to expand it.Click the Color Rules button in the toolbar.In the Column dropdown, select the text or date column you want to set a custom color on.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/setting_color_rules_for_a_chart/index.html", "title": "Setting Color Rules for a Chart"}, {"objectID": "ed962eb4dc6c-3", "text": "Tip: You can choose from any columns in your DataSet, not just the ones you have applied to this chart.

You could go a step further and set a second rule on the same column stating that all values above the specified value appear green.

However, you can apply value formatting to the number and change the aggregation. For more information, see  Customizing Single Value gauges.\nProgress bar gauges are not currently customizable.\nFormatting the appearance of filled and comparative fill gauges\nWith filled gauges, you can set several visual properties, including the fill color and the minimum, maximum, and target values on the gauge.
