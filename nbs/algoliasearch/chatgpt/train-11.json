You can set alerts for policies you are a member of. Only those who are also members of those policies can view and subscribe to those alerts.\nYou configure PDP for alerts\u00a0in Step 1 of the Alert Wizard for the desired card. PDP options appear for a card only when one or more PDP policies have been applied to a DataSet for that card. You can choose from the following options for configuring PDP\u00a0for a card alert:\nContextual. Anyone permitted to view the DataSet(s) powering the card will be able to view this alert.\u00a0This option works best with percentage and statistical alerts. This is the default setting.\u00a0All Rows. The alert is applied to all rows of the DataSet\u00a0(i.e. no filtering occurs).\u00a0Select Policies. You choose the specific policy or policies to which the alert is applied.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs an example, suppose user \"Bob\" owns a DataSet called \"Marketo Opportunities.\" Bob's\u00a0marketing team is broken up by industry, and he is assigned to both Advertising as well as Business Services. Bob wants to set up an alert to notify him when opportunities drop by more than 10%.\u00a0\nWhen Bob goes to create an alert on this card, as the DataSet owner\u00a0he is given the option to apply the alert to the \"Advertising,\" to \"Business Services,\" or to\u00a0all of the data in the DataSet (unfiltered).

Because the \"Advertising\" PDP policy was chosen and not the \"Business Services\" policy, only users in that group can see the alert,\u00a0subscribe to it, and receive notifications for it. However, Bob could then create a second alert for this card that applied only to the \"Business Services\" policy.\u00a0\nMembers of PDP policies can also create alerts on cards powered by PDP-affected DataSets. Because the data in the card is already filtered due to PDP policies in place, these users can create alerts\u00a0only\u00a0around the data available to them through their policies. Only users with the creator's same PDP policies\u00a0are able to see the alert, subscribe to it, and receive notifications for it.\nFor example, suppose that user \"Tessa\" is a policy member for both the \"Advertising\" and \"Business Services\" regions.

The following screenshot shows you how this might appear:\nIn this example, earnings for the previous year are represented by a dark blue bar. Earnings for the three years before that are also represented as bars.

Each subsequent column or row you add becomes a new grouping within the previously added grouping.\nThis article describes how to manage Pivot Tables in Domo in the following categories:\nPivot Table capabilitiesPowering Pivot TablesCustomizing Pivot TablesBest practices for Pivot Tables\nPivot Table Capabilities\nPivot Tables provide the following capabilities:\nAlert integrationBeast Mode supportCard-to-Card Filter supportColor rulesColor/attribute control by row and columnConnect and update data, as with any other chart typeDrill PathDomo Embed supportExpand/collapse rows and columnsExport to Excel and CSV\u00a0or PowerPointFull integration with AnalyzerFull mobile supportHighlighting and selection by row and column groupingIndependent control over row and column totalsMuch larger table handlingQuick Filters supportShare via emailSummary Numbers\nPivot Tables have Table Calculation functionality.

You can change the order of a grouping by dragging a column to your desired location in the field.\nColumns retain their unique data types after you drag them into a field. You can select columns in the Rows, Columns, and Values fields to access additional options, such as aggregation and formatting.

They drag the \"Region\" column into Columns above the chart preview. This adds a \"Region\" header row at the top of the table, adds a \"Profit \" column to the right side of the table, and divides the table into four \"Profit\" columns, one for each region.This is a little more helpful, but still lacks specifics.

You must identify these elements yourself in the DataSet you use to power the chart. However, you can use tools such as R and Python to help you identify these elements.\nPowering Predictive Modeling charts\nPredictive Modeling charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet, or five if you plan to show upper and lower bounds. One column contains the X coordinate values for the chart. All remaining columns contain Y coordinate values to be paired with their corresponding X coordinate value to form various elements in the chart. These Y coordinate columns are as follows:\nA column with Y coordinate values for the points in the chart (required).A column with Y coordinate values for the model fit line (required).A column with Y coordinate values for the upper bound (optional).A column with Y coordinate values for the lower bound (optional).\nFor an example of how to set up your data, see the graphic below.\u00a0\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Predictive Modeling chart.

A third possible reason is that you're using a VPN that accesses your network through a proxy server.

A Progress Bar gauge is similar to a thermometer that \"fills in\" to show how close the current value is to the goal. This gauge type does not include ranges. This gauge type is similar to a Filled gauge, which also \"fills in\" to show the proximity of the current value to the target\u2014the difference is that a Progress Bar gauge shows the value as a percentage, whereas a Filled gauge shows the actual value.\nOther gauge types in Domo include Comparative Fill gauges.\nPowering Progress Bar gauges\nA Progress Bar gauge requires three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one contains the current value of the gauge, one contains the maximum value, and the other contains the label that appears above the gauge. If multiple rows are present, only the data from the first row is used; all the others are ignored. If the first category contains more than one series, the series are aggregated to yield a single value for the gauge. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the maximum value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for \"Team A\" that both had a maximum value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new maximum value of 200. Selecting No Aggregation for either the current value or maximum does not currently work.\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see\u00a0Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Progress Bar gauge.

Domo provides the ability to create such \"data projections.\" Data projections give viewers an idea of how the data might change between the current value of a chart and upcoming future values.\nData projections come in two types\u2014Last Value Projections and Multi-Period Projections. Last Value Projections project only the last value in your chart, but you can use several different kinds of calculations to make the projection, including linear regression, averaging the previous values, etc. Multi-Period Projections let you project as many future periods as you want, either by using included controls to add and remove periods or by manually entering the desired number in Chart Properties. However, all multi-period projections are based on linear regression (though a number of different options are available for configuring your linear regression).\u00a0\nLast Value Projections\nLast Value Projections let you project one future value onto your chart. These are available for the following chart types:\nVertical single barVertical grouped barVertical stacked barLine barMulti-line barLine with grouped barLineMulti-lineCurved lineSymbol lineCurved symbol line\nIn line charts, dotted lines are\u00a0used to show how far data values are\u00a0expected to fall or drop when a Last Value Projection is applied. In the following example, the data value is expected to rise to about $27,000, based on a linear regression:\n\u00a0\n\nYou could also set projections in a chart with multiple lines, like in the following example:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/projecting_the_last_value_in_your_chart/index.html", "title": "Projecting the Last Value in Your Chart"}, {"objectID": "4fabdd6d0f98-1", "text": "You could also set projections in a chart with multiple lines, like in the following example:\n\u00a0\n\nLikewise, a dotted line is used in a bar chart to show the expected change.

In the following example, the user created a projection based on the average of the three values prior to the last value:\n\u00a0\n\nYou could also set projections in a chart with grouped or stacked bars, like in the following example:\n\u00a0\n\nFor a grouped bar with line chart, you can choose to apply a projection to either the last bar or last line that appears in the chart (or both).\u00a0\nVideo - Using Last Value Projections", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/projecting_the_last_value_in_your_chart/index.html", "title": "Projecting the Last Value in Your Chart"}, {"objectID": "4fabdd6d0f98-2", "text": "Types of Last Value Projections\nThere are four possible types of Last Value Projections in Domo. These are as follows:\nProjection TypeDescriptionForecast ValueDomo forecasts the value of the remainder of the current period in your chart. It does this by taking the current value for the period and comparing it to the previous period. For example, in the following chart, the current month, October, is not yet over, so the user applies the Forecast property. The light blue represents the forecasted value for the entire month of October.\nSpecified ValueYou specify the projected value yourself. When you select this option, you must enter the desired value in the Projection Value field.Average Previous ValuesDomo calculates the projection based on the average of a specified number of values prior to the current value. You specify the number of values in the Previous Values to Average field.Linear RegressionDomo calculates the projection based on a linear regression of your data.\nCreating a Last Value Projection\nYou can add a Last Value Projection to your\u00a0chart in the Chart Properties.\nTo add a projection to your chart,\nOpen the Analyzer for the\u00a0chart you want to edit.In Chart Properties, click Last Value Projection (for a bar or line chart) or Last Bar Value Projection or Last Line Value Projection (for a grouped bar with line chart).Select the projection type in the Project Using menu.(Conditional) If you select Specified Value, enter the desired value in the Projection Value field.(Conditional) If you select Average Previous Values, enter the number of previous values for which you want to take the average.\nUse Cases\nThe following projection use cases were introduced in the Domopalooza 2017 Tips and Tricks session.

The following options are available:Linear RegressionDomo calculates the projection based on a linear regression of your data. This is the default option. \u00a0Linear Regression by PeriodProjections are calculated by looking at all similar data points in your data and determining the linear regression for each individual point. For example, if your data was broken down by week and you chose this option, a separate linear regression would be calculated for all Mondays, all Tuesdays, and so on. At least 2 instances of each data point are required for this to work (e.g. your timeline must have 2 Mondays, 2 Tuesdays, etc.); otherwise the\u00a0Linear Regression Recent Periods\u00a0option will be used as a fallback.\u00a0Linear Regression Recent PeriodsProjections are calculated by taking the linear regressions for the data points in the most recent period and applying them to the same points in the next period. If you do not have sufficient data for this to work, the default linear regression option will be used as a fallback.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linear Regression Recent WeightedProjections put more weight on recent periods. Use this option if recent periods are more valuable in your data than earlier periods.\u00a0Repeating PatternLets you specify the number for the repeating sequence of data points used in your timeline. For example, a weekly timeline would have a pattern of 7 (for 7 days); a quarterly timeline would have a pattern of 3 (for 3 months); and so on.

This ensures people are receiving notices of\u00a0their tasks and how to manage them.Although we give you a number of recommendations for project and task set up, you should always\u00a0customize projects to your needs. By determining what\u2019s going on around the project, and scope of a\u00a0project, you need to determine how to organize your process so you have a clear understanding of\u00a0what you\u2019re going to execute and how people will follow through on assigned tasks.\nProject Template Types to set up in Domo\nInitiative/Sprint Roadmap\nUse case: Tracks all ongoing and future initiatives.

There are several types of projects\u2014\"Personal Tasks,\" which are tasks you create that are\u00a0only\u00a0seen by you; \"My Projects,\" which are projects to which you are assigned as a team member; and \"Company Projects,\" which are tasks assigned to all teams, whether or not you are a member. Company projects can be made public or private. Public company projects can be viewed, accessed, and edited by anyone in your company, and private company projects can only be viewed by members of the team assigned to that project.\n\nThe page also contains a project named \"Tasks That You Have Assigned,\" which contains all tasks you have assigned to other users. This project contains only the three basic task lists\u2014\"To Do,\" \"Working On,\" and \"Completed.\" Any tasks you have assigned that are in custom-made lists are pulled into the appropriate basic list. (For example, if you had created a list called \"Ideas\" based on the basic \"To Do\" list, the tasks from \"Ideas\" would be pulled into \"To Do\" in the \"Tasks That You Have Assigned\" project.) For more information about lists, see Adding a Task List to a Project.\nAll projects you are able to access in Domo appear in your main\u00a0Projects & Tasks\u00a0page, which you can access by clicking\u00a0\u00a0in the top right corner of the screen.

This document is intended to give you concrete information on this\u00a0fascinating\u00a0topic. To best describe the latest and greatest in publication groups, let\u2019s break down our product functionality and options by use case.\nInternal Publication Groups\nUse Case\nFor internal situations, publication groups function as a filter on data depending on a segment that a particular internal user belongs to. For example, a sales manager may want each salesperson or group to see data for their sales regions or accounts only,\u00a0but doesn\u2019t want to duplicate, modify\u00a0or\u00a0maintain separate pages for each individual. In\u00a0this\u00a0case, each salesperson would be a member of the sales publication group with either privileged or participant level access. \u00a0\nSetup\nSetup is done by navigating to Admin > Pub Groups then selecting pages that should be filtered. From there, you can add and edit relevant data sources based on the use case. Remember that data will be filtered at the row level within that dashboard based on data keys that you select (territory, rep name, or geography as shown in the screenshot).\n\nYou can then add individual\u00a0users\u00a0or\u00a0user\u00a0groups to the publication group and filter their access on the data source columns you\u2019ve selected to\u00a0\u201call\u201d\u00a0or to individual values.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/publication_groups_and_you_the_not_quite_definitive_primer/index.html", "title": "Publication Groups and You: The Not Quite Definitive Primer"}, {"objectID": "e9ca08e22a11-1", "text": "Results\nThe selected pages in the example are filtered at a data source/dataflow level with the appropriate data only. \u00a0In our example, the sales data will filter based on a rep or team column in the data and display the applicable data by team or individual in the cards. It\u2019s important to note that internal publication groups do not take away access to any normal functionality. Page and card features remain the same for all users. \u00a0Users can still perform the all the same actions as expected, such as applying filters on a page, and drilling\u00a0into a card. Buzz, alerts and other functionality are still enabled in the instance for users.\nSales Group A view:\n\nSales Group B view:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/publication_groups_and_you_the_not_quite_definitive_primer/index.html", "title": "Publication Groups and You: The Not Quite Definitive Primer"}, {"objectID": "e9ca08e22a11-2", "text": "A few other important caveats:\nAdministrators will still have access to all the data sources. In our example, if we wanted to limit data source access for users, we would need to ensure that all sales reps had only privileged or participant level access.Publication group access control is different than card access. A user doesn\u2019t get access to cards and data sources that are part of the publication group because publication groups use independent access control. \u00a0I can\u2019t share or copy cards and pages even though I may be admin on the instance.As of this writing, alerts are a challenge with publication groups. Privileged and participant users still have alerts and favorites but these users can\u2019t add alerts themselves to the filtered cards. \u00a0They\u00a0can\u00a0only\u00a0consume alerts that admins create. \u00a0These users would have to go to alerts tab to subscribe if they are following the person who created the alert.\u00a0 Note that the alerting engine does not honor the filtering system at this time. Users that subscribe to any alerts will receive alerts for the whole card\u2019s data set, not just the filtered view.There is no UI indication that a page is filtered through Publication Groups \u2013\u00a0admin may consider\u00a0some indication\u00a0to the user that a given page is filtered through Publication Groups, such as\u00a0\u201cThis page is filtered to show only your sales region\u201d).Users cannot\u00a0reorganize or change the size of cards on a publication group page.\nExternal Publication Groups with SSO (a.k.a. SAAS/SAAS)\nUse Case", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/publication_groups_and_you_the_not_quite_definitive_primer/index.html", "title": "Publication Groups and You: The Not Quite Definitive Primer"}, {"objectID": "e9ca08e22a11-3", "text": "External Publication Groups with SSO (a.k.a. SAAS/SAAS)\nUse Case\nIn this use case, the\u00a0Publication Group is\u00a0used to disseminate tightly controlled information\u00a0to a Domo customer\u2019s own clientele. Common examples include agencies\u00a0or a professional services group.\u00a0Typically, the administrator does not want individual end users, groups, or external clients to be aware of, collaborate,\u00a0or interact with each other. For example, an agency may wish to share a pre-formatted paid search results page with similar cards for all 200 of its end user clients. The agency\u2019s goal would be to allow end user clients to safely and securely log in and consume the real-time data without\u00a0an awareness that other clients exist.\nSetup\nThe only way to completely secure external publication groups is to enable SSO and force end clients to log into Domo through SSO. For clarification, there are two types of SSO:\nAuthentication into Domo through SSOAuthentication into publication groups through SSO (SAAS/SAAS SSO)\nThese are completely separate processes. When we refer to external publication groups SSO, we are referring to the latter. We won\u2019t go into SSO implementation details in this post. However, you can find the setup screen by navigating to Admin > Security > Pub Group SSO (not Single Sign-On).\nResults", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/publication_groups_and_you_the_not_quite_definitive_primer/index.html", "title": "Publication Groups and You: The Not Quite Definitive Primer"}, {"objectID": "e9ca08e22a11-4", "text": "Results\nWhen Publication Groups SSO is properly enabled and configured, the end user/client won\u2019t technically be a user inside of the Domo instance at all. The end client has logged into the\u00a0customername-ss.domo.com\u00a0part of the instance only. \u00a0Therefore, data applicable only to that end user is served in a completely secure and customized manner. End users will not be able to access other end clients\u2019\u00a0data. However, many of the other compelling features of Domo are disabled completely for external publication group participants. End users won\u2019t have access to most normal instance functionality including alerts, favorites and the overview page. Buzz\u00a0and Search are disabled. The end client will only see the designated page(s), and white labeling will happen automatically.\u00a0\nOther details about this use case:\nSSO can handle external groups or emails such as Hotmail, Gmail, etc.Elements used for matching\u00a0users\u00a0within a\u00a0Publication Group:NameDomo user groupEmail\nExternal Publication Groups without SSO (Middle Ground)\nUse Case\nAs often happens, our customers (the agency) may not have viable resources, means or interest to setup and enable an SSO access control program. Domo does have a third option, or middle ground between an internal and secure external use case. \u00a0This third option will hide the UI and evidence of other clients in the instance. If end clients are participant users in an applicable publication group, most of the same functionality as described in use case two still applies, minus a few caveats that will be described below.\nSetup", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/publication_groups_and_you_the_not_quite_definitive_primer/index.html", "title": "Publication Groups and You: The Not Quite Definitive Primer"}, {"objectID": "e9ca08e22a11-5", "text": "Setup\nThe end user/client should be set up as a participant and part of a publication group as mentioned above. The administrator (Domo customer) will also configure filters on the data sources as described above. End clients will still log into a customer-ss.domo.com instance but without SSO authentication. If they are not invited to other cards, pages, and data sources, the UI will be clean. Features like Projects and Tasks, Buzz, and Search will be disabled.\nResults\nThe end user will login to a typical customer-ss.domo.com domain and has access to customized data in the cards/pages that only pertain to that end user. However, in this case, the end user has an actual user account in the instance. Therefore, that end user could still navigate to customer.domo.com and have access to certain Domo features that SSO option prevents. If the end user stays within the bounds of the \u2013ss.domo.com UI and only has participant level access, that end user won\u2019t discover other end users. Projects and Tasks, Buzz, and Search will be disabled. Favorites and Overview pages exist but\u00a0are not editable or configurable by\u00a0end users. Be aware that end users/clients with technically savvy IT groups can find a way around existing safeguards.

This creates a \"bare-bones\" Radial gauge without ranges. You can specify up to six different ranges in a Radial gauge in Chart Properties. For more information, see Understanding Chart Data.\nThe maximum value of a Radial gauge is automatically determined based on the current value. For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200. However, you can set custom minimum and maximum values by specifying ranges. The minimum value of your first range is the minimum value of the gauge, and the maximum value of your last range is the maximum value of the gauge.\nBy default, all of the values in your values column are summed to produce the final value for the chart, even when you select No Aggregation in the value aggregation menu.
