However, in a 100% stacked bar chart, each series bar represents the percentage of the overall category to which it belongs. For example, if a category was composed of three series, one with a value of 100, one of 200, and one of 300, the first series would make up 16.6% of the category (because 100 is equal to 16.6% of 600, the total value of all three series), the second would make up 33%, and the third 50%. In a way, then, a 100% stacked bar chart is also similar to a pie chart, in which each bar corresponds to a pie.\nAs with standard bar charts, both vertical and horizontal versions of 100% stacked bar charts are available.

Most Connectors have two or more associated report types. In addition, many Connectors request a timeframe for the data to be\u00a0retrieved. You may also be asked to submit a query for retrieving data.

To change the aggregation, click a value column header in the pivot table, select Change Aggregate, then choose the desired aggregation type. When you apply an aggregation in Pivot View, the totals reflect the aggregation you have applied, not just the sum of a row or column. For example, if you select Average as your aggregation, the total for each row and column is the average of all the averages in that row or column.\nAvailable aggregations include the following:\nAggregationDescriptionSumShows the sum of each set of grouped rows for a column. This is the default aggregation that is applied to value columns when you choose Group in Column View and to all values in your table in Pivot View.AverageShows the average value for each set of grouped rows for a column.UniqueShows the number of unique items in each set of grouped rows for a column.

When you request to add a filter for a column in your DataSet, Domo automatically determines the data type for that column and provides logical filter options. For example, if you choose to filter a column containing numerical values, the dialog provides \"greater than,\" \"less than,\" and \"between\" options; and if you choose to filter a column with multiple series, the dialog lets you pick one or more series to narrow down to. You can also filter dates using various date filtering criteria.\nApplying Quick Filters\nQuick Filters are pre-defined filters you can use to create a self-guided experience for others to explore data on a Card and answer questions for themselves. When you apply a Quick Filter to a column on a Card, a new pane is added to the Card containing quick filter checkboxes for those columns. Any user who opens the Details view for this Card can then show or hide columns\u00a0quickly and easily just by selecting\u00a0those columns in the Quick Filter pane.\nVideo - Adding Quick Filters in Analyzer\n\n\u00a0\nVideo - Searching in Quick Filters\n\nTo add Quick Filters to a Card,\nOpen the Analyzer for the Card you want to add Quick Filters to.Drag the column you want to provide filters for into the\u00a0Filters\u00a0pane.Turn on the\u00a0Display as Quick Filter\u00a0option.\nFor example, let's say Betty Symington, the creator of the \"Shipping Costs per State\" Card,\u00a0wants to provide users with a quick filter for toggling states in the Card.

Brad could then apply filters for these facets as well.\nWhen you add Quick Filters for string data, you can choose how users select the desired filters. You do this by clicking on the gear menu at the top of the Quick Filter and choosing Match values, Multi select, or Single select. With Match values, users locate the filters they want using search filters\u00a0such as contains, starts with, etc. With Multi select, users check boxes for columns they want to show (as shown in the previous example). They can check the\u00a0Select All\u00a0box to select the boxes for all columns or select this box a second time to clear all the checkboxes. Note that clearing all checkboxes doesn't cause the graph to appear blank; all columns are still shown. Filtering does not occur until you select specific checkboxes. With\u00a0Single select, users select a single filter by clicking radio buttons.

Adobe recommends that you use JWT authentication, as you will have to refresh the OAuth account every two weeks because the OAuth refresh token expires.\n\n\nWhat version of the Adobe Analytics API does this connector use?\nThis connector uses the version 1.4 of the Adobe Analytics API (https://analytics.adobe.io/api/1.4).\n\n\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou need the Client ID (API Key), Client Secret, Technical Account ID, Organization ID, and Private Key associated with your Adobe Analytics 1.4 JWT project.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/adobe_analytics_14_jwt_connector/index.html", "title": "Adobe Analytics 1.4 JWT Connector"}, {"objectID": "bb3168216de4-19", "text": "Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?\nIt is best if your account has Admin access. You at least need access to the report suites you want, as well as access to retrieve elements, metrics, and segments from the API.\n\n\nMy report takes a long time. How do I speed up my report?\nIn case of the Intermediate-Custom report the number of elements selected and the parameters in the Additional Element   text box can make a big difference in your report performance. Select the minimum number of elements needed.It is also possible to have a number of reports queued up in Adobe Analytics that is preventing your report from being finished.

Why is this happening and what can I do about it?\nA: Adobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see\u00a0Adobe documentation for details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username: Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication. Please contact Adobe support to request a resolution to this issue.\nNote: JWT connector which is recommended by Adobe does not need to authenticate after two weeks\n\n\n\nQ: Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?\nA: It is best if your account has the Admin access. At the very least you need access to the report suites you want as well as access to retrieve elements, metrics and segments from the API.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/adobe_analytics_14_oauth_connector/index.html", "title": "Adobe Analytics 1.4 OAuth Connector"}, {"objectID": "a198988fd56b-16", "text": "Q: My Adobe\u00a0Analytics OAuth datasets are failing intermittently and displaying unhelpful error messages like\u00a0\"Unable to complete report at this time.

Unfortunately, it is nothing we at Domo have direct control over, but we are working with\u00a0Adobe\u00a0to improve these types of errors. That said, you can take steps to alleviate the occurrence of these errors, which include reducing the number of connectors, the frequency at which they try to pull data, and the size of their requests. Attempting to schedule requests to run at different times can also help. Another possible solution is to use the \u201cretry\u201d setting in the connector.\n\n\n\nQ: What do I do if I need to include more than 4 elements in my Adobe Analytics OAuth DataSet?\nA: Run Adobe's Data Warehouse reports. These do not use the Domo connector; rather they leverage scheduled emails to import data into Domo. These reports can use SFTP. Note that results may vary slightly from the Adobe Analytics front end.\n\n\n\nQ: My report takes a long time. How do I speed up my report?\nA: In case of the Intermediate-Custom report, the number of elements selected and the parameters in the Additional Element   text box can make a big difference in your report performance.

This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username:Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication.

In addition, the returned Web Services Certificate (which also contains the public key) must be managed properly (stored in the directory that has the matching private key).

These Connectors must also have SSL enabled on their database server in order to authenticate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The federated agent (on-premise deployment) does not require incoming IP allowlisting. See this article for more details on the federated agent architecture: Using the Federated Data Solution.\n\n\n\nAffected Connectors\nAll of the following Connectors require allowlisting:\nAmazon QuickSight SPICEAmazon RedshiftAmazon Redshift AdvancedAmazon Redshift SSHApache KafkaApache Kafka RESTCSV AdvancedCSV SFTP PullCventGitHub EnterpriseHiveJiraJSON AdvancedIBM DB2IBM InformixIBM Informix SSHMicrosoft Excel SFTPMicrosoft SQL ServerMongoDBMySQLMySQL SSHOracle DatabaseOracle Database SSHPostgreSQLPostgreSQL SSHSAP Adaptive Server EnterpriseSAP Adaptive Server Enterprise SSHServiceNowSplunkVertica\nIP Addresses to Allowlist\nImportant: The IPs listed below must be allowlisted on your database server. You should not add these IPs to the allowlist in your Domo instance. Doing so will simply lock everyone out of the instance who is not coming from the IP addresses listed below. If you add these IPs to the allowlist in your Domo instance rather than on your server, incoming users will receive an error upon trying to log in that says \"We're sorry but the system is not performing right now.\"\nIf a Domo Connector or federated adapter need access to your servers, you will need to allowlist all of the following IPs in the section below corresponding to where your Domo instance is hosted.
