You do this by clicking\u00a0  then selecting the new chart. In contrast to the chart type picker in Analyzer, which only shows icons for each chart type, the Details view chart type picker shows you actual thumbnail versions of each available chart type with your chart data applied. So, for example, if you opened the Details page for the following Vertical Stacked Bar chart...\u00a0\n\u00a0\n...you could then open the chart type picker and selectable thumbnails of your chart, all powered by your chart data, would appear, as follows:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe original chart type for your chart is always shown in the top left corner of the chart type picker with a gray curved arrow. If you want to switch back to that chart type, you can do so quickly by clicking this thumbnail.\nThe chart type picker only displays thumbnails for chart types that are compatible with your data. In the previous example, \"Scatter Plot\" is not suggested as a chart type because Scatter Plots have a different data structure than Vertical Stacked Bars (i.e. two value columns instead of one).

Instead of executing the visualization query against Domo, the query is executed at the target database and the results are sent to Domo to render the visualization. This model is especially relevant for users who would like to keep their data at rest within their infrastructure for security or logistical reasons.\nBenefits\nPreserves existing data warehouse investment by allowing for direct connection to customer data lakes and warehouses.No upload to cloud storage.\nAvoids data duplication and costly data transfers.Reduces data latency due to transfers.Domo supports most commonly available databases. See the FAQ's for our current list.Customer admins retain control of the data.Custom database optimizations can be performed by the customer.\nDrawbacks\nBefore using Domo's Federated Data solution, be aware of the following:\nQuery performance depends on the configuration of the customer\u2019s data warehouse, its performance profile and the query load it experiences.

Upsert is a type of SQL merge that can be used to dramatically increase the performance of data ingestion in certain use cases. To use this update method, you must have a key, either primary or composite,\u00a0to uniquely\u00a0identify each row of data. Additionally, there must be a method to identify the subset of rows to send to Domo, such as a where clause in an ODBC job. Once the subset of\u00a0rows is identified, Domo will compare the\u00a0key column(s) to determine if the row already exists in your DataSet and update those existing records. Rows that do not exist will be appended.\nUpsert\u00a0typically works best when the DataSet is very large, the data is updating frequently, and the data contains a unique primary or composite key. Any efficiency gained by using upsert is realized when instead of sending all rows, only the new or updated rows are sent. Proper use of upsert can have significant positive impacts on performance and efficiency of your Workbench job as well as requiring fewer resources on your database or file storage system. Improper use can negatively impact performance and run time.\nHow to Use Upsert\nTo use the upsert function in Workbench, you should already have an existing Workbench job and a healthy DataSet in Domo. For more information on how to create a Workbench job, see\u00a0Creating a Job in Workbench 5.1.\nNavigate to the\u00a0Configure\u00a0tab.Set the\u00a0Update Method\u00a0to\u00a0Append.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If this is a NEW Workbench job, you must run the job for the first time on Replace to create the DataSet.

You do this by building a U.S. State map or a U.S. County map. These\u00a0are nearly the same, with one important difference. U.S. County maps show County data on the\u00a0national\u00a0level\u2014that is, your County data appears on a map of the entire United States (though you can add a\u00a0drilldown\u00a0allowing users to jump to individual states). U.S. State maps, on the other hand, automatically zoom in on the State indicated in your DataSet, allowing you to build maps for individual States.\u00a0\nBoth U.S. State and U.S. County maps require a column or row containing the FIPS codes representing each County and another containing the values for each such County. A FIPS code is a five-digit number that identifies Counties and County equivalents in the United States, certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated States. The first two digits are the FIPS State code and the last three are the County code within the State or possession. For example, the FIPS State code for Florida is 12, and the FIPS County code for Miami-Dade County is 086, so to represent Miami-Dade County in your DataSet you would use the number \"12086.\"\nYou can find FIPS codes for any U.S. county by setting up the Domo Dimensions Connector using the following steps:\nNavigate to the Appstore.Type Domo Dimensions into the Search bar.Select the Domo Dimensions Connector.  Click Get the data.Select the zips_to_fips_latest.csv file.Click Next.Name the DataSet.Click Save.Join the Domo Dimensions DataSet you just created to your data on the Zip column.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/us_state_and_county_maps/index.html", "title": "U.S. State and County Maps"}, {"objectID": "2bf19c717b2f-1", "text": "Tip: In Domo, maps are generated based on the existing data you provide. When building a U.S. State map, you can use ZIP codes instead of FIPS codes. Your map will then automatically switch to a ZIP code-level map. If a column name includes \"st\" (short for \"state\") the state-level map will load. If the column name in the ETL is \"zip2fip,\" the zipcode-level map will load. When using the US counties map, you can use either ZIP codes or FIPS codes in the county selector. Domo will try and match FIPS or ZIPS by matching column name clues like \"Zip\" or \"zip code\". It will try \"FIPS\" or \"county\" for the county column name.\n\n\n\nIf you want to build a U.S. State map and your DataSet includes information for multiple States, you can select the State you want to show by applying a filter.\u00a0\nValues in your U.S. State or U.S. County map are represented by varying shades of color, each of which corresponds to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet and are represented by a legend, which is automatically included beside the map.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: When multiple instances of a single region occur in a DataSet, the values for that region are summed to show a single value for the region in the map.

There are several kinds of Default Controls, such as dropdowns, pills, sliders, and textbox inputs. The kind of Default Control you can use with a Variable depends on the data type of the Variable.\nYou can configure a Default Control when you create a Variable or come back later to add it by editing your Variable.\nIf you change the default value for a Variable after creating the Default Control, the Default Control does not update automatically. To change the Default Control, you must make a change to it in the Beast Mode Editor and save the change.\nDefault Control and Other Users\nIf you create a Variable without a Default Control and return to add one later, or if you initially configure the Variable with a Default Control and later update it, your changes do not override the different controls other users may have created or modified as they use your Variable in their cards and dashboards.

Waffle charts provide a new, simple and intuitive way to visualize data as it includes many customizable settings to tell a more informative story. Other gauge types in Domo include single value gauges, radial gauges, face gauges, and comparative fill gauges.\nPowering Waffle Gauges\nA Waffle Gauge requires only one column or row of data from your DataSet\u2014the Gauge Value that contains current values. The other option is an Optional Max Value that you intend for your data to achieve.\u00a0For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIf multiple rows are present in your DataSet, the values in all of the rows are aggregated. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the target value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for \"Team A\" that both had a target value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new target value of 200. Selecting No Aggregation for either the current value or maximum does not currently work.\nUnless you add a column to the Optional Max Value, the maximum value of a Waffle Gauge is automatically determined based on the current value. For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200.\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Waffle Gauge.

Profits appear as green bars, losses appear as red bars, and start and summary bars appear as blue bars.\nVertical and horizontal subtypes are available for Waterfall charts.\nPowering Waterfall Charts\nA Waterfall chart requires three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for series (generally dates), and one for values. The series data in your DataSet determines the order of the categories (for example, if your series data consisted of dates, the category bars would be arranged by date) but by default only appears when you mouse over a bar to show the hover text. However, you can show summary bars for individual series by checking a box in Chart Properties. For more information, see Customizing Waterfall Charts.\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Waterfall chart.

The screenshot shows an example of this, in which a summary column is provided for the bars for each individual date. Because the dates appear only on mouse-over, this is a good way of making the series for each date more distinguishable.General > Summary TextLets you specify the text that appears below the summary bars. In the example, the user has replaced the word \"Summary\" with the word \"Total.\"\nAdvanced Demo\nWaterfall charts can be powerful tools for showing data, especially sales pipeline use case data. They can help you answer questions such as \"What was our sales pipeline at the beginning and end of the quarter, and what changed in between?\" and \"I know the values in my pipeline changed, but why?\" However, these charts can also be very challenging to build. We present this step-by-step demo to help you through all of the steps in building an effective waterfall chart.\nPrerequisites\nTo follow this demo,\u00a0you will need 2 DataSets\u2014one with the\u00a0snapshot data for the starting point of the sales opportunity and another with the snapshot data for the ending point of that opportunity. Both DataSets should be filtered to the snapshot date (BATCH_LAST_RUN usually works) and should contain the following information:\nOpportunity IDStatus or stageAmountsAnticipated close date", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/waterfall_chart/index.html", "title": "Waterfall Chart"}, {"objectID": "c74d0b3b261a-2", "text": "Part\u00a01 - Joining the DataSets\nStart a new MySQL DataFlow\u00a0in the Data Center.Add the 2 DataSets\u00a0(the beginning and ending snapshot DataSets\u00a0mentioned in the prerequisites) as input DataSets in your DataFlow.  \u00a0Add a transform in which you join the DataSets using a FULL OUTER JOIN (see the below screenshot for a code example).Use a LEFT JOIN on both DataSets.Include an ifnull\u00a0statement on the \"Opportunity ID\" to make sure it's populated.\u00a0Include a where statement in which you filter to where the opportunity ID is null.Give labels to\u00a0each of the key dimensional columns to indicate whether they are\u00a0at the beginning or end of the period. For example, if you had a column called \"Amount\"\u00a0in\u00a0your starting point DataSet, you would include the line ob. `Amount` as `Beginning Amount`, in the MySQL.\u00a0\u00a0 Generate an output DataSet.  Once you have done a successful\u00a0FULL OUTER JOIN, you should have a new DataSet with one row for every opportunity. Each row should provide information for both the beginning and end snapshot dates, including the status, amount, and close date. The DataSet should look something like the following:   This DataSet\u00a0becomes the basis for all the buckets you render in the waterfall chart.\nPart 2 - Building the Buckets", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/waterfall_chart/index.html", "title": "Waterfall Chart"}, {"objectID": "c74d0b3b261a-3", "text": "Part 2 - Building the Buckets\nStart a new MySQL DataFlow\u00a0in the Data Center.Add the DataSet you created in part 1\u00a0as the input DataSet\u00a0in your DataFlow.For the transform, create a query for each bucket you want to render in your chart.\u00a0Give each bucket a hard-coded column called \"Bucket\" and enter the label for whatever that subset of data ties to.\u00a0  In the below example, each query returns opportunities that make up the beginning pipeline.\u00a0 Include a union all statement after each bucket section. (UNIONs are recommended because it is possible an opportunity may fall into more than one bucket.)Generate an output DataSet.\u00a0\nPart 3 - Building the Card\nBuild your Waterfall card in Analyzer, making sure to assign columns as follows:Summary Group - \"Bucket\" columnItem Names -\u00a0\"Bucket\" columnValue -\u00a0The column with your amount data (use the default SUM aggregation)\nThis will give you a Waterfall chart showing your beginning and ending points with all increases and decreases in between.\nPart 4 - Validating\nWith a Waterfall card, all of the positive amounts should be equal to the negative amounts, i.e. they should have a net of 0. If your values are not balanced, the chart will display a \"Summary Ending Pipeline\" value that tells you the discrepancy in the data. In the following example, the positive and negative amounts are off by $1000. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n This indicates there is an issue in the data you need to fix.

By sorting, it is easy to identify the problem opportunity.\u00a0You can then look at the other columns to see if there has been any activity contributing to this discrepancy.

For information about changing the owner of a DataSet, see Changing the Owner of a DataSet. \u00a0\n\n\n\nYou create a webform DataSet\u00a0by manually entering your data into a form provided by Domo and uploading the form. If you are uploading the DataSet\u00a0via the page view rather than through the Data Center or Appstore, you can then determine the chart's visual characteristics as discussed in Analyzer Overview.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\u00a0The data you enter in the webform must be column-based; otherwise, you may experience problems (such as selecting columns or editing your data).

You can edit this name later by opening the webform in the Data Center and choosing to edit the name and description OR choosing to edit the webform itself.\u00a0Search and replaceProvides options for searching for and replacing text. When you enter a term in the Search field, all cells in the webform containing that search term highlight. After entering a search term, you can then click  to open a dialog with options for replacing the search term. In the Replace field, you enter the term to replace your specified search term. For example, if you wanted to replace the name \"Christina\" with \"Kristina,\" you would first enter Christina as the search term. You would then click\u00a0\u00a0to open the Replace dialog and enter Kristina as the replacement term.\u00a0\nThe Replace dialog contains two additional options you may find useful. The first of these, Match case, allows you to ensure that case is factored into your search. For example, if you wanted to change all instances of \"green\" to \"red\" but didn't want to affect instances of the surname \"Green,\" you could enter green as your search term and red as your replacement term and check the Match case box.

Then all instances of \"Value\" without \"Fries\" would change to \"Amount\" and all instances of \"Value Fries\" would remain the same.New column buttonLets you add a new column to the webform.

Domo attempts to determine the data type automatically when you add values or import data, but you can turn off this automatic auto detection by unchecking Auto Detect.\nIf a red line appears after the data type, this indicates that there are values in the column that do not match the selected data type.

To see this article for Workbench 5, click here.\n\n\n\nIntro\n\nGet answers to frequently asked questions about Workbench.\n\nWhat is Workbench?\nWorkbench is a Windows-based application that lets you upload DataSets to Domo.\nYou can upload data from databases via data queries in ODBC System DSNs, CSV and delimited text files, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Jira, QuickBooks, and XML namespaces.You can upload data manually or through scheduled jobs.Workbench validates data and securely transfers data to Domo.\n\n\u00a0\nCan Workbench update or make any changes to our original data?\nNo, it does not modify your original data.\u00a0Workbench is designed to read and transmit data to Domo. Workbench does let you modify the data going in to Domo through transforms, calculations, and joins.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:  For database connections only, if your ODBC driver supports read/write, any queries you pass into your database can be considered a \u201cwrite.\u201d For example, temp tables, inserts, or deletes are entirely possible with Workbench and database connections. Consider using read-only credentials for your database connections if there is cause for concern.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-1", "text": "What type of encryption does Workbench use to transmit data?\nAll data transferred from Workbench into Domo\u2019s production systems is sent using encrypted HTTPS sessions, the same technology you typically use to conduct online banking and online purchases. No data is sent from Workbench to Domo in an unencrypted manner.\nIf access credentials cannot be stored as part of the Windows DSN, how are those credentials stored?\nWorkbench stores access credentials for ODBC DataSets. To properly protect these credentials, Workbench uses industry standard AES-256 bit encryption. Workbench enforces encryption automatically so users do not have the opportunity of mistakenly storing their passwords or other credentials inappropriately.\nHow are access controls configured for Workbench?\nWorkbench is configured by the client from an access control perspective. Workbench allows users to upload DataSets into Domo to enable KPI card creation and automated updates. Users select DataSets (System DSNs, flat files, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, JIRA, QuickBooks, XML namespaces) to which they already have access. Workbench can connect to DataSets only if the Microsoft Windows system running the software can reach the DataSet, and if the machine has access to read the DataSet files or databases.\nIs any of the data transmitted by Workbench cached on the local machine?\nWorkbench uses a temp directory (C:\\Windows\\Temp\\DomoCache) to stage incoming data. If you have many DataSet Jobs with a large number of rows, this temp directory can fill up with a large amount of data. Make sure the C:\\ drive has a reasonable amount of free space for these files. These files are cleared when the job is complete and are not permanently stored.\nDo you support Windows 32 and 64-bit versions?\nYes, both 32 and 64-bit Windows versions are supported.\u00a0For more system requirements information, see\u00a0Installing Workbench 4.\nAre 32-bit ODBC connections supported?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-2", "text": "Are 32-bit ODBC connections supported?\nYes. Workbench concurrently supports both 32- and 64-bit ODBC drivers.\nWhat is the maximum size of a DataSet\u00a0that Workbench supports?\nWorkbench limits uploading to 50 million rows for a single upload job. You can use a lastvalue variable to upload rows incrementally. For more information about query parameters, see Understanding the Workbench 4 User Interface.\nYou can check the size of your data by clicking Validate Data.\nCan Workbench run from a command line?\nYes, Workbench can be executed directly from a command line and/or added as a task in an ETL package.\nFor more information about running Workbench from the command line, see Running Workbench 4 from the command line.\nHow can I improve the performance of a MySQL driver?\nWhen using a MySQL driver, you can decrease its memory usage and improve its performance by configuring parameters for the DSN.\nTo configure your MySQL DSN,\nOpen the the Windows ODBC Data\u00a0Source Administrator by entering \"ODBC\" in the Start Menu search, then selecting \"Data\u00a0Sources (ODBC)\".Select your DSN, then click Configure.Click Details to display additional settings.In the Connection tab, mark the Allow big result sets box.When selected, the driver does not set packet limits for results.In the Cursors/Results tab, mark the Don\u2019t cache results of forward-only cursors box and the Force use of forward-only cursors box.When selected, the driver does not cache results and uses forward-only cursors.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-3", "text": "Note:\u00a0Workbench does not need anything other than \"forward only\" cursors and the MySQL ODBC driver performs better using the \"forward only\" cursors option.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-4", "text": "How do I get access to network files to run a scheduled job?\nWhen running a job on a schedule, if the file is not located on the local machine\u00a0Workbench is running on, you must set up impersonation for access rights.\nTo set up impersonation,\nOpen Settings for the intended job.Under Settings > Impersonation, turn on Requires Impersonation.Enter the Domain and Username information.Click Validate.\nIf you are connecting to a file on a domain file share that the Workbench computer is not on, the domain impersonation will not work if you are not on the domain computer.

If a job is already in the queue, the queue will not allow it to be queued again until the running job completes\u00a0or the Domo Workbench service is restarted.The current job could be in a non-responsive state. If a job is running longer than expected, open a case with Domo Support to investigate the issue further. For information on how to contact Support, please see: Getting Help.Recreating a job with a different name and deleting the previous job that is stuck in the queue is one way to reset the queue.

You cannot enter your proxy settings manually at this time. However, after your initial connection, you can then enter proxy settings manually in the Settings > Proxy tab.\nCan I save Workbench jobs to a shared folder? I want multiple users to be able to access and edit the jobs, but I can't figure out where jobs are saved on the drive.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-7", "text": "All Workbench jobs are saved in the cloud and tied to a specific login, not saved locally. Therefore, the recommended solution to this problem is to install Workbench on a common server then create an admin user to be used by all users who need to modify jobs. Thus, all these users will be able to access the jobs, and you will not need to worry about saving copies of the job on a physical drive. A benefit specific to Workbench 4 is that users with access to the server can use Workbench simultaneously.\u00a0\nCan I share Workbench jobs?\nJobs are tied to the Workbench installation in which they were created. If you wanted to share a job, you would need to export that job on the Workbench installation in which it was created then import it into the second installation of Workbench.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-8", "text": "Note:\u00a0It is not recommended to have the same job running on two different instances of Workbench at the same time.

Input your query and run a \u201cPreview\u201d to run a true connection validation.\nDoes Workbench throttle CPU usage?\nNot by default, but Workbench 4.51 does have this as a configurable option.\nWhere does Workbench store staging data by default? And can I move this staging data?\nThe data is stored in C:\\Window\\Temp\\DomoCache. Currently you cannot move the staging folder.\nThe schedule group \u201cexisting schedule\u201d radio button is grayed out---what do I do?\nClose Workbench and open it as an Administrator.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-10", "text": "Close Workbench and open it as an Administrator.\nHow do I get the list of table names or stored procedures on my database?\nThe query builder is in the Source pane.

Why is this?\nEnsure your Windows username is not the same as the PC name. Windows 10 appears to enforce this. Older versions of Windows may also be impacted.\nMy QuickBooks Workbench jobs will not run on schedule. What do I do?\nYou must be logged into Windows with an active session for QuickBooks integrated applications to run unattended.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-11", "text": "What do I do if the Unsafe Save dialog appears?\nThe \"Unsafe Save\" dialog is displayed when your local job configuration and the remote job configuration stored in Domo do not match up or the job is currently running. To prevent the loss of data, you must first wait for the job to finish if it\u2019s running, then re-sync your local configuration with Domo. This can be done by either clicking Revert or pressing F5 on your keyboard to refresh your entire job list. Unfortunately you will lose any changes that you have made when you take either of these actions. If your job runs long enough or frequently enough that you constantly see this dialog when attempting to make changes, you likely need to temporarily turn off the Workbench service, make your changes, then re-enable the service to start running your newly modified job.\nMy IT department requires a whitelist for all outgoing internet traffic from our network. Does Domo have an IP whitelist for purposes of running Workbench?\nDomo Support can provide you with an IP to whitelist. Note that although unlikely, the IP can change at any moment and without notice, resulting in Workbench job failures. It is advised that you whitelist by DNS name if possible. (e.g. instance.domo.com).\nIs there a way to move my DomoCache directory to a different disk drive?\nThe current version of Workbench doesn't allow you to separate the operating system from the application data, but you can work around this issue using hard-coded symbolic links. The following example\u00a0shows how a user moved his DomoCache directory to the E: drive:\nmklink\u00a0/J \"C:\\ProgramData\\Domo\\Workbench\\DomoCache\" \"E:\\Domo\\Workbench\\DomoCache\"\nWhat limitations exist for self-serve accounts?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "29b778f76b4b-12", "text": "What limitations exist for self-serve accounts?\nSelf-serve users have a limitation of one auto-run per day and one manual run per hour.

Please consider regularly checking and upgrading to the latest version wherever possible. This will help you receive the best possible experience with Domo Workbench.\nWhat version am I using right now?\nYou may be wondering which version you\u2019re using now. You may also be asked by Domo Support to identify the version to provide customized support. There should be a blue icon in the system tray. If you hover over that icon, the version will be displayed.\nIf you don\u2019t see the blue icon, try clicking this up arrow first . Alternatively, the version number will also be contained within the Workbench log files. (The default location for Workbench 4 log files is\u00a0%PROGRAMDATA%\\Domo\\Workbench\\Logs).\n\n\n \n\n\nNote: You may see multiple Workbench monitors in the system tray.

The following tips will help you manage your computer.\nLimiting\u00a0the number of jobs that can run at the same time\nChoosing this option limits how many jobs are running at a time. In this instance, jobs will wait in a queue until a slot is opened for them to run.\nUnder Settings, turn on\u00a0Limit Concurrent Jobs.Select the limit for Workbench jobs.\nRunning Workbench jobs below normal priority execution\nIf you find that your Workbench Machine is using a lot of CPU, you can free up CPU for other applications by running the Workbench jobs at Below Normal Priority. This will limit the resources Workbench uses to execute your jobs and allow other applications to run normally. Typically, job execution will slow slightly.\nUnder Settings, turn on\u00a0Set data collector process to Below Normal Priority.\nCanceling a currently running job\nThere are a number of reasons you may want to stop a Workbench job. It may be that you encounter a long running query, or a job may be stuck in an error state.\u00a0In this case, you can cancel the job.\n\u00a0\nSelect the job you want to stop.Click the purple Cancel\u00a0button at the top.\n\u00a0\nManually running a job\nIf you want to update your data outside of the normal schedule, you can run the job manually.\nSelect the job you would like to run.Click the purple Run\u00a0button at the top.\nTopic #3: When and how to use impersonation\nWhat is impersonation?\u00a0Impersonation allows Workbench to run jobs as a specified user\u00a0to allow access to restricted resources.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_4_training_topics/index.html", "title": "Workbench 4 Training Topics"}, {"objectID": "827b4e17c38b-3", "text": "When should I use impersonation?\u00a0When running a job on a schedule, if the file is not located on the local machine\u00a0Workbench is running on, you must set up impersonation for access rights.\nConnecting to a network file.\u00a0When you connect\u00a0to a file that is stored on a network location, the file is usually only accessible to a few users.

You can still use the generic plugins to connect to your database.\nWhat are the benefits of using the database specific plugins?\nWorkbench will read the datatypes directly from the database meaning you do not have to worry that Workbench will interpret the data type differently than your database.\nWhat DataSets can I take over?\nAny DataSets that were created by a Connector and for which you have Edit permissions or above.\nCan I transfer it back to the Connector if I change my mind?\nNo, moving DataSets from Workbench 5.1 back to a Connector is currently not supported.\nWill the DataSet automatically start using the schedule from the Connector?\nNo, you will need to set up a new job in Workbench 5.1 and set up the schedule you would like to use in Workbench 5.1, and then choose the DataSet.\nWhat if I accidentally bulk delete multiple jobs?\nWorkbench 5.1 has added an extra confirm step so you can ensure you would like to delete DataSets. Once they have been deleted, they cannot be recovered.\nHave any actions been excluded from the Bulk Action menu?\nNo, any actions that can be configured on a job can also be adjusted using the Bulk Actions menu.\nCan I edit DataSets from different providers at the same time?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_51/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5.1"}, {"objectID": "9516706dcf72-16", "text": "Can I edit DataSets from different providers at the same time?\nFor some Bulk Action options, Workbench 5.1 will ask you to choose which provider jobs you would like to update first because the configuration steps are often different between providers.\nWill I be able to block all schema changes?\nYes, when this option is selected, absolutely no schema changes will be allowed and Workbench 5.1 will automatically fail the job.\nCan I choose to prevent schema changes on some columns and allow them on others?\nYes, the new protect column allows you to choose which columns will have schema protection and which ones will not. This option is not available when Block all schema changes\u00a0is selected.\nIf I add a new column to my DataSet will that fail the job?\nIt depends, if you choose to Allow safe schema changes, Workbench 5.1 will prevent schema changes on existing columns while allowing new columns to be added to the DataSet.\nWhat date grains are available for partitioning?\nPartitioning will be available for all column types.\nCan I convert an existing DataSet to a partitioned DataSet?\nPartitioning is only available on new DataSets in this version.

If your desired language is not available, the default language will be English.\nIf you would like Workbench in a language not shown in the list above, please contact Domo Support.\nWhat type of encryption does Workbench use to transmit data?\nAll data transferred from Workbench into Domo\u2019s production systems is sent using encrypted HTTPS sessions, the same technology you typically use to conduct online banking and online purchases. No data is sent from Workbench to Domo in an unencrypted manner.\nIf access credentials cannot be stored as part of the Windows DSN, how are those credentials stored?\nWorkbench stores access credentials for ODBC DataSets. To properly protect these credentials, Workbench uses industry standard AES-256 bit encryption or RSA encryption with a key stored locally on your computer (depending on the length of data being encrypted)\u00a0. Workbench enforces encryption automatically so users do not have the opportunity of mistakenly storing their passwords or other credentials inappropriately.\nHow are access controls configured for Workbench?\nWorkbench is configured by the client from an access control perspective. Workbench allows users to upload DataSets into Domo to enable KPI card creation and automated updates. Users select DataSets (System DSNs, flat files, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, JIRA, QuickBooks,\u00a0JSON, XML namespaces) to which they already have access. Workbench can connect to DataSets only if the Microsoft Windows system running the software can reach the DataSet, and if the machine has access to read the DataSet files or databases.\nIs any of the data transmitted by Workbench cached on the local machine?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_51_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5.1 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "3050324b3dd2-2", "text": "Is any of the data transmitted by Workbench cached on the local machine?\nWorkbench uses a temp directory (%PROGRAMDATA%\\Domo\\Workbench\\DomoCache) to stage incoming data.

I want multiple users to be able to access and edit the jobs, but I can't figure out where jobs are saved on the drive.\nAll Workbench jobs are saved in the cloud and tied to a specific login, not saved locally. Therefore, the recommended solution to this problem is to install Workbench on a common server then create an admin user to be used by all users who need to modify jobs. Thus, all these users will be able to access the jobs, and you will not need to worry about saving copies of the job on a physical drive. Although multiple users can use Workbench simultaneously, only the first opened instance will get the live updates from the Workbench service. We generally do not recommend having multiple instances of Workbench open because of multiple people have the same job open and are making changes, the last person to save will overwrite all other changes.\u00a0\nCan I share Workbench jobs?\nJobs are tied to the Workbench installation in which they were created.

By splitting a large table into smaller and individual tables, queries that access only a fraction of the data can run faster because there is less data to scan.\nThe main goal of partitioning is to aid in the maintenance of large tables and to reduce the overall response time to read and load the data for specific operations. Partitioning enables faster query execution and distribution of files over multiple storage devices.\nThis version of Workbench 5.1 Partition Support divides your DataSet into sections based on day, month, or year, and then anytime you add new data from one of those sections, Workbench 5.1 replaces that section with new data.\nSetting up partition support in Domo\nAs you create a new job in Domo Workbench 5.1, you need to specify the Update method as Partition\u00a0while configuring the job to set up the partition support for that job.\nCreating a job with partition support in Workbench 5.1\nYou can upload data from external data sources to Domo after specifying connection and data information as a job, which you can save and use again.\nCreating a DataSet job in Workbench 5.1:\nIn the DataSet\u00a0Jobs pane, click the +\u00a0icon to create a new job.Specify the basic settings for the job, such as the DataSet job name, the method of data transport (such as Local File Provider, ODBC Connection Provider, etc.), the data reader (data source) type (such as JIRA, Excel, etc.), the DataSet name and type, and an optional DataSet description.\n\n\n \n\nNote: The DataSet name is the only setting you can change after creating the job.

The following tips will help you manage your computer.\nLimiting\u00a0the Number of Jobs that Can Run at the Same Time\nChoosing this option limits how many jobs are running at a time. In this instance, jobs will wait in a queue until a slot is opened for them to run.\nUnder Settings, turn on\u00a0Limit Concurrent Jobs.Select the limit for Workbench jobs.\nRunning Workbench Jobs Below Normal Priority Execution\nIf you find that your Workbench Machine is using a lot of CPU, you can free up CPU for other applications by running the Workbench jobs at Below Normal Priority. This will limit the resources Workbench uses to execute your jobs and allow other applications to run normally. Typically, job execution will slow slightly.\nUnder Settings, turn on Run job process as\u00a0Below Normal priority.\nCanceling a Currently Running Job\nThere are a number of reasons you may want to stop a Workbench job. It may be that you encounter a long running query, or a job may be stuck in an error state.\u00a0In this case, you can cancel the job.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_51_training_topics/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5.1 Training Topics"}, {"objectID": "2a66c9d10195-3", "text": "Open the preview pane for the job you want to stop.Click the \u00a0button at the top.\nManually Running a Job\nIf you want to update your data outside of the normal schedule, you can run the job manually.\nIn the Jobs list, open\u00a0the job you would like to run.Click the \u00a0button at the top.\u00a0\nTopic #3: When and How to Use Impersonation\nWhat is impersonation?\u00a0Impersonation allows Workbench to run jobs as a specified user\u00a0to allow access to restricted resources.\nWhen should I use impersonation?\u00a0When running a job on a schedule, if the file is not located on the local machine\u00a0Workbench is running on, you must set up impersonation for access rights.\nConnecting to a network file.\u00a0When you connect\u00a0to a file that is stored on a network location, the file is usually only accessible to a few users. When you turn on on impersonation, the Workbench job will run as the user specified, allowing access to the file.\nConnecting to an ODBC/OLAP connection that requires NT Authentication.\u00a0When you connect\u00a0to a database that uses NT Authentication, the database tables\u00a0are usually only accessible to a limited number of users. By turning on impersonation, the Workbench job will run as the specified user, allowing access to the database.\nQuickBooks jobs.\u00a0QuickBooks requires an interactive user session for Workbench to connect. Workbench will use the impersonation credentials to find the correct user session. This will allow your QuickBooks jobs to run consistently.\nConnecting through a proxy.\u00a0Some proxies restrict access to the Internet by user. When you turn on impersonation, the Workbench job will run as the specified user, allowing access to the Internet through the proxy server.\nTurning On Impersonation", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_51_training_topics/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5.1 Training Topics"}, {"objectID": "2a66c9d10195-4", "text": "Turning On Impersonation\nIn the Configure\u00a0subtab for the job, expand the Impersonation\u00a0section, then turn on\u00a0Requires Impersonation.Enter the\u00a0Domain\u00a0and\u00a0Username and Password\u00a0information.Click\u00a0Validate.\nTopic #4: What To Do When Workbench Jobs Are Failing at a Fixed Interval\nYou may find that a Job runs for a specific number of minutes and then fails each time.\nTo fix this problem, \nCheck the logs for the Job.Find the point in the logs at which the query starts (look for the query string), and make note of the time stamp.Go down the log to the point of the error and find the time stamp there.Compare the difference.\nIf it\u2019s five minutes, then there is a good chance that the execution query time needs to be increased in your Workbench Job because it is taking longer than five minutes to be passed.

Workbench does let you modify the data going in to Domo through transforms, calculations, and joins.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:  For database connections only, if your ODBC driver supports read/write, any queries you pass into your database can be considered a \u201cwrite.\u201d For example, temp tables, inserts, or deletes are entirely possible with Workbench and database connections. Consider using read-only credentials for your database connections if there is cause for concern.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_5_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "6d5418256c4f-1", "text": "What languages are available in Workbench?\nWorkbench is available in all of the same languages the Domo product is available in. As of May 2019, these include the following:\nEnglishJapaneseFrenchGermanSpanishChinese\nWorkbench syncs automatically with the user language set on your machine. If your desired language is not available, the default language will be English.\nIf you would like Workbench in a language not shown in the list above, please contact Domo Support.\nWhat type of encryption does Workbench use to transmit data?\nAll data transferred from Workbench into Domo\u2019s production systems is sent using encrypted HTTPS sessions, the same technology you typically use to conduct online banking and online purchases. No data is sent from Workbench to Domo in an unencrypted manner.\nIf access credentials cannot be stored as part of the Windows DSN, how are those credentials stored?\nWorkbench stores access credentials for ODBC DataSets. To properly protect these credentials, Workbench uses industry standard AES-256 bit encryption or RSA encryption with a key stored locally on your computer (depending on the length of data being encrypted)\u00a0. Workbench enforces encryption automatically so users do not have the opportunity of mistakenly storing their passwords or other credentials inappropriately.\nHow are access controls configured for Workbench?\nWorkbench is configured by the client from an access control perspective. Workbench allows users to upload DataSets into Domo to enable KPI card creation and automated updates. Users select DataSets (System DSNs, flat files, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, JIRA, QuickBooks,\u00a0JSON, XML namespaces) to which they already have access. Workbench can connect to DataSets only if the Microsoft Windows system running the software can reach the DataSet, and if the machine has access to read the DataSet files or databases.\nIs any of the data transmitted by Workbench cached on the local machine?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_5_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "6d5418256c4f-2", "text": "Is any of the data transmitted by Workbench cached on the local machine?\nWorkbench uses a temp directory (%PROGRAMDATA%\\Domo\\Workbench\\DomoCache) to stage incoming data. If you have many DataSet Jobs with a large number of rows, this temp directory can fill up with a large amount of data. Make sure the C:\\ drive has a reasonable amount of free space for these files. These files are cleared when the job is complete and are not permanently stored.\nDo you support Windows 32 and 64-bit versions?\nYes, both 32 and 64-bit Windows versions are supported.\u00a0For more system requirements information, see\u00a0Installing Workbench 5.\nAre 32-bit ODBC connections supported?\nYes. Workbench concurrently supports both 32- and 64-bit ODBC drivers.\nWhat is the maximum size of a DataSet\u00a0that Workbench supports?\nWorkbench has no row limit for a single upload job. You can use a lastvalue variable to upload rows incrementally. For more information about query parameters, see Understanding the Workbench 5\u00a0User Interface.\nCan Workbench run from a command line?\nYes, Workbench can be executed directly from a command line and/or added as a task in an ETL package.\nFor more information about running Workbench from the command line, see Running Workbench\u00a0from the command line.\nHow can I improve the performance of a MySQL driver?\nWhen using a MySQL driver, you can decrease its memory usage and improve its performance by configuring parameters for the DSN.\nTo configure your MySQL DSN,", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_5_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "6d5418256c4f-3", "text": "To configure your MySQL DSN,\nOpen the the Windows ODBC Data\u00a0Source Administrator by entering \"ODBC\" in the Start Menu search, then selecting \"Data\u00a0Sources (ODBC)\".Select your DSN, then click Configure.Click Details to display additional settings.In the Connection tab, mark the Allow big result sets box.When selected, the driver does not set packet limits for results.In the Cursors/Results tab, mark the Don\u2019t cache results of forward-only cursors box and the Force use of forward-only cursors box.When selected, the driver does not cache results and uses forward-only cursors.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_5_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "6d5418256c4f-4", "text": "Note:\u00a0Workbench does not need anything other than \"forward only\" cursors and the MySQL ODBC driver performs better using the \"forward only\" cursors option.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_5_faqs/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5 FAQs"}, {"objectID": "6d5418256c4f-5", "text": "How do I get access to network files to run a scheduled job?\nWhen running a job on a schedule, if the file is not located on the local machine\u00a0Workbench is running on, you must set up impersonation for access rights.\nTo set up impersonation,\nClick the\u00a0\u00a0icon in the left-hand icon bar.\u00a0Double-click the name of the job you want to set up impersonation for.Click the\u00a0Configure\u00a0subtab.Click\u00a0Impersonation\u00a0to expand that section.Check the\u00a0Requires Impersonation\u00a0box.Enter your domain, username, and password in the boxes.Click Validate.\nIf you are connecting to a file on a domain file share that the Workbench computer is not on, the domain impersonation will not work if you are not on the domain computer.

I want multiple users to be able to access and edit the jobs, but I can't figure out where jobs are saved on the drive.\nAll Workbench jobs are saved in the cloud and tied to a specific login, not saved locally. Therefore, the recommended solution to this problem is to install Workbench on a common server then create an admin user to be used by all users who need to modify jobs. Thus, all these users will be able to access the jobs, and you will not need to worry about saving copies of the job on a physical drive. Although multiple users can use Workbench simultaneously, only the first opened instance will get the live updates from the Workbench service. We generally do not recommend having multiple instances of Workbench open because of multiple people have the same job open and are making changes, the last person to save will overwrite all other changes.\u00a0\nCan I share Workbench jobs?\nJobs are tied to the Workbench installation in which they were created. If you wanted to share a job, you would need to export that job on the Workbench installation in which it was created then import it into the second installation of Workbench.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\u00a0It is not recommended to have the same job running on two different instances of Workbench at the same time.

To prevent the loss of data, you must first wait for the job to finish if it\u2019s running, then re-sync your local configuration with Domo. This can be done by either clicking Revert or pressing F5 on your keyboard to refresh your entire job list. Unfortunately you will lose any changes that you have made when you take either of these actions. If your job runs long enough or frequently enough that you constantly see this dialog when attempting to make changes, you likely need to temporarily turn off the Workbench service, make your changes, then re-enable the service to start running your newly modified job.\nMy IT department requires a whitelist for all outgoing internet traffic from our network. Does Domo have an IP whitelist for purposes of running Workbench?\nDomo Support can provide you with an IP to whitelist.

In this instance, jobs will wait in a queue until a slot is opened for them to run.\nUnder Settings, turn on\u00a0Limit Concurrent Jobs.Select the limit for Workbench jobs.\nRunning Workbench Jobs Below Normal Priority Execution\nIf you find that your Workbench Machine is using a lot of CPU, you can free up CPU for other applications by running the Workbench jobs at Below Normal Priority. This will limit the resources Workbench uses to execute your jobs and allow other applications to run normally. Typically, job execution will slow slightly.\nUnder Settings, turn on Run job process as\u00a0Below Normal priority.\nCanceling a Currently Running Job", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/workbench_5_training_topics/index.html", "title": "Workbench 5 Training Topics"}, {"objectID": "f78e73c49378-2", "text": "Canceling a Currently Running Job\nThere are a number of reasons you may want to stop a Workbench job.

When you turn on on impersonation, the Workbench job will run as the user specified, allowing access to the file.\nConnecting to an ODBC/OLAP connection that requires NT Authentication.\u00a0When you connect\u00a0to a database that uses NT Authentication, the database tables\u00a0are usually only accessible to a limited number of users. By turning on impersonation, the Workbench job will run as the specified user, allowing access to the database.\nQuickBooks jobs.\u00a0QuickBooks requires an interactive user session for Workbench to connect.

A World Map requires two data columns or rows from your DataSet: one containing country names or two-letter ISO codes (such as AU for Australia) and the other containing the values for each country. These values are represented in your map by varying colors, each corresponding to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your data and are represented by a legend, which automatically appears beside the map. For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nAll nations and most territories are represented. For a list of countries and their corresponding ISO codes, see Supported Country Codes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: When multiple instances of a single region occur in a DataSet, the values for that region are summed to show a single value for the region in the map. For example, if your DataSet contained three rows for \"Georgia,\" the values for the rows would be summed, and the Georgia region in the map would show the total value. You cannot turn off this automatic aggregation in maps.\n\n\n\nFor information about Continental or Regional maps, see U.S. County Map/U.S. State Map.\nFor troubleshooting information when an area in your map does not show data, but there is data, see Troubleshooting.\nVideo - Map Charts\n\n\u00a0\nPowering World Maps\nIn the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your map.
