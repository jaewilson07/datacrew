The Domo administrator for the publishing organization creates and maintains the connections to the subscribing organizations from the Domo Everywhere central hub. The admin also configures the authentication for each user within the subscribing organizations. This is called routing.\u00a0\nAfter routing is configured, the admin must create each subscribing organization within the publishing organization and provide the key attributes for the individual users that are authenticating so that they can be mapped to the appropriate subscribing organizations. After the key attributes are provided, Domo completes the mapping process automatically. The admin can then view the mapping details from within the publishing organization.\n\nThis article describes how to configure publishing organizations and subscriber organizations in the following topics:\nPrerequisitesRouting\u00a0 -\u00a0Grant embed access\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0Download/upload routing certificateSubscriber Organization Setup\u00a0 - Define the key attribute\u00a0 - Create a subscriber organization\u00a0 - Remove a subscriber organizationMappingTroubleshootingFAQ\nPrerequisites\nYou need to do the following before routing, creation, and mapping:\nPurchase the Domo Everywhere product.Configure the publishing organization in Domo.Identify your organization's authentication method in the following table and obtain any listed information.\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: If a third-party system hosts key attributes used to authenticate the identity of your users, choose OIDC or SAML.\n\n\n\nAuthentication MethodDescriptionJWT Secret\u00a0This method requires the simplest implementation.

If your application (the application using Domo ODBC Data Driver) is 32-bit, install a 32-bit driver. This document describes the steps involved in setting up Domo ODBC Data Driver on your machine.\nDomo ODBC Data Driver fetches data from Domo over HTTPS. The query execution time depends on the size of data and the data speed of your network.\nDomo ODBC Data Driver requires a Client ID and Client Secret for authentication, and it supports simple queries as described later in this document.\u00a0\nTo obtain Domo ODBC Data Driver, go to Admin >\u00a0Tool Downloads.\nTo purchase the ODBC Data Driver, reach out to your Account Executive (AE).\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The ODBC Driver fetches up to 1 million rows.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/domo_odbc_data_driver/index.html", "title": "Domo ODBC Data Driver"}, {"objectID": "d3b941a16832-1", "text": "Connection Strings\nODBC drivers follow this\u00a0format for the connection string:\nDriver={<Driver Name>};<additional parameters like username, password>\nThis is the format of additional parameters (key-value pairs separated by semicolon):\nparam1=value1;param2=value2;\nThe Domo ODBC Data Driver follows the same format.

The number of views in a drill path depends on the number of drill layers that have been incorporated into the Card; for example, if the Card designer added three drill layers into the Card, you would be able to see three unique filtered views for the Card.\nDrilldown\u00a0is available in both the Details view and in Pages with Domo Stories Dashboards enabled. For drilldown to be available in a Dashboard, you must first go into the\u00a0Interaction settings\u00a0for the Card and enable\u00a0Drill in place. For more information, see\u00a0Setting Card Interactions. Many drilldown options are available only when drilling from the Details view, such as the ability to remove filters in a drill view.\u00a0\nBy default, the final view in a drill path is a table showing the underlying data for all of the filtered elements. If no drill layers have been incorporated into the Card, this is the view you see when you click any element in the chart. This table view provides many options for changing how the data displays, including applying Filters and sorting, grouping and ungrouping like rows, changing the date grain and formatting, and so on. The table view is available only\u00a0when drilling down in the Details view for a Card; it is not\u00a0available when drilling from the Page view.\n\n\n \n\nNote: Drilldown is not available in Funnel graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTip:\u00a0You can filter to\u00a0show the underlying data for any item\u00a0in a Heat Map by clicking its scale label.

Only you see the data with the removed Filter, and when you exit the drill view the Filters reset.\nIf the content in a Card is filtered due to PDP policies, those Filters are retained when you drill down. For example, if you were a member of a PDP policy allowing you to see only the data in western states, you would still see only data relevant to you upon drilldown. For more information about PDP, see\u00a0Personalized Data Permissions (PDP).\nYou can also export data from a drill layer into Excel or CSV (Details view only).\u00a0\nThis topic discusses drilling down into a Card and the options available when drilling. It does not discuss adding drill layers to a KPI Card. For information about adding drill layers, see\u00a0Adding Drill Path to Your Chart.\nDomo also provides other means of performing in-depth data analysis, such as applying Filters. For more information, see Filtering Data in a Card Details View.\u00a0\nExample Scenario of Drilling Down\nThe following scenario shows how a user might navigate through a typical series of drill layers. Note that this scenario is specific to the Details view.\u00a0\nThe KPI Card, \"2010 Sales Chart,\" shows sales for a certain company throughout 2010. The top layer consists of a series of bars representing sales for each month of the year.\nThe user clicks the bar for July. A view appears, showing customers in a pie chart. In addition, a Filter is applied for the month of July. With the Filter, the chart shows only those customers who made purchases in July. If the user had clicked the bar for June, the view would be a pie chart of customers who made purchases in June. (The Card designer specifically designed the first drill layer to show sales by customer. The month is determined by the Filter.)", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/drilling_into_data/index.html", "title": "Drilling into Data"}, {"objectID": "026293ae3550-2", "text": "The user clicks the pie wedge for \"Risus, Inc.\" A third view appears, showing purchases by state. (Because the Card designer defined this view to show amounts by state, the view is always a map with both the month and customer determined by the Filters.) Due to the Filters, Maine is the only state that appears in the third view.\nThe user clicks the state of Maine in the map. The last view appears, showing a table with all the filtered data. (The last view is a default view that is not defined by the Card designer.)\nThe final table view is available only when drilling from the Details view; it is not available in the Page view.\u00a0\nRemoving Filters while Drilling\nWhen you navigate through drill layers within a Card, a new Filter is applied for every new level of drilldown. So, for example, the top level in a drill path might display a bar graph with sales for each month in the year. Clicking on the bar for a month might open a new view with a pie chart, with each slice in the pie showing amounts gained from different customers. In this case, a Filter for the month you clicked would be applied. As you drill deeper, new Filters would be applied in addition to those already added.\u00a0\nIn any view in a drill path, you can remove any Filters to show more information. (This option is available only in the Details view.) You do this by clicking the \"x\" on the right side of the Filter bar.

If you then clicked \"Texas\" and \"Oklahoma,\" all of the Cards in the Dashboard would be filtered to show only data for those states. Filter Cards only work when Interaction Filters are turned on. If Interaction Filters are not turned on, clicking a filter opens the Details view for the Card instead of applying the filter.

One option is\u00a0to use the Magic ETL\u00a0\"Uncollapse Columns\" transformation, which works pretty well; however, one disadvantage of this transform is that it's\u00a0not dynamic. The client does not want to manually edit the Magic DataFlow because he would have to\u00a0add a new \"Account\" metric every time a new metric was\u00a0added to the source data.\nLuckily there is at least one solution to accomplish this.

This is because it...\nworks better for mobile devices.is ideal for external users/non-employees.is based on OAuth 2, making it a better fit for developers.is simpler to configure and cheaper to acquire, making SSO accessible to small businesses and corporate companies.is an industry standard supported by identity systems such as Azure Active Directory, Auth0, Google G Suite, Okta, and OneLogin.\nOIDC is native to some IdPs, like Azure AD. Otherwise, an integrating system is required, such as Okta, Google, Ping, etc.\nYou can easily configure SSO with Azure Active Directory\u00a0or any other supported identity provider.\u00a0\u00a0\nBoth SAML and OIDC Connect can run at the same time. This makes it easy to segment internal and external users. This is also useful for separating the SSO solutions you use for Domo access and Domo\u00a0Embed.\u00a0\u00a0For example, you can use SAML\u00a0for controlling employee access in Domo\u00a0and OIDC for embedding cards into other websites and applications.\u00a0\nYou can still use Direct Sign-On (DSO) while both SSO methods are in use. Currently you must configure DSO in More > Admin > Authentication > OpenID Connect (SSO), even though it applies to both SAML and OIDC. For more information about DSO, see\u00a0Understanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On Using SAML.\nTo configure\u00a0OIDC, you must have an \"Admin\" security profile in Domo.

This makes configuration easier, since most\u00a0of your settings will be configured automatically. Otherwise you will need to enter the authentication request endpoint URL, client ID and client secret, and so on.\u00a0\nSupporting Internal and External Users\nEnterprise companies often have employees who are not in their corporate directory but still need access to Domo. It is possible for these users to allow sign-in using DSO, but this can become tedious with large numbers of users. A better solution is to use OIDC to introduce a second IdP specifically for external users. This allows you to share content with people not in your corporate directory. Users who come to Domo without authenticating are sent by default to the SAML\u00a0IdP.\nConfiguring OpenID Connect\nYou configure and enable OpenID Connect by navigating to More > Admin > Authentication > OpenID Connect (SSO) in the Admin Settings then filling in the required information and turning on advanced options if desired.\u00a0\nBy default, the interface assumes you want to use metadata-driven entry for your configuration. This means you only need to enter the client ID and client secret generated by your IdP, along with a well-known config\u00a0URL. The well-known config pulls in all metadata for the IdP, meaning you do not have to enter any other information for the IdP such as a token endpoint URL, public key, and so on. Nearly all IdPs\u00a0have well-known configs.

In addition, BYOK includes rolling generation of data encryption keys and a built-in kill switch. You can revoke the encryption key at any time, nullifying all of your data in Domo, and ensuring that no one will have access\u00a0to sensitive data.\u00a0\nHow Does it Work?\nDomo's BYOK is composed of the following three parts:\nEncryption Key Management\nBYOK supports the rotation of the encryption keys every hour. This equates to 8,760 rotating keys annually. Domo's access to the encrypted key can be revoked at any time so that the data can no longer be accessed.Kill Switch\nUtilizing the kill switch immediately caches and indexes data, rendering it unusable within seconds. This includes data accessed through laptops and mobile devices. To use this feature, you need to first revoke Domo's access to Amazon. Then, two different Domo Admins will need to activate the kill switch in their Domo Admin settings.\u00a0Activity Logs\nIf a user chooses to revoke their encryption keys and execute the kill switch, these events are logged in the Domo Activity Logs. This allows for immediate confirmation that data is no longer accessible.\n\u00a0\n\nHow Do I Get This?\nTo begin using Domo's BYOK, speak with your Domo Account Executive or Customer Success Manager.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\nNote: Be prepared to include your IT team in the process of setting up BYOK.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nMust have a Domo Enterprise accountAn Amazon Key Management System (KMS) accountSpeak with your Domo Account Executive to determine the type of KMS account neededCannot be on Microsoft AzureCannot be a federated data customer", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/encrypting_data_with_domos_bring_your_own_key_byok/index.html", "title": "Encrypting Data with Domo's Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)"}, {"objectID": "5e18f95e2658-0", "text": "Title\n\nEncrypting, Decrypting, and Hashing Workbench 5.1 Data\n\nArticle Body", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/encrypting_decrypting_and_hashing_workbench_51_data/index.html", "title": "Encrypting, Decrypting, and Hashing Workbench 5.1 Data"}, {"objectID": "5e18f95e2658-1", "text": "Intro\nYou can encrypt columns of data in your DataSet in Workbench 5.1.

The long run time occurs because Facebook is taking a long time to calculate the selected metrics. If the DataSet is taking too long or doesn't complete, the date range needs to be smaller.Metrics for ads placed through Instagram can be found by using the \"Custom Insights\" report and setting the Breakdown value to Placement.

However, figuring out how to map between the column names shown in the Facebook Ads UI and the list of available columns/categories can be tricky. The following steps can help:\nIn the Facebook Ads UI, open the report that you want to duplicate in Domo.Select Columns > Customize Columns.A dialog box opens that lets you choose and reorder columns in the report.Pick a column to add to the report and click Apply.If you look at the URL, you\u2019ll see a parameter called \"columns.\" This will look something like the following:columns=[\"name\"%2C\"date_start\"%2C\"date_stop\"%2C\"reach\"%2C\"frequency\"%2C\"impressions\"%2C\"cpm\"%2C\"cpp\"%2C\"spend\"%2C\"clicks\"%2C\"unique_clicks\"%2C\"ctr\"%2C\"unique_ctr\"%2C\"cpc\"%2C\"actions%3Aoffsite_conversion.lead\"%2C\"social_reach\"]Each of the items between quotes is a column, and this is the API name for it. The names that are shown in the Columns field are typically close (or identical) to these names.The tricky columns are ones that are actually part of a bigger category in the Domo UI. This includes columns like \"Actions,\" which expands into several smaller fields, including actions%3Aoffsite_conversion.lead shown above (which is \u201cLeads (Conversion)\u201d in the UI).\nInstagram Video Views\nTo show Instagram video views, do the following:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_advanced_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Advanced Connector"}, {"objectID": "8c719014243b-12", "text": "Instagram Video Views\nTo show Instagram video views, do the following:\nCreate a \"Custom Insights\" report.Select interesting metrics. \u201cActions\u201d should bring back a column about video views.Select Placement as the breakdown option.Choose the level to report (Account, Campaign, AdSet, Ad).Select the date range and time increment.\n\u00a0This will return information for many different placement options. The most interesting one is called \u201cinstagramstream.\u201d There should also be a column called \u201cActionsVideoView\u201d that lists the number of video views.\nAggregating Statistics\nIt is often tempting to use a Custom Insights report that is reporting at a very detailed level to calculate results for a higher level. For example, a DataSet may be reporting daily metrics for multiple campaigns. You could add up the daily data for all the campaigns in order to determine the total for the account that holds the campaigns. This works for some metrics like Clicks, Spend, or Impressions. However, for metrics that count individual people (such as \"Reach\"), this approach will fail and produce incorrect values. \"Reach,\" for example, fails because individuals are counted for each day they saw an ad. Then, if the Reach values for the month are added together, those people are counted multiple times. If the user compares this result to the result for the month in the Facebook Ads UI, they find that the aggregated value is far too high. The Facebook Ads UI removed the duplicated viewers, and only counted them once in the specified time period.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_advanced_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Advanced Connector"}, {"objectID": "8c719014243b-13", "text": "To avoid this problem, any time the user wants to get a value for a larger time period, the period needs to be defined in the DataSet itself, and not calculated afterward. If a user wants Reach for a particular month, the DataSet should be defined with the start and end dates for the month, and the Time Increment value should be set to all_days or left blank. The user can get monthly data, aggregated and deduplicated by Facebook, by setting a large date range (for example, Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2016) and entering monthly as the Time Increment value. Similarly, if a user wants Reach data at the Account level, the user needs to set the DataSet's Level value to Accounts (not Campaigns), followed by summing the values in Domo.\nIt is often useful to compare the results of the connector to the results available in the Facebook Ads UI. To perform the comparison correctly, however, the UI and the connector need to be configured identically. They need to be set to the same time period (start and end dates) as well as the same reporting level and time increment value.\nTroubleshooting\nThe most common problem occurs when the returned data and the Facebook Ads UI do not match. This happens when the DataSet and the report in the Facebook UI are not configured exactly the same way. Make sure the following parameters match:Start DateEnd DateBreakdownLevelTime Increment.Metrics related to individuals (such as Reach) should NOT be aggregated across time periods in Domo. These metrics have duplicates already removed by the Facebook Ads system.\nFAQ\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_advanced_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Advanced Connector"}, {"objectID": "8c719014243b-14", "text": "FAQ\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\nYou will need the email address that is associated with your Facebook account, and your Facebook password. The login process uses the OAuth process, so your password is never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\nDo I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?\nYou will need a Facebook account that has access to the Facebook Ads account(s) that you are interested in. There are three levels of access available: Analyst, Advertiser and Administrator. Analyst-level access is enough for the reports available in the connector.\nHow do I choose the columns I need in a Custom Insights report?\nThe Custom Insights report is very flexible and will allow you to create nearly any report that can be created in the Facebook Ads UI. However, figuring out how to map between the column names shown in the Facebook Ads UI and the list of available columns/categories can be tricky. The following steps can help:\nIn the Facebook Ads UI, open the report that you want to duplicate in Domo.On the right-hand side of the screen click the button labeled Columns and select Customize Columns. You should now see a dialog box that lets you choose and reorder columns that will be in the report.Pick a column to add to the report and click Apply.If you look at the URL, you'll see a URL parameter called 'columns'. This will look something like this:columns=[\"name\",\"date_start\",\"date_stop\",\"reach\",\"cpm\",\"cpp\",\"spend\",\"clicks\",\"unique_clicks\",\"ctr\",\"unique_ctr\",\"cpc\",\"actions:offsite_conversion.lead\",\"social_reach\"]", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_advanced_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Advanced Connector"}, {"objectID": "8c719014243b-15", "text": "Each of the items between quotes is a column.

In the Domo interface, this column is called \"Leads (Conversion)\".\nHow do I get statistics about Instagram Views?\nInstagram ads are included as a special placement option for ads. The following steps will get statistics about them:\nCreate a Custom Insights report.Select interesting metrics.

The biggest difference is that the Custom Insights report is only available in the Advanced connector. Also, this connector supports the Ads Advanced report that provides information about one or more Ads defined in the selected\u00a0Ad Set(s)\u00a0with separate column for Ad link URLs.\nThe Facebook Ads connector is a predefined set of easy-to-use reports. For more options and flexibility with report configuration, we recommend to use the Advanced connector.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nThe data in this connector is roughly real-time. However, many statistics are subject to change for up to 3 days as Facebook determines the exact number of views, etc.\nAre there any API limits I should be aware of?\nFacebook may enforce rate limits on calls to its API, but you should not have to worry about this.\nMy Facebook Ads DataSets take a long time to run.

For example, a DataSet may be reporting daily metrics for multiple campaigns. You could add up the daily data for all the campaigns in order to determine the total for the account that holds the campaigns. This works for some metrics like Clicks, Spend, or Impressions. However, for metrics that count individual people (such as \"Reach\"), this approach will fail and produce incorrect values. \"Reach,\" for example, fails because individuals are counted for each day they saw an ad. Then, if the Reach values for the month are added together, those people are counted multiple times. If the user compares this result to the result for the month in the Facebook Ads UI, they find that the aggregated value is far too high. The Facebook Ads UI removed the duplicated viewers, and only counted them once in the specified time period.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Connector"}, {"objectID": "654978f0fd3a-7", "text": "To avoid this problem, any time the user wants to get a value for a larger time period, the period needs to be defined in the DataSet itself, and not calculated afterward. If a user wants Reach for a particular month, the DataSet should be defined with the start and end dates for the month, and the Time Increment value should be set to all_days or left blank. The user can get monthly data, aggregated and deduplicated by Facebook, by setting a large date range (for example, Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2016) and entering monthly as the Time Increment value. Similarly, if a user wants Reach data at the Account level, the user needs to set the DataSet's Level value to Accounts (not Campaigns), followed by summing the values in Domo.\nIt is often useful to compare the results of the connector to the results available in the Facebook Ads UI. To perform the comparison correctly, however, the UI and the connector need to be configured identically. They need to be set to the same time period (start and end dates) as well as the same reporting level and time increment value.\nTroubleshooting\nDoes the user have access to the company's Facebook Ads account?Is the time range valid for the account/campaigns/ad sets/ads selected?\nFAQ\nWhat version of the Facebook API does this connector use?\nThis connector uses version 14 of the Facebook Marketing API (https://graph.facebook.com/v14).\nDo I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?\nYou will need a Facebook account that has access to the Facebook Ads account(s) that you are interested in. There are three levels of access available: Analyst, Advertiser and Administrator. Analyst-level access is enough for the reports available in the connector.\nWhat is the difference between the Facebook Ads and Facebook Ads Advanced connectors?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Connector"}, {"objectID": "654978f0fd3a-8", "text": "What is the difference between the Facebook Ads and Facebook Ads Advanced connectors?\nThe Facebook Ads Advanced connector provides far more reports and options than the Facebook Ads connector. The biggest difference is that the Custom Insights report is only available in the Advanced connector.\nThe Facebook Ads connector is a predefined set of easy-to-use reports. For more options and flexibility with report configuration, you should use the Advanced connector.\nHow often can the data be updated?\nThe data in this connector is roughly real-time. However, many statistics are subject to change for up to 3 days as Facebook determines the exact number of views, etc.\nAre there any API limits I should be aware of?\nFacebook may enforce rate limits on calls to its API, but you should not have to worry about this.\nMy Facebook Ads DataSets take a long time to run. What can I do to make them run faster?\nFacebook Ads is known to take a long time because Facebook has to calculate the results of a query before we can start pulling the data. Depending on the load on their servers, this can take a LONG time. It seems that scheduling queries for off-peak times helps DataSets run faster. For example, one team in India was able to run a Facebook Ads DataSet in 15 minutes, but when another user tried the same DataSet 6-8 hours later, it took about 2 hours.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_ads_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Ads Connector"}, {"objectID": "653b882bd8a6-0", "text": "Title\n\nFacebook Advanced Connector\n\nArticle Body", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/facebook_advanced_connector/index.html", "title": "Facebook Advanced Connector"}, {"objectID": "653b882bd8a6-1", "text": "Intro\nDomo's Facebook Advanced connector can combine Facebook insights with data from any other source\u2014finance analytics, CRM software, etc.\u2014to target campaigns with unparalleled precision.
