For information about creating a request template, see\u00a0Approvals\u00a0Layout.\nExample\nLet's say that the chief inspections engineer for filtration company \"Wetter Water\" creates a template to be used by members of his\u00a0quality control staff whenever they need to do an inspection at a customer company. The template includes required fields such as the customer name, the physical address, the expected amount of time to be spent offsite, the priority level, and so on. Two approvers are specified in the approval chain\u2014Marlo, the chief inspections engineer himself, and Marlo's supervisor, company COO Janice.

With\u00a0Subset Processing, you can choose to load only the batches updated since the last successful execution or you can specify the batches to be loaded based on their creation date or partition name.\u00a0You can customize your approach to your organization's specific needs. To learn more about partitions, data architecture, and how to optimize your data pipeline, visit our Data Center Overview topic in the knowledge base.\nThis article provides information\u00a0about using Subset Processing in the following topics:\nPartition\u00a0basicsPartition best practicesConfigure initial data processingUse caseConfigure update method\nPartition Basics\nPartitions are a way of organizing your data into groups to make data updates faster and more efficient. The graphic below illustrates replacing and appending data with partitions.\nA common way to understand partitions is to think of\u00a0an encyclopedia\u2014a collection of books that are part of the same set, but individually different. If an update is made to one book and it is republished, you can buy a new copy of that book without replacing the entire set of books. Partitions divide your data into separate collections, or subsets, so that when you replace some data, you do not need to replace all of it. Appending data when using partitions is like buying a new volume of the encyclopedia and adding it to the end of your collection on the shelf.The following notes further define using the partitions:\nPartition key tags divide data into subsets.Ingestion of new data only affects the specified partitions.Accessing and updating only the necessary data partitions makes the process faster and more efficient.\nPartition Best Practices", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/subset_processing_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Subset Processing in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "a59cb6b95c77-2", "text": "Partition Best Practices\nA good partition needs to be large enough to take advantage of the enhanced processing speed that partitioning offers, but also\u00a0granular enough to meet your specific needs.\u00a0For most situations, a date-based, day-level partition strikes a good balance between these alternatives. However, if you need to keep more than five year's worth\u00a0of\u00a0day-based partitions in a single DataSet, you may want to consider using a week-level or month-level partition instead.Some organizations need partitions that are more granular than day level. If that is the case for your organization, you can create a custom partition by combining two or more columns in your DataFlow. For example, if you have eight store locations, you might want to create a partition that combines the store ID and the date.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/subset_processing_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Subset Processing in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "a59cb6b95c77-3", "text": "Important: There is a 1500-partition limit for each DataSet. If you create too many partitions, you may reach this limit and experience problems. In the example from the previous paragraph, if you create a partition key using store ID + date, you can only store 187 day's worth\u00a0of data. (1500 partitions divided by 8 stores.)\n\n\n\nConfigure Initial Data Processing\nMagic ETL provides three data selection methods when configuring your input DataSet for a DataFlow: All, New, and Filter by batch. These methods are described in the process below.\u00a0\nFollow the steps below to set up initial data processing in Magic ETL.\nAccess Magic ETL by locating your DataSet in Domo and going to the\u00a0Data\u00a0tab for the DataSet.In the Data\u00a0tab, select\u00a0Open With\u00a0> Magic ETL.\u00a0\tThe Magic ETL interface opens with your DataSet on the canvas as the input DataSet.\n\tSelect the DataSet on the canvas to expand the editor\u00a0at the bottom of the screen and display four tabs:\u00a0Configuration, Details, Data, and\u00a0Notes.In the\u00a0Configuration\u00a0tab, expand the\u00a0Data Selection menu and choose the data selection method that meets your needs. These methods are described below:\n\tAll \u2014\u00a0This is the default option.\u00a0Selecting this option loads all rows from the selected input DataSet. Some DataFlow options may be automatically optimized.\n\t\tTo learn more about automatic optimization, see our Magic ETL DataFlow Auto Append Processing article.New\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Select this option if you want to load to the DataSet batches\u00a0updated since the last successful execution, including restated partitions.\n\t\tIf you select this option and your DataSet has a replace operation, the next DataFlow execution loads all batches from the replace and any batches appended since the replace. Your outputs continue to perform the action that you have saved for the DataFlow (such as append or replace).", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/subset_processing_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Subset Processing in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "a59cb6b95c77-4", "text": "Note: If you occasionally replace all batches in your input DataSet and always append to your output DataSet within the DataFlow, there may be duplicate data in your output DataSet.\n\n\nFilter by batch \u2014 Select this option if you want to specify which batches\u00a0to load based on their creation date or, in the case of partitions, their name.\u00a0If you choose this option, you must also complete the section of the editor labeled\u00a0Filter by Batch.\u00a0 \nIn the Import data when field, there are two options:\n If you want to load data using a specific processing date, select\u00a0Data processed. Then select the logic you want from the list options in the\u00a0Date is in\u00a0fields. \n\n If you want to load data using a custom expression, select\u00a0Custom expression. Use the formula field to create a custom expression. The table below contains information about what values you can use to write a custom expression.\u00a0 \nWhen it comes to partitioning a DataSet, the process is based on the metadata about the DataSet rather than the values within the data itself. This means that when you define a subset of the DataSet, you are not selecting specific values within the data, but rather are selecting a subset of the metadata that defines the data.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/subset_processing_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Subset Processing in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "a59cb6b95c77-5", "text": "batch.idThe numerical identifier for a data part.

Compare with batch.id.partition.nameThe name of the partition with which the batch is associated. Identical to batch.name in this context. The value is null if the batch is not associated with a partition.  \nUse Case\nThe formula displayed in this image (there is a code sample below)\u00a0takes advantage\u00a0of the fact that the input DataSet is partitioned by date. This means that the data is split into different partitions based on the date, which allows the formula to use date-related functions to filter the data.\n\nThe formula creates a filter that compares the partition name (which is a date) to the current date. If the current date is the first day of the month, the filter allows all partitions from the past year to pass through. If the current date is any other day of the month, the filter only allows the last 30 day's worth of partitions to pass through.\nThis filtering strategy enables you to process less data every day while still maintaining a full year's worth of data one time per month. You can use this approach in various scenarios, and we recommend that you experiment\u00a0with it.\nDATE(batch.name) >= CURRENT_DATE() \u2013 (CASE WHEN DAYOFMONTH(CURRENT_DATE()) = 1 THEN 365 ELSE 30 END)", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/subset_processing_in_magic_etl/index.html", "title": "Subset Processing in Magic ETL"}, {"objectID": "a59cb6b95c77-6", "text": "Configure Update Method\nThe following data update methods are available in Magic ETL:\nUpdate MethodDescriptionReplaceEach execution replaces the output DataSet's contents with its latest results.AppendEach execution appends its results to the output DataSet as a new batch.Partition\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each execution groups rows into batches according to a name, which is the value of a specific column.

Imperial units of length, area, and mass/weight are mostly agreed upon internationally; the ton is an exception. Units of volume, like the gallon, also differ between the UK and the USA. When such differences arise, USA customary values (e.g. the short ton; 2000 avoirdupois pounds) are used.\n2. Units may be written out in full, and optionally pluralized. Metric units may have metric prefixes, and computing units may have metric or binary prefixes.

Units may be abbreviated. Metric and binary prefixes on abbreviated units must also be abbreviated. Abbreviated units are case-sensitive. Examples: ''mi'' (miles), ''KiBps'' (kibibytes per second), ''uPa'' (micropascals)\n4. Units may be exponentiated using the caret ''^'' or by ending a unit's name with a number. Exponents may be negative to indicate inversion of the unit. Units may also be prefixed with ''cu''/''cubic'' or ''sq''/''square'', followed by a space '' '' or hyphen ''-'', which are equivalent to the exponents ''3'' and ''2'', respectively. Examples: ''sq ft'' (square feet), ''m3'' (cubic meters), ''s^-1'' (inverse seconds; hertz)\n5. Units may be divided using the forward slash ''/'' character or the word '' per ''. Examples: ''miles per hour'', ''metres/second/second'' (meters per second squared; acceleration)\n6. Units may be multiplied using the asterisk ''*'' or by being combined with a hyphen ''-'' or space. The asterisk follows normal multiplication order of operations, while the hyphen or space form have the highest precedence, as though the combined units were a single unit name. Examples: ''N*m'' (newton meters; joules), ''half-gal'' (half gallons), ''kilogram-meters/second2'' (kilogram meters per second squared; newtons)\n7.

There are five supported dimensional values: Time, length, mass, electric current, and information. Units may have a positive, negative, or zero number of dimensions in any of these values. Some units have zero dimensions in all categories; these units are raw quantities like ''dozen'' or ''half''. ''meters / second'' has one positive length dimension, and one negative time dimension; it is a unit of velocity. The ''gallon'' has three positive length dimensions; it is a unit of volume.

This behavior is represented in the following example chart, which is used to show the correlation between the amount of snowfall and the number of traffic accidents in a certain city over a period of five months. The value scale on the left corresponds to the line, which represents the snowfall, and ranges from 0 to 25 in increments of 5. The value scale on the right corresponds to the bars, representing the number of accidents, and ranges from 0 to 100 in increments of 20.\n\nBecause the scales are not synced in this example, it is time-consuming to match up the line and bars with their respective scales. You can make dual-scale charts easier to read and comprehend by syncing the scales so that the same set of numbers is used for both the lines and bars.\nThe following example shows how the chart in the preceding example would look if the scales were synced:\n\nWhen the scales in the chart are synced, the data is easier to read since you don't need to spend time trying to figure out which scales correspond to the line and bars.\nTo sync value scales in a dual-scale chart,\nOpen the Analyzer\u00a0for the chart you want to edit.In Chart Properties, click General.Check\u00a0Sync Value Scales.\nAfter value scales in a chart have been synced, you can hide the second scale so only one scale appears for the chart.

The main use of tableau software is to help people see and understand their data.\u00a0\nCombine your Tableau data with Domo and plan for future business demands. With the Domo Tableau Connector, you can get constant access to your data, and gain views and insights on your data. To learn more about the Tableau API, visit their page (https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api.htm).\nThe Tableau Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud.

The image below shows an example of a Heat Map Table.  Mega Tables provide the same functionality as HTML Tables and Heat Map Tables but include much more. They can have up to 25,000 rows and contain HTML links and images. You can also collapse and expand, sort, and scroll through Mega Tables on a Dashboard.\nAll of the above tables are built in the same way and are discussed in this article. Domo also includes two other types of tables, which are discussed in their own articles:\nFlex Tables display different rows\u00a0for each series of a chart, with all series shown as individual Spark Line or Spark Bar charts.\u00a0For more\u00a0information, see our Flex Table\u00a0article.Pivot Tables allow you to efficiently summarize large quantities of data from a DataSet and explore data by different dimensions and measures.

The order in which you arrange the columns is the order in which they display in the table.\nFor example, if you drag the `Order Date` column into the first field, the `Customer Name`\u00a0column into the second field, and the `Amount` column into the third field, the columns display in the table in that order. You can drag and drop column fields to rearrange them as needed.\nThe following table shows the relationship between field order and table column order:Columns retain their unique data types even after\u00a0you drop them into a field.\u00a0As with other chart types, you can select a column in the\u00a0Columns region to access additional options, such as aggregation, formatting, and so on.

A Snapshot is essentially a static picture of the card, providing an unchanging view of how it appeared within that moment, just like a picture taken with a camera. This capability is available for all card types (KPI, notebook, document, etc.).\nOne of the most useful features of the Snapshot tool is the ability to add annotations such as text, arrows, and simple\u00a0shapes. This allows you to call out aspects of the card you want to draw attention to. In the following example, the user noticed that customer satisfaction was down in the APAC region. After taking a snapshot of the card, he used annotation tools to call out the problem area and ask why such a problem was occurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe user can then share the annotated version of the card with other users who should be aware of the problem.\nBe aware that when you take Snapshots and add annotations, the annotations are\u00a0not\u00a0added to the card. You are essentially creating a shareable\u00a0image\u00a0of the card with annotations applied.

The last dot\u00a0is connected to the box by a line, as shown in the following example:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/taking_snapshots_of_cards/index.html", "title": "Taking Snapshots of Cards"}, {"objectID": "30f03c6671a3-2", "text": "You can manipulate annotation objects by clicking and dragging on these dots, as explained in the following sections.\nChanging the size and shape of an object\nWith a non-text object, clicking and dragging on the perimeter dots changes the size and shape of the object. Clicking and dragging on edge dots changes the shape; for example, if you had a square object and you dragged upward on the bottom edge dot, the square would be flattened into a rectangle. Clicking and dragging on corner dots changes the size of the object. Note that arrows do not have edge dots, only corner dots, so you cannot change their shape.\u00a0\nWith a textbox, clicking and dragging on the edge dots does not change the shape; it expands or contracts the space available for text, pushing it to the next line if need be. For example, if you took the text in the previous screenshot and clicked and dragged far enough on the right-side dot, the name \"Bunderson\" would drop to the next line.\n\nRotating an object\nFor any kind of object, clicking and dragging on the \"other\" dot (the one connected to the object by a line) allows you to rotate the object. You can even do this with text. In the following example, the user rotated both the arrow and the accompanying text:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/taking_snapshots_of_cards/index.html", "title": "Taking Snapshots of Cards"}, {"objectID": "30f03c6671a3-3", "text": "Moving Objects\nYou can move any object by clicking it to select it (the bounding box will appear) and then moving it wherever you want it.\nSelecting Multiple Objects\nYou can select multiple annotation objects by selecting the first object, holding down the Shift key, then clicking to select all remaining objects. When you select multiple objects, you can apply various actions to them at once, including the following:\nMoving them on the cardChanging the colorResizing themChanging the shape (note that if any textboxes are included, you cannot click and drag to change the shape)Rotating them\nYou cannot currently delete multiple objects at once.\nClearing All Annotations\nYou can clear all annotations from the card by clicking the Clear\u00a0button at the bottom of the dialog.\u00a0\nSharing a Snapshot\nYou can share a snapshot with others in your company via Buzz. When you click the\u00a0Share\u00a0button at the bottom of the dialog, a single option appears\u2014Share to Buzz.

In this case, the output fields will be available for use as the Date Range Field on the card and can also be used in Beast Mode calculations.\nAlso, note that the code used to adjust time zones will differ between a Beast Mode and MySQL DataFlows. In MySQL, the CONVERT_TZ() function can be used to adjust a date from one time zone to another, automatically handling Daylight Saving Time concerns in the process. When using Beast Mode calculations, Daylight Saving Time needs to be considered in the code.\nHow can I adjust Beast Mode functions to account for Daylight Saving Time?\nProblem:\nTimestamp outputs for DataFlows will timestamp according the local time zone settings of your instance.

For an overview, see Magic ETL Tiles: Scripting.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll provide an overview of troubleshooting tips for optimizing memory use in your container. In some cases, you may still need to upgrade your container. For guidance on requesting a container upgrade, see Requesting Memory Upgrades.\nTroubleshooting tips\nTip 1\nYou can use Magic ETL tiles to reduce the memory footprint in your script. Magic ETL tiles have been optimized for memory-intensive operations. We recommend excluding intensive operations in your script that can be handled through Magic ETL tiles instead.\nExamples\nYou can use the Performance tiles in Magic ETL to exclude columns in your DataSet that are not needed in your script. For information on using Performance tiles, see Magic ETL Tiles: Performance. This will reduce the DataSet that will be processed in your script.\nYou can also use the Filter Rows tile and the Remove Duplicates tile to exclude rows that are not needed for the DataSet used in your script. For information on using the Filter tile, see Magic ETL Tiles: Filter.\nTip 2\nVerify that you are using the latest versions of the packages needed in your script. Newer versions of the package are often optimized for performance and memory. If you need to request a package upgrade, see Requesting Custom Environments for details.\nTip 3\nBreaking up an operation into segments can help reduce memory footprint, especially for intensive operations like looping. You could also consider breaking up the DataFlow into separate DataFlows.\nTip 4\nTest memory for data size only. You can set up a DataFlow that simply writes the input (no operations in the script.) If the DataFlow, errors out then you need to reduce the DataSet size (Tip 1) or evaluate a memory upgrade.\nRequesting Memory Upgrades", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/troubleshooting_scripting_tiles_memory_errors/index.html", "title": "Troubleshooting Scripting Tiles Memory Errors"}, {"objectID": "c0faf78ac8d3-2", "text": "Requesting Memory Upgrades\nWhile the tips above may help lower your memory footprint, in some cases your workflow will simply require more memory.

If they have not entered mobile numbers into Domo, they will receive an email instead. They will not receive a separate prompt.\nThe mobile app does not currently act as the second factor for authentication. Users on mobile will need to receive the SMS message the first time they log in.\nIf enabling multi-factor authentication outside the US, please note that your valid mobile phone number MUST start with a country code.

This means that your business will need to sign a contract with Twitter to use this API.

It is recommended to configure the datasets to run every 24 hours.\nCan I use the same Twitter account for multiple datasets?\nYes\nWhy didn't my dataset return any new rows when it ran?\nThis generally happens if there is no data for the connector to return. Most frequently this happens if there is no activity (new tweets, retweets, etc.) on the account after the Start Date.\nWhy is the report taking so long to run? Is this normal?\nSome of the reports can take a very long time to run. They have to read through several levels of data, making multiple calls to Twitter at each step. The time increases even more if you select all Tweets and run for all time.\nTroubleshooting\nTroubleshooting usually starts with making sure you don't have an issue with the credentials.

This can also happen if the \"Retrieve All Available Data\" is set to \"No\" and you run the dataset too frequently.

For example, you might have a simple two-column Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with one column for salespeople and another column for sales in the month of January; you could upload this spreadsheet to Domo and create a vertical bar chart that showed the values for each salesperson. Or, you might connect to a database with hundreds of columns and rows; you could then build dozens of charts, with each chart powered by only a few different columns from your database.\nRefer to the following sections in this topic for information about column- and row-based DataSet layouts and the different types of data and how these are interpreted by charts. (what does this mean?) This information is important because each chart type requires columns containing specific types of data to be powered up. For example, a simple bar chart requires only a value column and category column, whereas a scatter plot chart requires three value columns and a series column.\nFor information about adding DataSets to Domo using data connectors, see Connecting to Data with Connectors.\u00a0fix this link to have the right name of the target article\nVideo - How Data Becomes a Card", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/understanding_chart_data/index.html", "title": "Understanding Chart Data"}, {"objectID": "3c787af703e1-1", "text": "Types of data in a DataSet\nWhen we talk about the types of data in a DataSet, we may be referring to one of two different things: the data type, an automatic interpretation of how the data in a DataSet should be used, or the column or row type, which you use to tell Domo which data should be applied on which axis in your chart. It is important to understand the distinctions between these types of data because you need to be able to apply them correctly to power a chart.\nFor more information about applying columns to a chart, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nData type\nWhen you add a DataSet into Domo,(let's change the verb here) the data in each column is categorized by its data type. The data type of a column determines how it can be used in a chart. For example, if your DataSet contains a column with text values, such as employee names, Domo assigns a data type of string to the column. It then assumes that you are going to apply that column to a category or series axis on your chart. Similarly, if a column contains numeric values, Domo assigns a data type of numeric to the column and assumes you are going to apply the column to a value axis.\nAlthough you can apply any column to any axis on your chart, each axis in a given chart is designed for specific data types; consequently, if you apply the wrong data type to an axis, the chart does not appear correctly. For example, in most chart types, applying a column with a \"date\" data type to your \"series\" axis causes the date data to be represented incorrectly.\nThe following table lists the data types in Domo:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/understanding_chart_data/index.html", "title": "Understanding Chart Data"}, {"objectID": "3c787af703e1-2", "text": "The following table lists the data types in Domo:\nData TypeDescriptionDateContains date values in any of a variety of different formats. Date columns are usually applied to your category axis when creating a chart.\u00a0let's give examples of each type of data mentioned in this chart.DatetimeContains time or date-time values in any of a variety of different formats. Date-time columns are usually applied to your category axis when creating a chart.NumericContains straight numbers, though a few special characters (such as commas) are permitted. Adding letters or other characters changes the data type to \"date\" or \"string.\" You usually apply numeric columns to value axes (and sometimes series axes) when creating a chart.StringGenerally contains non-numeric characters, though in some scenarios you may be able to pass off numeric columns as string columns (for example, by changing the cell format in Microsoft Excel to \"Text\"). You usually apply string columns to category and series axes in a chart.\nIn\u00a0Analyzer, each column selection menu lists the columns in your DataSet by data type. This makes it easier to apply columns to the appropriate axes in your chart. The screenshot in Column or row headers shows an example of this. For more information about applying columns to a chart, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nColumn or row type\nData in a DataSet you upload or connect to can generally\u2014but not always\u2014be categorized as belonging to any of these column or row types: header data, category data, series data, and value data.\nThe following screenshot shows the column or row types in a typical column-based DataSet, and these are described in greater detail in continuation.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/understanding_chart_data/index.html", "title": "Understanding Chart Data"}, {"objectID": "3c787af703e1-3", "text": "A row-based DataSet contains the same types of data.

The labels in the header row or column do not appear in the charts powered by this DataSet. However, Domo often uses these names in the product when referring to the columns or rows. For example, in the Analyzer, you apply\u00a0columns or rows\u00a0to power the chart by dragging their header labels\u00a0into fields corresponding to the chart axes. For more information, see\u00a0Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nCategory and series columns and rows\nA category column or row contains items being measured, either as the names of those items or as a series of dates on which measurements were taken. Typically, categories are represented on the horizontal axis or x-axis. Most charts require a category column or row to be powered up. (Exceptions include X-Y coordinate charts, such as scatter plot and bubble charts, in which there are two value columns or rows.) In more complex chart types, categories are broken down into series items. For instance, in the DataSet previously shown, the \"Charles\" category can be broken down by team\u2014either Team A, Team B, or Team C, as reflected in the following chart in which each category is a group of three series or bars:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/understanding_chart_data/index.html", "title": "Understanding Chart Data"}, {"objectID": "3c787af703e1-4", "text": "In chart types that include legends, the legend items are generally used to denote the series data. One exception to this is in maps, which lack series columns but use legends to denote ranges in the map.\nValue columns and rows\nA value column or row contains the measurements for the categories and/or series columns/rows in the chart. In the preceding screenshot, the heights of each bar are determined by the values for each category-series pair and are measured by the vertical scale on the left side of the chart (or the y-axis). In many chart types, values are measured on the vertical axis, or y-axis.\nMost chart types require a value column or row; some types, like bubble charts, require more than one.\nFor information about applying data columns to chart axes in the Analyzer,\u00a0see Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nDataSet\u00a0layouts\nDataSets used to power charts can have a column-based layout or a row-based layout.\nYou specify the layout type of your data when adding the DataSet.

You can also add multiple drill path levels to a chart by filtering off of different columns or rows. For more information about adding drill paths, see\u00a0Adding Drill Path to Your Chart.\nColumn-based layouts\nIn DataSets with a column-based layout, data items are arranged in columns and the first row contains the labels for each column.

This type of layout may be used in applications in which you enter data manually, such as Microsoft Excel. Cross-tab layouts are converted to standard columnar layouts when pulled into Domo. For each column in a converted cross-tab layout, Domo affixes a default name in the format \"Column1,\" \"Column2,\" etc. You can change these default names if you want.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote:\u00a0You can only pull cross-tab data into Domo from a Microsoft Excel DataSet.

Joins work by combining two tables together on a unique column. The type of join you\u2019re using will determine the way the two tables will join together. \nFor example, say you have a table (see Table 1) that gives you daily sales numbers and a second table (see Table 2) that gives you daily number of employees worked, and you would really like to see how many employees worked on any given day and compare that to your sales numbers for each day. Using a full outer left join, we would join the two tables together, so that date = date. Any row on table two that has a date that matches table one will be joined onto table one on the same row. So, for Table 3, we now have date, the daily sales, and the number of employees worked all in the same table.\nWhen you pull this DataSet into Domo, no error will result.\nTable 1.
