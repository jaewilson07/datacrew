In addition to the flow of an item, the Sankey chart captures the relative size of the flow itself by changing the line width from node to node.\u00a0For more information, see our Sankey Chart\u00a0article.\nSankey charts consist of nodes, or end points, and colored arrows or lines. See below for a simple Sankey chart.\n\nThe original Sankey chart is ideal for physical flows that go to a destination once per flow,\u00a0like energy and materials. However, it's not ideal for recursive concepts like web traffic, where flows need to circle back to previous nodes and require special treatment to display properly. To meet these needs, Domo has created the circular Sankey chart.\nThe following image emphasizes the chart's circular reference:\n\nPowering Circular Sankey Charts\nA circular Sankey chart requires each of the following:\nA `From` dimension \u2014 The source of the flow.A `To` dimension \u2014 The destination of the flow.A value \u2014 The size of the flow.\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see our\u00a0Understanding Chart Data\u00a0article.\n\nIn Analyzer, you can choose the columns containing the data for your circular Sankey chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see our article about Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart.\nThe following image shows how data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a circular Sankey chart:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/circular_sankey_chart/index.html", "title": "Circular Sankey Chart"}, {"objectID": "696932cfbc21-1", "text": "Customizing Circular Sankey Charts\nYou can customize the appearance of a circular Sankey chart in several ways, many of which are possible with the\u00a0Chart Properties\u00a0tool. For more information, see our Chart Properties\u00a0article.\nSome unique properties of circular Sankey charts are shown in the following table:\nPropertyDescriptionExampleGeneral > Value FormatDetermines whether currency symbols are appended to values.\u2014General > Value Decimal PlacesDetermines the number of decimal places in values.\u2014General > Percent Value Decimal PlacesDetermines the number of decimal places in percent values.\u2014General > Layout methodAllows you to select different layouts for your Sankey data. You can see which one works best for your data.General > Hide CircularAllows you to hide circular references in the chart.\nWhen you select this checkbox, the chart handles recursion but doesn't display the loops back.Node OptionsAllows you to set the fill and border colors for nodes.Flow OptionsAllows you to set the fill and border colors for flows.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/circular_sankey_chart/index.html", "title": "Circular Sankey Chart"}, {"objectID": "a5f1163f6701-0", "text": "TitleCisco Prime ConnectorArticle BodyIntro\nCisco Prime is a network management software suite that simplifies the management of wireless and wired networks. \u00a0 To learn more about the Cisco Prime API, visit their page (https://developer.cisco.com/site/prime-infrastructure/documents/api-reference/rest-api-v3-0/).\nYou connect to your Cisco Prime account in the Data Center.

Jobs will also fail when the data type of a column is changed (e.g. from \"Date\" to \"Text\").There is a setting called Allow schema changes in the DataSet Jobs > Settings in Workbench.

If possible, revert any changes that were made to the original data source that caused the schema to change.Manually running the job once via the Workbench UI updates the schema, regardless of the setting for Allow schema changes in the DataSet Jobs > Settings in Workbench.If you change the setting, Workbench updates the schema automatically.

Like a comparative fill gauge, a comparative gauge shows the degree of change between a previous value and a current value. It is different in that it lacks graphical elements, consisting solely of a percentage value, and does not require a minimum, maximum, or target value.\nThe degree of change may be shown as a percentage or as a straight value. Alternatively, you may choose to show only the current value. You can change this setting in Chart Properties. \u00a0\nOther gauge types in Domo include single value gauges,\u00a0radial gauges,\u00a0face gauges, progress bar gauges, and\u00a0filled gauges.\u00a0\nPowering comparative gauges\nA comparative gauge requires only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet. One of these contains the current value for the gauge, and the other\u00a0contains the previous value.\nIf multiple rows are present in your DataSet, only the\u00a0first\u00a0row is used.

You can choose to have\u00a0thousands separators, decimals, dollar signs, percents, various combinations of the above, or no formatting at all.\nSummary Number best practices\nWhen setting Summary Numbers, the most important guideline is making sure your labels are clear and specific. If a label is vague, the chart will be harder for viewers to interpret. For example, if you had a Scatter Plot graph and you simply set the Summary Number label to \"Average,\" viewers would not know which of the two value columns in the graph you were referring to. A better label would be something like \"Average # of Employees,\" \"Average Salary,\" etc. The use of clear, specific labels is especially important when you set the size of your KPI Cards to small. In small Cards, the Summary Number is the only chart element that displays\u2014users cannot see the actual charts. If users cannot grasp the meaning of the chart from the Summary Number in this case, then the KPI Card has failed. For more information about sizing Cards, see Changing the Size of Cards in a Page.\nAlso, remember that certain aggregations are more appropriate for some chart types than others. If you use the wrong type of aggregation with a particular chart type, it could be detrimental to a user's comprehension of the chart. For example, the \"Current\" aggregation is most appropriate for chart types with a trendline. Using this aggregation with other chart types may not make much sense.\nAlso, there are a number of chart types in which Summary Numbers actually detract from the effectiveness of the chart\u2014in these, it is recommended that Summary Numbers be turned off.\nFor more information on creating effective Summary Numbers, see Effective Summary Numbers.\u00a0\nThe following list provides general recommendations as to the most appropriate Summary Number aggregations for each chart type:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/configuring_your_chart_summary_number/index.html", "title": "Configuring Your Chart Summary Number"}, {"objectID": "0ca090cfe36c-7", "text": "Chart TypeRecommended Summary Number AggregationSingle BarSum, Avg, Min, or Max.

The header looks like this: \nauth: ABCDEFG8-ABCD-1234-5678-ABCDEF123456\nMore information about authentication can be found in the Echo API documentation under the Authorization\u00a0section.\nSteps to Connect\nTo connect to InContact Echo data,\u00a0\nCreate a new JSON Advanced connection\u00a0in Domo.In the Credentials section...Rename the title of the account provider from \"JSON Account\" to \"Blank\" to indicate no credentials are supplied in this section (instead the credentials will be provided in the HTTPS header section of the connector).Leave the\u00a0Username\u00a0and\u00a0Password\u00a0fields blank.Click Connect.\u00a0            The account provider \"Blank\" is\u00a0created.Click Save.In the Details section...In the What is the connection method to access the JSON file?\u00a0dropdown, select\u00a0HTTP Request.In the Enter the URL to Your JSON File\u00a0field, enter the requesting URL.            For instructions, refer to the Request\u00a0section of the API documentation.\u00a0  An example request URL would look like this:   https://echo.incontact.com/company/api/echoapi.taf?classname=surveys&method=getSurveyName&outputtype=JSON&p1=101", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/connecting_to_incontact_echo_data_in_domo/index.html", "title": "Connecting to InContact Echo Data in Domo"}, {"objectID": "2389f41a7744-1", "text": "Note:\u00a0To get the output as JSON, you must include the &outputtype=JSON parameter.\n\n\nIn the Do you require additional options? dropdown, select Yes.\u00a0In the HTTPS Headers\u00a0field, enter the API key received from InContact.            For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.Click Save.  Best PracticesA best practice when\u00a0connecting to InContact Echo\u00a0is to schedule it to run once a day on a full \"Replace.\" However, you can also run\u00a0on \"Append\" to provide a snapshot over time. There are no known limitations for the API so you may be able to schedule the connector to run up to 15 minutes;\u00a0however you should check with your InContact representative to find out if your particular account has API limits that would prevent that update frequency.The primary use of this API is to collect survey data. The endpoint for surveys is the https://echo.incontact.com/company/api/echoapi.taf?classname=surveys&method=getSurveyResults&p1=101 example. This is explained in the API documentation in\u00a0the SURVEYS/getSurveyResults\u00a0section. It is possible to grab multiple surveys in one API pull; this\u00a0is explained in the Requests\u00a0section of the API documentation.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/connecting_to_incontact_echo_data_in_domo/index.html", "title": "Connecting to InContact Echo Data in Domo"}, {"objectID": "848ba1f6a61f-0", "text": "Title\n\nConnecting to Informatica Cloud in Domo\n\nArticle Body", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/connecting_to_informatica_cloud_in_domo/index.html", "title": "Connecting to Informatica Cloud in Domo"}, {"objectID": "848ba1f6a61f-1", "text": "Installing the Informatica Cloud Secure Agent\nLog into Informatica Cloud using the username required and password required.Select Configure > Runtime Environments.

Continental and regional maps require only two data columns or rows from your DataSet. One column or row contains the names or two-letter ISO codes of the countries in the continent or region, and the other contains the values for each country. These values are represented in your map by varying shades of color, each of which corresponds to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet and are represented by a legend, which is automatically included beside the map.For information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: When multiple instances of a single region occur in a DataSet, the values for that region are summed to show a single value for the region in the map. For example, if your DataSet contained three rows for \"Georgia,\" the values for the rows would be summed, and the Georgia region in the map would show the total value. You cannot turn off this automatic aggregation in maps.\n\n\n\nFor information about world maps, see U.S. County Map.\nFor information about troubleshooting when an area in your map does not show data but there is data, see Troubleshooting\u00a0Domo.\nVideo - Map Charts\n\nPowering continental and regional maps\nIn the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your map.

These statements cause the server to make appropriate modifications to the underlying grant tables.By manipulating the Couchbase grant tables directly with statements such as\u00a0INSERT,\u00a0UPDATE, or\u00a0DELETE.\nThe preferred method is to use account management statements because they are more concise and less error-prone than manipulating the grant tables directly.\nAnother option for creating accounts is to use the GUI tool MySQL Workbench.

Browse the list below to see if we have a quick answer for you.\u00a0\nWhat is CourseBuilder?\nIt\u2019s an e-learning authoring tool that publishes training modules as apps to Domo. The best part is that it\u2019s available for download in the Domo Appstore\u2014for free.\nI\u2019m struggling with the download/launch process\u2026\nWe're sorry about that. Following the steps outlined in this article will help you get it up and running in moments.\nCan I use your training content, videos, and documentation in my trainings?\nYes, as long as you follow the stipulations of the Domo Services Agreement, which essentially requires that you only use our training assets for internal onboarding or training efforts and that these not be used for a for-profit venture outside of your licensed organization.\n\u00a0\nHow do I use Domo University videos in my apps?\nYou\u2019ll need to add video IDs to the appropriate field in CourseBuilder. Here\u2019s how to find those video IDs and make them work in your app:\nGo to\u00a0https://www.domo.com/help-center/videos.Search for and open the video that you want to include in your app.In the URL for that page, copy the last part of it. For example, you would copy the orange portion of the following URL: https://university.domo.com/videos/watch/cxaGNjODE6kFqCR61d-4E69XUwdn1h6UNext, in\u00a0a video page/template that you've created for your app in\u00a0CourseBuilder, set the Cloud\u00a0Video Provider to YouTube.Then, paste the copied videoID into the appropriate field.\nWhat cloud video services are available?\nYouTube, Vimeo, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Ooyala, Vidyard, and Verizon Digital Media Services.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/coursebuilder_faqs/index.html", "title": "CourseBuilder FAQs"}, {"objectID": "9303bece7834-1", "text": "Can I upload my own MP4 videos into apps?\nYes. In the Files view/tab in CourseBuilder, select Add File\u00a0and then go find and add the video file you want to import into your app. (Note: The\u00a0video file should be 50 MB or less in size. If it exceeds that size, it will likely\u00a0make it so you can't publish your app to Domo.)\u00a0Once you've imported the video file, create a video page or template, and in the Video Source dropdown menu, simply select Video File. Then, if you\u2019ve already uploaded the video, you will be able to select that video from a dropdown list and add it to your page template.\nCan I link to resources outside the Domo SSO (Single Sign On), such as Box?\nTypically, yes. However, some customer administrators have preemptively limited which outside domains can be linked to from within their Domo instance. An admin for your instance may need to whitelist certain Domains before users can access links to those domains from a CourseBuilder app.\nAre there any browser restrictions associated with CourseBuilder apps?\nYes. CourseBuilder is optimized specifically for Chrome. CourseBuilder apps also typically work well in Safari and, for the most part, Mozilla Firefox. However, CourseBuilder is not optimized for Internet Explorer browsers. If users access CourseBuilder apps via Internet Explorer, elements in the app UI and page functions may break down. For this reason, we strongly recommend users access CourseBuilder apps through Chrome and that they specifically avoid the use of Internet Explorer.\nAre there any other possible restrictions I should know about?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/coursebuilder_faqs/index.html", "title": "CourseBuilder FAQs"}, {"objectID": "9303bece7834-2", "text": "Are there any other possible restrictions I should know about?\nIf the user is logged into their company network via a proxy server or VPN, CourseBuilder may not allow the users to publish an app to a Domo instance. The user would need to log off of the VPN or proxy server and, instead, login to their instance on a standard network and publish the app to their instance from there.\nCan I make CourseBuilder apps go full screen within Domo?\nThis capability is not available at this time.\nI just imported an app into CourseBuilder, but it isn\u2019t working. Why?\nThere are a number of possible reasons. First, make sure the app you\u2019re trying to import was exported from CourseBuilder as an editable app. Second, ensure you selected the parent app folder and didn\u2019t double-click into that folder. For example, if I were importing an editable app named \u201cWorkbench Training\u201d into CourseBuilder, I would need to select Import, find the app project folder named \u201cWorkbench Training, select the project folder by clicking it once with the cursor, then select the Import button in the dialog box. If you double-click the app project folder, this will not initiate the upload. Rather, it will take you into the app project folder itself. If a user gets to this point, they might accidentally import only parts of the editable app but not the entire app project.\nWhy can't I add punctuation or other symbols in the name of my apps?\nCurrently, the name you give the app when you first create it is the name applied to the label for the folder housing app assets and files. Adding punctuation and symbols to this name causes errors in the import, export, and publishing process. While we're working on a solution, users will need to use names that do not include any punctuation or symbols until it is ready.\u00a0\nWhat is the difference between an editable export of an app, exporting the app, or publishing the app?", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/coursebuilder_faqs/index.html", "title": "CourseBuilder FAQs"}, {"objectID": "9303bece7834-3", "text": "The editable app that has been exported can be re-imported into CourseBuilder and allow the user to edit that app. Exporting the app (Option 3) exports a version of the app that can be edited by a developer and then published to Domo via a CLI (Command Line Interface). A published app is published to whatever instance you have credentials to access, and it places the app in your Asset Library within Domo.\nMy videos aren't working or showing up in the designated frame, or my MP4 videos aren't importing into my app.\nIf you are using a cloud video service provider,\u00a0ensure that you have copied the correct video ID in to the appropriate field and that you have\u00a0 chosen the correct cloud service provider. If you are trying to add a MP4 video, make sure the video file has \".mp4\" in the suffix and not something like \".mov\" or \".screenflow\". It is also possible that the size of your video is too big and that you need to resize the aspect ratio for the video, split up the video into two or more parts,\u00a0or compress that video. Here are some recommendations on reducing the file size of your video.\nBefore you import video files into CourseBuilder, ensure the file size of the video is 50 MB\u00a0(50,000 KB) or less. If the file size for your video exceeds this this limitation, it will likely be too large to import into CourseBuilder.

Only group owners may invite new members to a closed group. Owners must be named individuals or groups, and members must be named individuals.

You create membership policies\u00a0that reference trusted attributes; thereafter, Domo does the work of maintaining the membership. For example, you could create a dynamic group with a rule stating that all members must belong to the \"Marketing\" department.

It uses a SQL script-based transformation interface, similar to MySQL DataFlows. Adrenaline DataFlows allow you to rapidly summarize and aggregate massive DataSets into smaller, more performant outputs. Adrenaline DataFlows are able to deliver high-performance by leveraging architectural investments and performance improvements made to Domo's Adrenaline engine over time.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote: This feature is available on demand and paid. \n\u00a0\nTo\u00a0request this feature be enabled,\nReach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager, Technical Consultant, or Account Executive.If you do not have contact information for your CSM, TC, or AE, contact Technical Support.

We recommend Adrenaline DataFlows for the following use cases:\n1. Building high-performance Dashboards from massive DataSets. Instead of directly building cards off such large DataSets, we recommend using Adrenaline DataFlows to create summarized and aggregated smaller outputs which should then be used to power fast, high-performance dashboards. For cases where access to the full data is needed, we recommend setting up Drill Paths to the original DataSet from the visualizations built from the summarized DataFlow outputs.\n2.

You\u00a0can be Alerted based on any change or addition to your data. Unlike traditional Alerts, these can be built on multiple trigger rules. And the Alert message can include complex calculations and even data from other DataSets, making the custom message more customizable\u00a0and more useful. \u00a0\nFor example, let's say user Barry is a sales manager for his company. He wants to know the exact moment that a new deal closes, along with any pertinent information about the deal, such as the salesperson who closed the deal, the name of the customer, the amount of the deal, the number of consulting hours purchased, and so on. Before DataSet Alerts, Barry could only set Alerts on the Card level. These Alerts would indicate that a predefined threshold had been surpassed but could not relay any other data from the DataSet. But now, with DataSet Alerts, Barry can set an Alert on the DataSet level. The Alert message can include any information from the DataSet, including all of the data Barry wanted.\u00a0\nBarry's Alert message as created in Domo\u00a0looks as follows:\n[Sales Rep], on the [Sales Team] team, closed a deal with [Account Name] for [Deal Amount]. This deal includes [# of Users] users and [# of Consulting Hours Purchased] consulting hours (at a rate of [Consulting Rate] per hour). The competitor for this deal was [Competitor Name]. This opportunity was created on [Opportunity Start Date] from a [Lead Type].\nThereafter, when a deal closes, the Alert message that is sent out is populated with the data from the indicated columns.

In this tab you can also click\u00a0New Alert\u00a0to open the 3-step Alert wizard, where\u00a0you can configure your\u00a0new Alert.\u00a0The steps in the wizard are as follows:\nRule.\u00a0Here you specify the conditions that trigger your Alert.

To do this, you choose the desired column in the\u00a0Metric\u00a0menu, select an operator in the\u00a0Meets this condition menu, then enter or select the desired value in the\u00a0For this value\u00a0field. So for example, if user Fiona only wants to receive Alerts when the \"Marketing\" department is impacted, she would select\u00a0Department\u00a0in the first menu and\u00a0Is equal to\u00a0(=)\u00a0in the second menu, then check the box for \"Marketing\" in the blank field.You can add additional filters by clicking\u00a0Add Filter.\u00a0\nBy adding multiple filters, you can build complex Alert rules for your DataSets. For example, let's say I have a DataSet\u00a0that includes rows for customer deals in the pipeline. I want to receive an Alert\u00a0only\u00a0when these three criteria are met:\nI have won the deal (indicated by the \"isWon\" column being set to \"True\").The deal was previously open (indicated by the \"isClosed\" column being previously set to \"False\").The deal is now closed (indicated by the \"isClosed\" column being now set to \"True\").\nI could build a single rule incorporating all three of these criteria. by creating three separate filters, as follows:\n\u00a0\nThe second option asks you to select\u00a0one or more columns that identify a row in this DataSet as unique. In the previous example, I specified \"AccountID\" as this column because the account ID is unique for every row.

The sum of all of the values in the column.Standard Deviation. The standard deviation of the values in the column.Median. The median value in the column.Lower Quartile. The lower quartile for the column.Upper Quartile. The upper quartile for the column.\nOnce you choose the column and aggregation, you can build the conditional statement for the Alert.\u00a0A conditional statement connects the selected metric to the value or percentage and determines when your Alert is sent. You choose the condition in the\u00a0Meets this condition\u00a0menu and enter the value in the\u00a0For this value\u00a0field.\u00a0Domo provides a variety of conditions to choose from, including greater than, less than, and equal statements and combinations of these. You can also specify a particular degree of change using the changes by, increases by, and decreases by condition statements.\nFor example, if you wanted to create an Alert set to trigger when the total value of the \"Budget\" column fell below $10,000, you would do the following:\nSelect \"Budget\" in the\u00a0Metric\u00a0menu, then choose\u00a0Sum\u00a0as the aggregation type.Select\u00a0is less than (<)\u00a0in the\u00a0Meets this condition\u00a0menu.Enter 10000 in the\u00a0For this value\u00a0field.\u00a0\nSpecifying the Alert Frequency", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/creating_an_alert_for_a_dataset/index.html", "title": "Creating an Alert for a DataSet"}, {"objectID": "974a2ab209cb-9", "text": "Specifying the Alert Frequency\nAlso in step 1 of the Alert wizard, you can specify how often Domo\u00a0checks to see if the Alert is in a triggered state.\u00a0You do this by clicking the arrow at the bottom right of the configuration options and selecting the desired option.\u00a0\n\u00a0Options include\u00a0Every time the data updates,\u00a0Hourly,\u00a0Daily,\u00a0Weekly, and\u00a0Monthly.\u00a0\nIf you select\u00a0Every time the data updates, Domo checks the Alert any time the data in the card is refreshed.\u00a0If you select\u00a0Hourly\u00a0or Daily, you can choose whether to include weekends in your evaluation.\u00a0You can also set the specific time of day when you choose\u00a0Daily.If you select\u00a0Weekly, you can select the specific day of the week along with the time of day.If you select\u00a0Monthly, you can select a specific date or the first/last day of the month, along with the time of day.\u00a0\u00a0\nDepending on the Alert condition you've selected, a checkbox may also appear reading\u00a0Keep sending notifications while in a triggered state. When this box is checked, instead of sending out a single Notification as soon as the Alert enters a triggered state (which is the default functionality), Domo\u00a0sends out Notifications based on the selected frequency\u00a0until the Alert conditions are no longer met. For example, let's say user Gus creates the Alert rule \"Summary Number is less than 500,\" selects Weekly\u00a0as the frequency, then checks this box.

You can choose from a wide variety of macros to include in the message. Macros are used to reference different variables related to your Alert, such as Alert name, Alert owner, current or previous value of the rule column, the time the Alert was last triggered at, and so on.

You are then taken to a three-step \"New Alert\" wizard in which you can create your Alert. The steps in the wizard are as follows:\nSet up your Alert rule.\u00a0Here you specify the conditions that trigger your Alert. You can also specify how often Domo checks to see if the Alert conditions have been met.Compose a Notification message. Here you can customize the message for the Alert using a variety of different macros to indicate available metrics.Share this Alert. Here you specify the users, groups, and Buzz conversations\u00a0that receive Notifications when the Alert is triggered.\u00a0\nAll of these steps are described in more detail in continuation.\nSetting up your Alert rule\nIn Step 1 of the wizard, you specify the conditions that cause your Alert to trigger. You can also set the frequency at which Domo\u00a0checks to see if the Alert has triggered.\nIf PDP policies have been set on the DataSet for the Card, you can specify how PDP\u00a0is applied to Alerts in Step 1 of the wizard. For more information, see\u00a0PDP and Alerts.\u00a0\nIf the data in the Card is filtered via either Page or Card\u00a0Filters, you are given the option to specify whether the Alert is applied to the filtered or unfiltered version of the Card.\u00a0\nSpecifying the Alert conditions\u00a0\u00a0\nAlerts are made up of the following parts:", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/creating_an_alert_for_a_visualization_card/index.html", "title": "Creating an Alert for a Visualization Card"}, {"objectID": "b13135a0b673-2", "text": "Specifying the Alert conditions\u00a0\u00a0\nAlerts are made up of the following parts:\nThe item being measured (the \"metric\").\u00a0This could be a specific category or series in your chart, the current value of the chart, or the total of all items in the chart. It could also be a calculation applied to a specific category or series. For example, you could apply an \"Average\" calculation to a given category, then configure your Alert to trigger whenever that value fell below a specified threshold. Domo provides a number of such calculations, from simple arithmetic operations like \"Sum of\" to advanced statistical operations such as \"Skewness of\" and \"Kurtosis of.\" \u00a0A conditional statement that connects the measure to the value or percentage and determines when your Alert is sent.\u00a0Domo provides a variety of condition statements to choose from, including greater than, less than, and equal statements and combinations of these. You can also specify a particular degree of change using the changes by, increases by, and decreases by condition statements.The numerical value or percentage used as the threshold in your Alert.\nYou can build an Alert by specifying these components in the three fields in Step 1 (\"Rule\") of the Alert wizard.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the preceding screenshot, the user has selected\u00a0Poor Customer Service\u00a0(Most recent month)\u00a0as the measure and Increases by (+ %)\u00a0as the conditional statement, and has entered 5 as the numerical value. This Alert triggers when the \"Poor Customer Service (Most recent month)\" percentage increases by 5%.\u00a0\nSpecifying the Alert frequency\nAlso in this tab, you can specify how often Domo\u00a0checks checks to see if the Alert is in a triggered state.\u00a0You do this by clicking the arrow at the bottom right of the configuration options and selecting the desired option.\u00a0\n\u00a0Options include\u00a0Every time the data updates,\u00a0Hourly,\u00a0Daily,\u00a0Weekly, and\u00a0Monthly.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/creating_an_alert_for_a_visualization_card/index.html", "title": "Creating an Alert for a Visualization Card"}, {"objectID": "b13135a0b673-3", "text": "If you select\u00a0Every time the data updates, Domo checks the Alert any time the data in the Card is refreshed.\u00a0If you select\u00a0Hourly\u00a0or Daily, you can choose whether to include weekends in your evaluation.\u00a0You can also set the specific time of day when you choose\u00a0Daily.If you select\u00a0Weekly, you can select the specific day of the week along with the time of day.If you select\u00a0Monthly, you can select a specific date or the first/last day of the month, along with the time of day.\u00a0\u00a0\nDepending on the Alert condition you've selected, a checkbox may also appear reading\u00a0Keep sending Notifications while in a triggered state. When this box is checked, instead of sending out a single Notification as soon as the Alert enters a triggered state (which is the default functionality), Domo\u00a0sends out Notifications based on the selected frequency\u00a0until the Alert conditions are no longer met. For example, let's\u00a0user Gus creates the Alert rule \"Summary number is greater than 500,\" selects Weekly\u00a0as the frequency, then checks this box. As soon as the summary number surpasses 500, a Notification is sent. Then, as long as the summary number remains above 500, new Notifications are sent on the specified weekday at the specified time. If the number drops below 500, Notifications will stop being sent. If, on the other hand, Gus doesn't check this box, only an initial Notification is sent when the Alert is triggered.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/creating_an_alert_for_a_visualization_card/index.html", "title": "Creating an Alert for a Visualization Card"}, {"objectID": "b13135a0b673-4", "text": "The\u00a0Keep sending Notifications while in a triggered state\u00a0checkbox appears only for threshold-based Alerts, as opposed to those one-time Alerts that trigger when a certain degree of change is met. For example, for an \"Is greater than\" Alert (e.g. an Alert that triggers when its value surpasses 1000), this box would be available because the Alert still applies as long as the value remains above the threshold. But for a \"Changes by\"\u00a0Alert, the box is not available because once the given value is reached, only a single Notification needs be sent\u2014the Alert's work is then done.\nDetermining whether to honor Filters\nIf filters have been set on this Card on either the Page or Card level, an option appears allowing you to toggle whether those filters are honored in the Alert. If you uncheck the box, the Alert will be applied to the unfiltered version of the Card. You can click the\u00a0Show filters option to see the currently applied filters.\u00a0\u00a0\nCustomizing your Alert message\nIn Step 2 of the wizard, you can customize the Notification message that is sent whenever the Alert is triggered. You can choose from a wide variety of macros to include in the message. Macros are used to reference different variables related to your Alert, such as Alert name, previous or current value, Alert owner, change in Alert value, and so on. For example, in the default Notification message that appears when you enter Step 2, macros are used to indicate the Alert rule as configured in Step 1 of the wizard, the name of the Card in which the Alert is found, the previous Alert value, and the current Alert value.", "source": "../../raw_kb/article/creating_an_alert_for_a_visualization_card/index.html", "title": "Creating an Alert for a Visualization Card"}, {"objectID": "b13135a0b673-5", "text": "In the left panel of the wizard, under \"Message,\" you can see the Notification message with the variables switched in for the macros.
