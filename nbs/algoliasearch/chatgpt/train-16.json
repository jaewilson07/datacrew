In SQL and Magic ETL\u00a0DataFlows, the result of any comparison with null is always null, which is treated by the Filter Rows tile like a false result. In most contexts in Magic ETL, null is not equal to null, but null is also not not equal to null; null is not greater than zero, but it is also not less than zero, nor is it equal to zero. If you have nulls in columns referenced by Filter Rows tiles, all of those rows will be dropped, regardless of the function or its other argument. The only functions that can deal with nulls truthfully are \u201cis null\u201d and \u201cis not null\u201d. In v1, a filter might have tested \u201ccolumn = null\u201d.

The Filter Rows tile is one of three tiles (Group By and Add Formula being the other two) which supports formula evaluation. The IFNULL() function works particularly well for handling a null result from a filter expression. For example, if column \u201ccol\u201d has null values, and we want to filter for rows whose value for \u201ccol\u201d is not 5, preserving our nulls, we could write this expression: IFNULL(col <> 5, TRUE)\nBesides null handling, there are many other scenarios that filter formulas make easier.

Because of this mathematical plotting, there are not evenly spaced intervals between data points as there are in graphs that use date/time data; therefore, these graphs are useful for portraying trendlines with greater accuracy.\u00a0\nA basic XY Line chart includes only one line, but you can also include a series column to show multiple lines. You can also add a line for a median value and specify lower and upper range values. Be aware that this chart type does not currently include algorithms to identify your median line and upper and lower ranges. You must identify these elements yourself in the DataSet you use to power the graph. However, you can use tools such as R and Python to help you identify these elements.\nPowering XY Line Charts\nXY Line charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet to create a trendline, but if you want to include optional elements such as multiple lines, a median line, etc., more columns are required. The following list describes all of the columns you can apply in an XY Line chart:\nA column with X coordinate values for the\u00a0trendline(s) (required).A column with Y coordinate values for the trendline(s) (required).A column with series data, used to add multiple trendlines (optional).A column with Y coordinate values for the median line (optional).A column with Y coordinate values for the upper range (optional).A column with Y coordinate values for the lower range (optional).\nFor an example of how to set up your data, see the graphic below.\u00a0\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see Understanding Chart Data.\nIn the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your XY graph.

General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector.\nBest practices\nWhen you first power up the Connector and request historical data, it takes around 30 days to bring in all the data. This is due to how the YouTube API functions. For example, if a report is first started on April 1, data from April 1 onward will be available 24-48 hours later. Every day, a few more days prior to April 1 will be available. After around 30 days, 6 months of backfill data will have been added to the report (though it comes in a rather sporadic order).

Historical reports are posted as soon as they are available and in no particular order. It takes roughly one month for all of the historical data to be posted for a job.

These accounts have access to multiple channels instead of just their default one.\nMy YouTube account has access to my company's Content Management account.
