Intro
-----


Gauges are simple charts that indicate progress towards meeting a target. Comparative fill gaugesÂ are similar toÂ [filled gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Filled+gauge "Filled Gauge") but more complex.Â Whereas a filled gauge shows you only the current value, a comparative fill gauge also showsÂ the previous value.Â This allowsÂ viewersÂ to see the degree of change since the gauge was last updated. In addition,Â the percentage and direction of changeÂ appears in the center of the chart.Â You canÂ also specify anÂ optionalÂ target value in a comparative fillÂ gauge.Â 


Comparative fill gauges come in two types: basic and advanced. These are the same except that the advanced type includes additional parameters not available in the basic version. For example, you can create ranges and specify median values. These elements are displayedÂ on a second circle in the gauge for a cleaner look.Â 


Other gauge types in Domo include [single value gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Single+Value+gauge "Single Value Gauge"), [radial gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Radial+gauge "Radial Gauge"), [face gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Face+gauge "Face Gauge"), and [progress bar gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Progress+Bar+gauge "Progress Bar Gauge").


Powering comparative fill gauges
--------------------------------


AÂ basic comparative fillÂ gauge requiresÂ four columns or rows of data from your DataSet. These columns or rows are as follows:



* One contains the minimum or lowest valueÂ that appears on theÂ gauge.
* One contains the maximum or highest value that appears onÂ the gauge.
* One contains the current value for the gauge.
* One contains theÂ previous value for the gauge.


An advanced comparative fill gaugeÂ requires all of the above columns, along with the following:



* A column with a lower range value.
* A column with an upper range value.
* A column with a median value.


WithÂ both basic and advanced comparative fill gauges, you canÂ also include an optional target value column.Â 


The following screenshot points out all of these elements inÂ an advanced comparative fill gauge, along with the percentage and direction of change (which is calculated automatically based on your previous and current values):

If multiple rows are present in your DataSet, only the *first* row is used. No aggregations occur.


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for yourÂ comparative fillÂ gauge. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


Customizing comparative fill gauges
-----------------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a comparative fill gauge by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see [Properties for Gauges](..\properties_for_gauges\index.html "Chart Properties").




| Property | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General > Color Direction | Determines whether green fill indicates positive (default) or negative change in the gauge. WhenÂ positive change is denoted by green, negative change is denoted by red. Alternatively,Â if youÂ specify that negative change is denoted by green, then positiveÂ change is denoted by red. Â 
In the example at right, the user has selected **Negative is Green** for this property. Thus, because the percent change is positive, the color fill is red. | comparative_fill_gauge_positive_red.png |
