You can see what groups a user belongs to in theÂ GroupsÂ pane in his or herÂ ProfileÂ page. For more information about groups, see [Creating and Managing User Groups](/s/article/360043438913 "Managing Users and Groups").


**To see what groups a user belongs to,**


1. Open the user'sÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking his or her profile picture anywhere that it appears and clickingÂ **Go to Profile**Â in the avatar card.
2. Click theÂ **Groups**Â hyperlink.  
 The Groups pane appears on screen. This pane contains the names of all the groups this user belongs to. You can mouse over any group to pop up a list of all members of that group.
