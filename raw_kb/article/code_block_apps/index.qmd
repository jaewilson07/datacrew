Intro
-----


Code Block apps allow you to quickly find and copy sample code that you can use forÂ R, Python, or Beast Mode applications. Code Block apps in DomoÂ make advanced functionality more accessible allowingÂ you to spendÂ more time collaborating around your data and business questions rather than determining how to best write code.


Code Block Apps
---------------


You can find Code Block apps by navigating to the [Appstore](..\appstore_overview\index.html "Appstore Overview")Â and simply searching for Code Block. In the App Details view, seen below, you can either copy directly from the code block or clickÂ the Copy to Clipboard button. Then, paste the code in the medium you're working in, adjust the columns and parameters to align with your data, and you're ready to go.
