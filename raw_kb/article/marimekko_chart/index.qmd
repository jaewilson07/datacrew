Intro
-----


A Marimekko chart is similar to a [pie chart](..\pie_chart\index.html "100% Stacked Bar Graph"). It is different in that it represents values through column width as well as height, making it easier to see differences in the values of different items.


As with other kinds of bar charts, both vertical and horizontal versions of Marimekko charts are available. In vertical Marimekko charts, series in categories are "stacked" on top of each other; in horizontal Marimekko charts, the series appear side by side.


By default the values on the y-axis appear with percent symbols. You can change this behavior in the **Chart Properties** if you want. For more information, seeÂ [Formatting Values in Your Chart](..\formatting_values_in_your_chart\index.html "Formatting Values in Your Chart").


Use CasesÂ
----------


Marimekko charts are often usedÂ for showing market share snapshots, such as in the following example:Â

 Â 


Limitations
-----------


Note that MarimekkoÂ charts may be hard to read, especially when there are many segments. Also, because segments do not have a common baseline, it canÂ be difficult for viewers to make accurate comparisons between segments. Therefore, MarimekkoÂ charts are usually better for providingÂ a more general overview of the data.


Powering Marimekko charts
-------------------------


A Marimekko chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSetâ€”one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer,Â you choose the columns containing the data for your Marimekko chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\analyzer_overview\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer").

Customizing Marimekko charts
----------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a Marimekko chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see [Chart Properties](..\applying_and_resetting_chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties"). Unique properties of Marimekko charts include the following:




| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General > Sort on Totals | Allows you to sort categories in many kinds of bar and lollipop charts by their total values, in either ascending or descending order. If you selectÂ ****Default****, the default sort is applied. This option does not work when the chart has automatic time scaling applied. (You can turn off automatic time scaling by checking the box forÂ ****Category Scale > Never Use Time Scale****. |
