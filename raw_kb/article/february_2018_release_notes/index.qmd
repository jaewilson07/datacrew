New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### New File Upload Connector


The new version of the File Upload connector provides an intuitive workflow to make even the most complicated Excel or CSV files usable within Domo. Due to Excel's nature as an extremely extensible product, there are nearly endless combinations of formatting and configurations that you can use in order to make your data actionable. With the new File Upload connector, you can maintain all of the organization and configuration of your custom Excel or CSV files and still have usable data within Domo. Requiring virtually no input, the Excel/CSV Upload Wizard does the heavy lifting for you when you need to leverage the power of your Excel or CSV data in Domo.

For more information, see [File Upload Connector](..\file_upload_connector\index.html "File Upload Connector").


### Domo Skills


DomoÂ Skills empowers new Freemium users to understand the fundamentals of Domo. To set these users up for success, they are walked through a series of skills that have been shown to be critical tasks in determining Domo's value to the customer. They learn how to connect data, create cards, and organize dashboards through a series of guided challenges. A progress bar encourages them through this journey toward success in Domo.Â 


The Domo Skills feature is presented after sign-up to new English language Freemium customers.Â

### SAML RelayState Redirect Option


We have shipped a fix to SSOÂ that enables loading of multiple cards on the same page using Domo Everywhere: Domo Embed. To allow this, we have repurposed the SAML "RelayState" tag. You can enableÂ thisÂ behavior by checking theÂ **Use SAML RelayState to redirect**Â checkbox inÂ **Admin > Security Settings > Single Sign-On (SSO)**.Â Any customers who have built a custom SAML solution to support Domo embed will likely want to make use of this feature. If this feature doesn't work with your setup, there is fallback logic to continue using the previous method for redirects.
