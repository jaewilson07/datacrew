Intro
-----


Pareto charts are single-series bar charts with categories ordered according to the size of their data items (largest to smallest). A line above the bars shows the cumulative value of all of the data items to that point. A Pareto chart has two scalesâ€”one on the left that shows the actual data values, and one on the right that measures percentages of the total value of the data series.


Powering Pareto charts
----------------------


Pareto charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”one for categories and one for values. The values in the values column are used to create both of the vertical scales in the chart. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Pareto chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder](..\analyzer_overview\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Pareto chart:

Customizing Pareto charts
-------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a Pareto chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ  [Chart Properties](..\applying_and_resetting_chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
