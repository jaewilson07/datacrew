In theÂ ProfileÂ page, you have the ability to connect to any of a number of social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. When you connect to a social network, a feed for that social network appears at the bottom of theÂ ProfileÂ page. Visitors to yourÂ ProfileÂ can view your social activity and photos for each network. Feeds may also provide options such as marking posts as Favorites, "retweeting," linking to Instagram photos, and so on. You can also disconnect from a social network.


**To connect to a social network,**


1. Open yourÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, aÂ ![](0.png)Â icon appears instead.)
2. ClickÂ Social NetworksÂ in the navigation bar under the profile header.

2. ClickÂ **Disconnect**.
3. ClickÂ **Disconnect**Â to confirm.


You can also send a user a reminder to connect to a particular social network. You do this by clicking the button for the desired network in theÂ **Social Networks**Â area of the profile header.

Buttons for networks that have not yet been connected appear gray, and those that have already been connected appear blue. Clicking a blue button takes you directly to the feed for that network at the bottom of theÂ ProfileÂ page. Clicking a gray button brings up a dialogue with a customizable reminder message. When you send this message, it appears in the user'sÂ Buzz feed. For more information about Buzz, seeÂ [Buzz](..\..\category\buzz\index.html "Buzz").


**To send a reminder to connect a social network,**


1. Click the button for the unconnected network.  
 A dialogue opens, with the name of the user entered in theÂ **ToÂ**field by default.
2. (Optional) To send this reminder to multiple people, click in theÂ **To**Â field and select the name of the desired recipient.
3. (Optional) Customize the message if desired.
4. ClickÂ **Send Message**.
