For more information about the document preview mode, seeÂ [Previewing a Document](..\previewing_a_document\index.html "Previewing a Document").Â For information about attaching files when creating aÂ Buzz post, see Chatting in Buzz.

**Note:** In the interest of preventing users from uploading malicious files into Domo accounts, Domo allows a specific set of file types to be uploaded. If you attempt to upload a file not within this list, an error message appears. For more information, see [Permitted File Types for Attachments](..\permitted_file_types_for_attachments\index.html "Permitted File Types for Attachments").
