When building KPI cards in Domo, always adhere to the following practices:



* Be sure to include the following information in the [description](..\editing_the_name_or_description_of_a_visualization_card\index.qmd "Editing the Name or Description of a KPI Card"):



	+ The business initiative
	+ The card's strategic importance
	+ Actions the user can take based on this data
	+ Helpful [alerts](..\managing_your_alerts\index.qmd "Notifications and Alerts") the user can set
	+ The date range
	+ [Drilldown options](..\adding_a_drill_path_to_your_chart\index.qmd "Adding Drill Path to Your Chart") for the card
	+ The refresh rate
	+ Who the card is audited by  
	   
	![Card_Description.jpg](Card_Description.jpg)
* Use an appropriate chart type with...



	+ [A descriptive title](..\editing_the_name_or_description_of_a_visualization_card\index.qmd "Editing the Name or Description of a KPI Card")
	+ [Named axes](..\adding_scale_labels_to_your_charts\index.qmd "Adding Scale Titles to Your Chart")
	+ Consistent [formatting](..\best_practices_for_standardizing_visualization_cards\index.qmd "Chart Properties") with other cards in the collection (for example, blue line = forecast, green bar = current, and so on)
	+ A [goal line](..\adding_a_goal_line_to_your_chart\index.qmd "Adding a Goal Line to Your Chart") if there is a goal associated with the data
* Use an appropriate [summary number](..\configuring_your_chart_summary_number\index.qmd "Configuring Your Chart Summary Number") for the data represented in the card.
* Ensure the card is [linked to other appropriate content](..\linking_related_cards\index.qmd "Linking Related Cards") that applies to the same business question.
* Ensure the card is assigned to the appropriate [owner](..\changing_a_card_owner\index.qmd "Changing a Card Owner") (the person responsible for answering questions about the card).
