In theÂ ProfileÂ page, you can add or change the background image that appears at the top of the page. You can upload as many background images to Domo as you want. Domo stores all of your background images, and you can choose a new stored image (or upload a new image to your store of images) whenever you want. When you select an image for uploading, Domo gives you options to crop and rotate it before you upload it. You can also delete any image you've uploaded.


You can only add and edit background images on your own Profile page, even if you have an "Admin" default security role.Â
