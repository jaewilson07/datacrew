You connect to your DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers account and create a DataSet, you must have a Google username and password.Â 


Connecting to Your DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers Account
--------------------------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


The Domo DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. ClickÂ **Connect**Â (or selectÂ **Add Account**Â ifÂ you haveÂ existing DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers accounts in Domo) to open the GoogleÂ OAuth screen where you can enter your Google username and password. Once you have entered valid GoogleÂ credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new DoubleClick Ad Exchange for Sellers DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in theÂ **Accounts**Â tab in theÂ Data Center. For more information about this tab, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


**Note:**Â If you are already logged into Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click **Add account**. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Google.
