Intro
-----


Humanity (formerly called ShiftPlanning) is an online workforce management and scheduling system designed to help users easily manage time clock, attendance, human resources and payroll.Â Use Domo'sÂ HumanityÂ connector to retrieve data about schedules, employees, notifications, and so on.Â For more information about the HumanityÂ API, visitÂ their website.Â ([https://www.Humanity.com/api/](https://www.shiftplanning.com/api/ "https://www.shiftplanning.com/api/"))


The Humanity connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking **Cloud App** in the toolbar at the top of the window. Â Â 


You connect to yourÂ Humanity account in theÂ Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to theÂ HumanityÂ connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to yourÂ Humanity account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:Â 



* A HumanityÂ username and password.
* The API key for your Humanity account. You can find this by logging into your HumanityÂ account and navigating toÂ **Admin > Data API**.Â Â


Connecting to YourÂ Humanity Account
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in theÂ **Credentials**Â andÂ **Details**Â panes in theÂ HumanityÂ Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page,Â **Scheduling**Â andÂ **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to yourÂ HumanityÂ account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter your Humanity username.Â  |
| PasswordÂ  | Enter your HumanityÂ password.Â  |
| API Key | Enter the API key for your HumanityÂ account. For information about obtaining an API key, see "Prerequisites," above. |


Once you have entered valid HumanityÂ credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new HumanityÂ DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in theÂ **Accounts**Â tab in theÂ Data Center. For more information about this tab, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Report**Â menu in which you select a report categoryÂ and anÂ **Action**Â menu in which you select a specific report within that category. For example, if you selected **Admin**Â in theÂ **Report**Â menu, you could then selectÂ **Backups**,Â **Files**,Â or **Settings**Â in theÂ **Action**Â menu as your specific report.Â Depending on the optionsÂ you select in these menus, other options may be available.
