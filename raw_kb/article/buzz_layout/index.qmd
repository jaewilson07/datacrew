Intro
-----


Buzz consists of the followingÂ panes:



* A navigation paneÂ that lists all of your conversations and provides access to different options.
* A conversation paneÂ in which the selected conversation appears.Â
* AÂ detailsÂ pane where you can view information about the selected conversationÂ and configure settings.
* A "Flag for follow-up" pane in which you can view all conversations you have flagged for further review.
* A "Discover" pane that shows trending topics, online users, recent conversations, etc.


By default, only one pane appears on the right side of the screen when you open Domo; however, you can toggleÂ the full-screen mode for BuzzÂ by doing any of the following:



* Entering Ctrl + Alt + x on your keyboard.
* SelectingÂ **Toggle Fullscreen**Â in theÂ **Buzz**Â menu at the top of Buzz.Â


In this mode, the conversation and Buzz menu panes are both open by default. You can also open the details pane by clicking ![buzz_details_icon_new.png](buzz_details_icon_new.png)Â in the conversation pane.Â 


You can also enlarge the Buzz panel view by dragging the left edge of the panel as wide as you want.


The main interface components of Buzz are the same in the web and desktop versions. The only difference is that the desktop version includes additional options in a toolbar. For more information, see [Desktop version toolbar options](index.html "Buzz Layout").

Buzz Menu, Status, and Universal Compose
----------------------------------------


In the black bar at the top of Buzz, you can access theÂ **Buzz**Â menu, which includes a number of general-purpose settings options, as well as the Universal Compose icon. This bar is available in every pane in Buzz, so you can take advantage of these options no matter where you are.Â 


Â 


![Buzz_Menu.png](Buzz_Menu.png)Â Â 


#### Buzz Menu


In the Buzz menu, you have access to the following options:



* **Update your status.** Set your status to Available, Busy, Away, or Out of office. You can also add a custom message to your status when you are unavailable.
* **Toggle Fullscreen**. Toggles full-screen mode for Buzz. In this view, all three panels are displayed at once across the screen. You can also toggle full-screen modeÂ by entering Ctrl + Alt + x on your keyboard.
* **Mark All as Read.Â**ThisÂ lets you mark all messages as read, thereby removing all notifications for unread messages.
* **Manage Settings**. Opens your [Notification Settings](..\configuring_notification_and_alert_settings\index.html "Configuring Notification and Alert Settings").
* **Show Keyboard Shortcuts**. Opens a list of keyboard shortcuts for use in Buzz.Â
* **Email to Buzz**. Lets you convert an email message into a Buzz conversation. For more information, seeÂ [Importing an Email Thread into Buzz](..\importing_an_email_thread_into_buzz\index.html "Importing an Email Thread into Buzz").
* **Download the Buzz App**. Lets you download the desktop version of Buzz to your computer. For more information, seeÂ [Downloading and Running the Buzz Desktop Version](..\downloading_and_running_the_buzz_desktop_version\index.html "Downloading and Running the Buzz Desktop Version").


#### Status


Update your status on web or mobile to **Available**, **Busy**, **Away**, or **Out of the office**. When someone sends you a 1:1 message or @mentions you in a conversation and your status is set to something other than Available, they will see a warning message that states you are unavailable. You can add custom messaging to your status message when you are unavailable as well as assign a delegate when you are **Out of office**. An icon on your avatar indicates your current status. When your status is set to **Available**, a colored dot will show on your avatar, Green indicates you are Available and have been interacting with Domo. Yellow indicates that you Available, but have not been active within Domo recently. Gray means you are logged out of Domo. These colors are automatically updated by the system based on your activity inside of Domo.

#### Universal Compose


Universal Compose lets you compose a Buzz message from anywhere in BuzzÂ without first having to locate and open a conversation. You can start a conversation from scratch by searching for the people or groups you want to message. Or, you can add a message onto an existing conversation by searching for the conversation.


This dialog opens when you click theÂ ![buzz_universal_compose_icon.png](buzz_universal_compose_icon.png)Â icon that appears over any pane in Buzz OR when you clickÂ ![](5.png) icon in the **Conversations**Â area in the navigation pane. Here you can initiate a public or private conversation with select individuals or groups or open an existing conversation you are already included in and contribute to it.


The following screenshot points out the most important parts of this dialog:  
Â

You can click a message to open it in the conversation pane so you can take action on it. Or, if you have already taken the necessary action, you can unflag it by clicking its "x" icon (causing it to be removed from theÂ **Flag for follow-up**Â pane).Â

Conversation Pane

The conversation pane is the heart of Buzz. Here you can engage in conversations with the individuals and groups you choose.


The following screenshot points out the most important features of the conversationÂ pane. In full-screen mode, this is the pane that appears in the center.  
Â

Â 


You can learn more about these components in the following table:




| ComponentÂ  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Conversation name | The name of this conversation. Conversations based around people (rather than cards, pages, etc.) takeÂ the name of the people and/or groups included in the conversation, while dataÂ conversations based around data elements such as pages and cards takeÂ the name of the elements (card, page, project, etc.) they areÂ tied to.Â  |
| Back button | OpensÂ the [Buzz menu](index.html "Buzz Layout"). In full-screen mode this icon does not appear. Â  |
| Favorite icon | Lets you add this conversation as a favorite. You can then access it quickly under the **Favorites**Â filter in your Buzz menu. |
| Participating users | Indicates the number of users who are included in this conversation. Click to see the names of all of the included users. |
| Video chat icon | Lets you start a video chat with the users in the conversation. For more information, see Using Video Chat in Buzz.Â  |
| Threads toggle | Shows all of the threads (side conversations) for this conversation. You can click a thread to open just that thread in the conversation pane. |
| Details icon | Opens the Conversation DetailsÂ for the conversation. |
| Channel type | Indicates the type of conversation. Conversation types include the following:
* Public Channel â€” The conversation is open to all users in your Domo.

* Group Conversation â€” The conversation is between three or more people (Domo groups may or may not be included).
* Page Channel â€” The conversation is associated with a specific page.
* Card Channel â€” The conversation is associated with a specific card.
* Project Channel â€” The conversation is associated with a specific project.

Furthermore, each of these can have "threads"â€”side conversations that break off of the original conversation. If anyone from the original conversation can view the thread, it is simply called a "thread." If the thread is limited to certain people, it is called a "private thread." |
| Bot message | Indicates a message that has appeared automatically in this conversation as a result of a connected Bot. For more information about Bots, see [Adding a Bot to Buzz](..\adding_a_bot_to_buzz\index.html "Adding a Bot to Buzz"). |
| Emoji | ShowsÂ user reactions to this message. You can add an emoji after a message by mousing over the message, clicking , then selecting the desired emoji. You can also "agree" with an existing emoji by clicking on it. This raises the value of the emoji by 1. If you click an emoji a second time, your "agreement" is cancelled and the value decreases by 1. |
| Timestamp | Shows when a comment was added to this conversation. |
| Quoted message | Indicates a message from earlier in this conversation that has been "re-quoted." You can quote a message in a conversation by mousing over the conversation and clicking Â .Â  |

When you mouse over a post in a conversation, an options panel appears:
buzz_conversation_options_2018.png
The three most commonly used options appear here; you can also click the ellipsis icon (...) to view several more. The following table describes the available options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Like iconÂ  | Lets you "like" this message. If the message has not yet been liked, a "like" emoji appears and the value is set to 1. If the message has already been liked, the emoji's value is raised by 1. |
| Quote iconÂ  | Lets you quote this message in your reply. This is useful when you want to reply to an earlier message in a thread but don't have the proper context because of more recent messages. |
| Reaction icon  | Lets you insert a reaction emoji after this message and sets the value to 1. Other viewers can then click the emoji to raise the value by 1. This allows you have other emojis besides the standard "like" icon. For example, if a user found a thread amusing, he could insert a "laughing" face emoji. Other users who agreed could then click on the emoji to raise the value.Â  |
| **Favorite**Â menu option | Lets you add a message as a Favorite. Favorited messages appear in theÂ **Favorited MessagesÂ**section of theÂ **Details**Â pane for this conversation.Â  |
| **Flag for follow-upÂ**menu option | Lets you flag this message for follow-up. When you do this, the message appears in theÂ **Flag for Follow-upÂ**pane so you can easily find it later and take the necessary action. A blue flag icon also appears next to the message in the original conversation so you know it has been flagged.Â  |
| **Create thread**Â menu option | Lets you create a threadÂ within this conversation using this message as the starting point. |
| **Create task**Â menu option | Lets you create and assign a task based on this message. For more information, see [Creating and assigning a task in Buzz](..\creating_and_assigning_project_tasks\index.html "Creating and Assigning Project Tasks"). |
| **Edit**Â menu option | Lets you edit a message you have already posted. When you edit a message, the word "Edited" appears next to it to indicate that it has been modified. |
| **DeleteÂ**menu option | Deletes this message. When you delete a message, it is replaced by the text "This message has been deleted" so viewers know there is a piece of the conversation missing. This option is only available if you wrote the post to be deleted or you have an "Admin" default security profile or a custom role with the "Edit Conversations and Messages" privilege enabled. |

 |
| @-mentioned user | Indicates a user who has been specifically referenced in this message. |
| Attachment | A thumbnail for an attached file or referenced card.
If the thumbnail is for a file, you can click it to open a larger preview. From there you can [open it in the reading view](..\previewing_a_document\index.html "Downloading a Document from Domo"). You can hide file attachments by clicking the **Hide** option next to the filename.
If the thumbnail is for a referenced card, you can click it to show a preview of the card. From there you can open its Details view, add it to a card page, or [add it as a Favorite](..\adding_cards_as_favorites\index.html "Adding Cards as Favorites"). You cannot hide cards as you can file attachments. |
| Thread | Indicates a break-off thread within this conversation. You can create a thread from a message by mousing over the message, clicking the ellipsis, and clickingÂ . In the main conversation view, only the most recent message in a thread is shown, but you can click **View Thread** to open it in its own view, in which all messages in the thread are shown. From there, you can open the details view for the thread.
You can change a private thread to public by opening the details view for the thread then clicking **Make Public**. You can only do this if you started the thread or you have an "Admin" default security profileÂ or a custom role with the "Edit Conversations and Messages" privilege enabled. For more information about default security roles, seeÂ [Default Security Role Reference](..\default_security_role_reference\index.html "Default Security Role Reference"). For more information about custom roles, seeÂ Managing Roles.
You can show all threads in a conversation by clicking threads_toggle_2018.pngÂ at the top of the conversation pane. This opens a pane that shows entries for all threads in the conversation. You can then click an entry to open the thread in its entirety. |
| New message field | Lets you enter a new message in this conversation. You can add attachments to the message by clicking theÂ buzz_add_attachment.pngÂ icon or emojis by clicking theÂ buzz_emoji.pngÂ icon. You can also reference users, groups, cards, pages, or projects within your message by inserting @ then entering the name of the item you want to reference.
You can also start a side thread from the message by clickingÂ buzz_create_topic_from_message_2018.png. |

| New thread icon
buzz_create_topic_from_message_2018.png | Lets you start a side thread in the conversation with this message as the initial message in the conversation. Threads can be set to private (default) or public. Private threads can only be viewed by their creators and anyone @-mentioned in the message or invited in the conversation details view. Public threads are visible to all members of the conversation.Â Â Â  |
| Emoji icon
buzz_emoji.png | Lets you add an emoji to this conversation. |


Details Pane
------------


In the details pane for a conversation you can view and edit details for the conversation such as the name, description, attachments, invited users, and so on.Â The following screenshot points out the main components of this pane:


![buzz_details_pane_2018.png](buzz_details_pane_2018.png)


You can learn more about these components in the following table:


Â 


Â 


| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Details section | Shows basic information about this conversation, including the title, description, and start date. The options that appear here differ depending on whether you are in the details view for a main conversation or a thread as well as the privacy status. For example, the **Make Public** option is only available for private threads.
You can change the title of a people-centered conversation (which takes as its title the names of its primary participants) by clicking and editing. You *cannot* change the name of aÂ  data-centered conversation (i.e. a conversation around a card, page, or project) here. The only way to change the name of a data-centered conversation is to change the name of its element. For example, to change the name of a page conversation, you would need to change the name of the page. |
| Shareable URL link | Generates a URL you can then copy and send to other users. Those users can then follow this URL to open this conversation in Buzz. |
| Add as Favorite/Unfavorite link | Lets you add this conversation to or remove it from yourÂ **Favorites**Â list in the navigation pane.Â  |
| Follow/UnfollowÂ link | Lets you follow or unfollow this conversation. If you follow a conversation, it is considered active and appears in your **Conversations**Â menuÂ in the navigation pane If you unfollow a conversation, it is removed from your **Conversations**Â menu. However, you can return to it by searching for it in the navigation pane. |
| Import Email option (not shown) | Lets you import an existing email thread into this Buzz conversation. For more information, seeÂ [Importing an Email Thread into Buzz](..\importing_an_email_thread_into_buzz\index.html "Importing an Email Thread into Buzz"). |
| Make Public option (private threads only) | Makes a thread visible to all members of the channel. Be aware that once you make a thread public, you cannot change it back to private. |
| Delete (private threads only) | Deletes this thread from the conversation. |
| Notification Settings | Lets you configure Notification Settings for this conversation. You can configure whether notifications are sent viaÂ emailÂ ,Â Domo MobileÂ , SMS , or push notifications on your computerÂ . For each of these, you can indicate whether notifications are sent when you are @ mentioned in the conversation, when any activity occurs in the conversation, or not at all. All of these settings inherit from the global Notification Settings for your Domo. For more information, seeÂ [Configuring Notification and Alert Settings](..\configuring_notification_and_alert_settings\index.html "Configuring Notification and Alert Settings"). |
| Attachments section | Lists all files that have been attached to this conversation. Click a file to open a preview of it as well as download it to your computer.Â  |
| Bots section | Lets you add "Bots"â€”integrations with various third-party connectorsâ€”to your Buzz. For more information, see [Adding a Bot to Buzz](..\adding_a_bot_to_buzz\index.html "Adding a Bot to Buzz").Â  |
| Favorited messagesÂ  | Displays all messages you have added as favorites by clicking theÂ icon. |
| Related conversations (not shown) | Displays conversations with related content.Â  |
| Invite button | Lets you invite users to a conversation. Users invited to a conversation receive notifications for the conversation even if they are not yet following it.Â  |
