New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Week Display control


In charts in which a weekly date grain has been set, the default week display format now includes a date instead of a week number. For example, the tenth week ofÂ 2012 would now display as "03-04-2012" instead of "Week 10."Â Domo administrators who want to revert back to the old format can do so **Admin Settings > Company Settings.**Â This is a global setting that affects all charts in a Domo instance; it cannot be turned on for individual users.

#### Mobile Web Home


The "Home" page is now available in Mobile Web. This page includes trending cards, recently shared cards, new people, favorited cards, and more. The Home page experience is consistent across all platforms.Â   
Â 


DesignÂ Studio updates
The following enhancements have been made to the Design Studio:
Notifications for users with older versions. Creative Cloud syncs version updates to users, so if users have turned off the Creative Cloud desktop sync application or if they need IT permission to upgrade, their version of Design Studio may be out of date. To accommodate this problem, a notification system has been built to identify users with older versions and instruct them on how to upgrade.Â
New font selection interface. The former interface required users to type the font name into a text field. This has now been changed to a drop-down menu that populates with supported web fonts.

Table Widget V2. The new table widget allows you to add sorts;Â define width by pixels or points;Â have alternating row colors;Â and set background transparency, cell borders, and border size.
