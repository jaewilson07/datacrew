Intro
-----


Cake is performance marketing software that provides real-time tracking, attribution, and optimization for marketing professionals. To learn more about the Cake API, visit their page ([https://support.getcake.com/support/...ons/5000109264](https://support.getcake.com/support/solutions/5000109264 "https://support.getcake.com/support/solutions/5000109264")).


You connect to your Cake account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Cake connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Cake account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* Your Cake domain name. This is the portion of your Cake URL immediately following https://. For example, if your URL was <https://mycompany.cake.com>, the domain would be mycompany.
* Your Cake API key. For information about finding your API key, visit this page:Â [https://support.getcake.com/support/...ersion-tracker](https://support.getcake.com/support/solutions/articles/5000576515-your-api-key-and-latest-version-tracker "https://support.getcake.com/support/solutions/articles/5000576515-your-api-key-and-latest-version-tracker")


Connecting to Your Cake Account
-------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Cake Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane

For information about obtaining these credentials, see "Prerequisites," above.


Once you have entered valid Cake credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Cake DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
