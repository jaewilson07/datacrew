Intro
-----


You can be notified when certain events occur in Domo. You can receive Notifications via email or text. These event occurrences include the following:



* A Buzz message is posted to a conversation you are a member of.  
For more information, see [Chatting in Buzz](..\chatting_in_buzz\index.html "Chatting in Buzz").
* You are mentioned in a Buzz discussion using @ (in which case you become a part of the discussion and continue receiving Notifications for comments in that discussion unless you unfollow the discussion).
* An Alert you have created is triggered. For more information, see [Creating a Custom Alert for a Visualization Card](..\creating_an_alert_for_a_visualization_card\index.html "Creating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card").
* A Domo Daily Alert Summary message is sent to you.
* An issue is reported in a card that you own or that you are following. For more information, seeÂ [Reporting Issues with Cards](..\reporting_issues_with_cards\index.html "Reporting Issues with Cards").
* Someone "likes" a discussion you started or a comment you made in Buzz.Â


In addition, you can view all of your Notifications by clicking your user profile photo in the top right corner of the screen.


Configuring Notifications
-------------------------


You can specify how you receive Notifications for certain events in the Notifications Center. For more information, seeÂ [Configuring Notification and Alert Settings](..\configuring_notification_and_alert_settings\index.html "Configuring Notification and Alert Settings").

Unfollowing conversations

You can stop receiving Notifications for conversations you are a member of by unfollowing those conversations in Buzz. This is discussed in more detail in [Unfollowing a Buzz Conversation](..\unfollowing_a_buzz_conversation\index.html "Unfollowing a Buzz Conversation").
