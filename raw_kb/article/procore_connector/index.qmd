Intro
-----


Procore allows large teams of construction companies, property owners, project managers, contractors, and partners to collaborate on large-scale construction projects and share access to documents, planning systems and data. To learn more about the Procore API, visit their page ([https://www.procore.com/platform/procore-connect.php](https://www.procore.com/platform/procore-connect.php "https://www.procore.com/platform/procore-connect.php")).


You connect to your Procore account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Procore connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Procore account and create a DataSet, you must the email address you use to log into Procore, along with your Procore password.


Connecting to Your Procore Account
----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in theÂ **Credentials**Â andÂ **Details**Â panes in the Procore Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page,Â **SchedulingÂ**andÂ **Name & Describe Your DataSet,** are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


### Credentials Pane


The Domo Procore connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. ClickÂ **Connect**Â (or selectÂ **Add Account**Â ifÂ you haveÂ existing Procore accounts in Domo) to open the Procore OAuth screen where you can enter your Procore email address and password. Once you have entered valid Procore credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Procore DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in theÂ **Accounts**Â tab in theÂ Data Center. For more information about this tab, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
