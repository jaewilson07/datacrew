Intro
-----


Greenhouse Software provides a recruiting software as a service that lets companies create a uniform interview procedure so candidates can be judged based on the same rubric. To learn more about the Greenhouse API, visit their page ([https://www.greenhouse.io/features/use-powerful-apis](https://www.greenhouse.io/features/use-powerful-apis "https://www.greenhouse.io/features/use-powerful-apis")).


You connect to your Greenhouse account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Greenhouse connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Greenhouse account and create a DataSet, you must have a Greenhouse API token. This token is provided by Greenhouse. If you do not have an API token, contact your Greenhouse customer service rep.


Connecting to Your Greenhouse Account
-------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in theÂ  **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Greenhouse Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Greenhouse account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API Token | Enter your Greenhouse API token. This token is provided by Greenhouse. If you do not have an API token, contact your Greenhouse customer service rep. |


Once you have entered a valid Greenhouse API token, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Greenhouse DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
