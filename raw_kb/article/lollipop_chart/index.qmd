Intro
-----


Lollipop charts are essentially modified bar charts in which the bars are represented as thin lines so you can fit more in a small area, with small circles to represent mouse-over points. There are eight types of lollipop charts in Domo, all of them modified versions of familiar bar and line bar charts.


For thumbnail images and descriptions of all lollipop charts, see [Available lollipop charts](..\available_lollipop_charts\index.html "Available Lollipop Graphs").


Powering lollipop charts
------------------------


All lollipop charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”one for categories, one for values, and one for series data. Beyond this, the steps for configuring these charts differ depending on the specific lollipop chart type. Each chart type has an equivalent Bar- or Line Bar-type chart. You can find out more about a specific lollipop chart type by navigating to the topic for the equivalent Bar or Line Bar chart in the following table:




| Lollipop chart Type | Equivalent Bar or Line Bar chart Type |
| --- | --- |
| Vertical grouped lollipop | [Vertical grouped bar](..\grouped_bar_chart\index.html "Grouped Bar Graph") |
| Vertical stacked lollipop | [Vertical stacked bar](..\stacked_bar_chart\index.html "Stacked Bar Graph") |
| Vertical grouped lollipop with line | [Vertical grouped bar with line](..\grouped_bar_with_line_chart\index.html "Grouped Bar with Line Graph") |
| Vertical stacked lollipop with line | [Vertical stacked bar with line](..\stacked_bar_with_line_chart\index.html "Stacked Bar with Line Graph") |
