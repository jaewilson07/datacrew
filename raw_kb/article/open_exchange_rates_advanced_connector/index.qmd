Intro
-----


Open Exchange Rates provides real-time exchange rates and currency conversion data. Use Domoâ€™sÂ Open Exchange Rates Advanced connector to retrieve theÂ latest exchange rates, historical data for a given day or date range, or a list of world currencies.Â To learn more about the Open Exchange RatesÂ API, visit theirÂ website (<https://docs.openexchangerates.org/>).


There is also a simplified version of this connector that allows you to see exchange rates for a base world currency. To learn more about this connector, see [Open Exchange Rates Connector](..\open_exchange_rates_connector\index.html "Open Exchange Rates Connector").

The Open Exchange Rates Advanced connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking **Cloud App** in the toolbar at the top of the window.Â 


You connect toÂ Open Exchange Rates in theÂ Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Open Exchange Rates Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Best Practices
--------------


The "Currencies" report only returns countries and their associated currency symbols. To pull the conversation rate, you'll need to use the "Latest" or "Time Series Queries" report then join it back to the "Currencies" report using theÂ **Currency Symbol**Â field.Â 


Prerequisites
-------------


None.


Connecting toÂ Open Exchange Rates
----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Details**Â pane in the Open Exchange Rates Advanced Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page,Â **Scheduling**Â andÂ **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Report**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | SelectÂ an Open Exchange Rates Advanced report. The following reports are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Currencies | Returns a list of world currencies. |
| Historical Data | Returns exchange rates for a specific date. |
| Latest | Returns a list of the latest exchange rates. |
| Time Series Queries | Returns exchange rates for a range of dates. Â  |

 |
| Base Currency | Enter the three-letter abbreviation for the desired base currency. If you do not enter a base currency, USD will be used by default. |
| Specific Currencies | Enter a comma-separated list of three-letter currency abbreviationsÂ to request the exchange rates for those currencies. For example: EGP,CNY,GEL to return the exchange rates forÂ Egyptian pounds, Chinese yuan, and Georgian lari. Â Â  |
| Date | Enter a date inÂ yyyy-mm-dd format to retrieve exchange rates for that date. For example:Â 2014-08-28Â  |
| Start Days | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with End Days to create a range of represented days. For example, if you entered 10Â for Start Days and 5 for End Days, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago.Â Enter 0 for today. |
| End Days | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with Start Days to create a range of represented days. For example, if you entered 10Â for Start Days and 5 for End Days, the report would contain data for 10 days ago up until 5 days ago. Enter 0 for today. |
