Intro
-----


The AppNexus Log-Level data service (formerly known as the Data Siphon Service) allows users to retrieve and track feeds of log-level event data that include dimensions not available in the AppNexus Console or via the APIÂ Report Service.Â  To learn more about the AppNexus Log-Level API, visit their page (<https://wiki.appnexus.com/display/api/>).


You connect to your AppNexus Log-Level account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the AppNexus Log-Level connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your AppNexus Log-Level account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password you use to log into [console.appnexus.com](http://console.appnexus.com).Â 


Connecting to Your AppNexus Log-Level Account
---------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the AppNexus Log-Level Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your AppNexus Log-Level account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | EnterÂ the username you use to log into [console.appnexus.com](http://console.appnexus.com).Â  |
| Password | Enter the password you use to log into [console.appnexus.com](http://console.appnexus.com).Â  |


Once you have entered valid AppNexus Log-Level credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new AppNexus Log-Level DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus for configuring your report.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Select the AppNexus Log-Level report you want to run.Â Currently only a single report type is available.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Feeds Report | Returns a feedÂ of log-level event data that include dimensions not available in the AppNexus Console or via the API. |

 |
| Siphon Name | Select the siphon you want to retrieve data for. |
| Duration | Select the duration type for the report. If you selectÂ **Single Date and Hour**, you are asked to select the specific date and hour for the log data you want to see. If you selectÂ **Since Last Successful Run**, the report pulls in all new data since the report was last successfully run. |
| Date | Select the date you want to pull log data for. This date should be within the last 10 days. |
| Hour | Select the hour of the selected date you want to pull log data for. |


### Other Panes
