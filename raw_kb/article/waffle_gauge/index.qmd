Intro
-----


Gauges are simple charts that indicate progress towards meeting a target. Waffle charts provide a new, simple and intuitive way to visualize data as it includes many customizable settings to tell a more informative story. Other gauge types in Domo include [single value gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Single+Value+gauge "Single Value Gauge"), [radial gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Radial+gauge "Radial Gauge"), [face gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Face+gauge "Face Gauge"), and [comparative fill gauges](http://wiki.domo.com/confluence/display/DHCS/Building+a+Comparative+Fill+gauge "Comparative Fill Gauge").


Powering Waffle Gauges
----------------------


A Waffle Gauge requires only one column or row of data from your DataSetâ€”the Gauge Value that contains current values. The other option is an Optional Max Value that you intend for your data to achieve.Â For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


If multiple rows are present in your DataSet, the values in all of the rows are aggregated. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the target value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for "Team A" that both had a target value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new target value of 200. Selecting **No Aggregation** for either the current value or maximum does *not* currently work.


Unless you add a column to the Optional Max Value, the maximum value of a Waffle Gauge is automatically determined based on the current value. For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200.


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Waffle Gauge. For more information about choosing data columns, see [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see [Analyzer Overview](..\analyzer_overview\index.md).


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Waffle Gauge:

Customizing Waffle Gauges
