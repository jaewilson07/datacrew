Intro
-----


A Tree Map displays the names of categories within rectangles of differing sizes. The sizes of the rectangles reflect the relative values of each category.


Powering Tree Maps
------------------


Tree Maps require two data columns or rows from your data source. One of these contains category data, and the other contains the values for each category. You may also add optional series data (up to six additional categories) to create a Nested Tree Map. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data"). A value column can also be used to determine the color values used in the chart.


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Tree Map. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


The following graphic shows you how data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Tree Map:

Customizing Tree Maps
---------------------


You can customize the appearance of a Tree Map by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties"). Unique properties of Tree Maps include the following:




| Property | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General > Maximum Items Before 'Other' | Determines the number of rectangles in the Tree Map that are represented as uniqueâ€”all remaining rectangles in the chart are aggregated into an "Other" rectangle. | tree_map_other.png |
| General > Percent Value Decimal Places | Determines the number of decimal places in values. | â€” |
| Label Settings > Position | Determines the position of labels. | â€” |
| Label Settings > Text | Specifies text to replace the default text in Tree Maps. The example at right shows a Tree Map in which the user has implemented a macro to show the value for each state. For more information about creating data label text, including a list of available macros, seeÂ [Formatting Data Label and Hover Text in Your Chart](..\formatting_data_label_and_hover_text_in_your_chart\index.html "Formatting Data Label and Hover Text in Your Chart"). | tree_map_macros.png |
