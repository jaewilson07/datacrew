Intro
-----


You can format the size of bars in bar charts using various options inÂ **Chart Properties**, including the following:



* Changing the percentage of space taken up by each bar
* Specifying how bars appear in charts with only one bar


Changing bar width or height percentage
---------------------------------------


In a bar chart, each bar takes up a set amount of space. By default, a bar takes up about 90% of its given space. By changing theÂ **Width Percentage**Â orÂ **Height Percentage**Â for a vertical or horizontal bar chart, respectively, you can change the percentage of space taken up by each bar. Possible values range from 0 (at which bars appear as lines) to 100 (at which bars touch other bars).


The following example shows a vertical bar chart with aÂ **Width Percentage**Â ofÂ 20.

The following example shows the same chart with aÂ **Width Percentage**Â ofÂ 100.

**To change the percentage of space taken up by bars in a chart,**


1. Open the AnalyzerÂ for the chart you want to edit.
2. In **Chart Properties**, click **Bar Settings**.
3. Enter the desired percentage value in theÂ **Width Percentage**Â field (for a chart with vertical bars) orÂ **Height Percentage**Â field (for a chart with horizontal bars).
