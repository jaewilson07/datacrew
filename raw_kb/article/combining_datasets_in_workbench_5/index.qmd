You can combine DataSets in Workbench 5Â by writing SQL queries (ODBC and OLAP DataSets only)Â or using Lookup Tables to create joins (all DataSet types).Â This topic focuses on using Lookup Tables. For more information about writing SQL queries for ODBC and OLAP DataSets, see [Connecting to an OLAP cube](..\connecting_to_an_olap_cube_in_workbench_5\index.html "Creating a Job for Uploading Data Using Workbench 4").


In Workbench 5,Â a "Lookup Table" is a DataSet you combine with a primary DataSet.Â The Lookup Table *must* be saved as a DataSet job in Workbench or the join will not work. The Lookup Table DataSet and primary DataSet must both contain one column with unique matching values ("key columns"); that is, the values in both columns must be the same, but there cannot be duplicate values in eitherÂ column. In addition, the names of the matching columnsÂ must be different.Â (You can changeÂ column names in Workbench if need be.) Once you match key columns, a new DataSet is created by joining all columns from both DataSets. Combining DataSetsÂ in this wayÂ is equivalent to using a LEFT JOIN in SQL.


**To combine DataSetsÂ using Lookup Tables,**


1. In Workbench, click ![wb5_jobs_icon.png](wb5_jobs_icon.png)Â in the left-hand icon bar.
2. In the Jobs listing, double-clickÂ the job with your primary data source (i.e. the data source you intend to combine with another data source).
3. Click **Transforms**Â to expand that section of the pane.
4. In theÂ **Add a transform**Â menu, selectÂ **Lookup Table Transform**.
5. Click theÂ ![wb5_add_transform_icon.png](wb5_add_transform_icon.png)Â button.  
TheÂ **Lookup Table Transform Editor**Â appears.
6. Â In the **Lookup Source DataSet** menu, select theÂ DataSet you intend toÂ combine withÂ your primary DataSet.  
The DataSet you selectÂ *must* be saved as a DataSet job in Workbench.Â   
  
If you have not yet uploaded the selected job to Domo, you are now asked if you want to do so.
7. In the **Lookup Source Key** menu, select the column from the Lookup Source you intend to match with a column in your primary DataSet.
8. In the **Primary Key** menu, select the matching column.
9. (Optional) If you want Workbench to generate an error if your Lookup Source is found to be missing, turn on **Error on Missing Lookup**.

Â 


**Note:Â**If any columns in your Lookup Table have the same name as columns in your primary table, you must change those names. You can do this by opening theÂ **Schema**Â subtab for the DataSet job then making changes as necessary underÂ **Destination Column**.Â If necessary, you can also remove columnsÂ by clearing the checkboxes for those columns under **Include**.
Â
10. ClickÂ **Apply**.
11. ClickÂ ![wb5_save_icon.png](wb5_save_icon.png)Â at the top of the pane to save your transform.


The next time you run the job, the lookup source DataSet will be added to the primary DataSet in Domo.
