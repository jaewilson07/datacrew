Intro
-----


SilverpopÂ is a cloud-based marketing automation provider that offers email marketing and lead management. To learn more about the Silverpop API, visit their page ([https://www.programmableweb.com/api/silverpop](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/silverpop "https://www.programmableweb.com/api/silverpop")).  


You connect to your Silverpop account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Silverpop connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Silverpop account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* Your Silverpop Engage pod number (i.e. the number of the "Engage" instance you created the application in)Â
* Your Silverpop client ID
* Your Silverpop client secret
* Your Silverpop refresh token (which you should have received via email from Silverpop)
* An FTP username and password (only required if you plan to run "Export" reports to download reports from the Silverpop file server)Â Â


Connecting to Your Silverpop Account
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Silverpop Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Silverpop account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Silverpop Engage Pod Number | Enter your Silverpop Engage pod number, which is the number of the "Engage" instance you created your application in. |
| Client ID | Enter your Silverpop client ID. |
| Client Secret | Enter your Silverpop client secret. |

Once you have entered valid Silverpop credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Silverpop DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
