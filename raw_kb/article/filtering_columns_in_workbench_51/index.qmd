You can use theÂ **Filter** transform to apply filters to a selected column. You canÂ choose to have Workbench return matches or non-matches for the specified filter query. You can also include or exclude blank cells in yourÂ filtered data.Â

You can use regular expressions in building filter queries, just as you can when using theÂ **Search & ReplaceÂ**filter. Currently no Regular Expression Builder is available for helping you build filters as it is withÂ **Search & Replace**; however, you can use all of the same constructions when building filter queries. For more information about theÂ **Search & Replace**Â Regular Expression Builder, see [Replacing a Column Value in Workbench 5.1](..\replacing_a_column_value_in_workbench_51\index.md).


**To filter data in Workbench 5.1,**


1. In Workbench, click ![wb5_jobs_icon.png](wb5_jobs_icon.png)Â in the left-hand icon bar.
2. In the Jobs listing, double-clickÂ the DataSet job with columns you want to filter.
3. Click **Transforms**Â to expand that section of the pane.
4. In theÂ **Add a transform**Â menu, selectÂ **Filter Transform**.
5. Click the ![wb5_add_transform_icon.png](wb5_add_transform_icon.png)Â button.

6. In theÂ **Search Column** menu, select the column you want to filter.
7. In theÂ **Include Filter** field, enterÂ your filter query.
8. (Conditional) If you want toÂ prevent blank cells from appearing in your filtered column,Â setÂ **Exclude Null** toÂ **On**. Otherwise leave this off.
9. (Conditional)Â If you wantÂ your filter to return non-matches forÂ your query, setÂ **Exclude Matches** toÂ **On**.Â Otherwise leaveÂ this off.
10. Click **Apply**.
11. Click ![wb5_save_icon.png](wb5_save_icon.png)Â at the top of the pane to save your transform.
