You can create new columns in DataSets in Workbench 5 by building calculations based on the data in other columns. For example, youÂ mightÂ have a column containingÂ values with one or more decimal places.Â You could create a new column in whichÂ all of the values in the original column are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number,Â using theÂ CEILING orÂ FLOOR functions, respectively. Workbench 5 contains over 80 such functions you can use in constructing calculations. Categories of functions include logical (such as AND, NOT, IF, etc.), mathematical (such as ACOS, RND, and SUMLIST), statistical (such as AVERAGE, MAX, and STDEV), text (such as CONCATENATE, MID, and SUBSTITUTE), and date and time (such as DAY, EOMONTH, and TODAY). You can find descriptions of all of the functions in the Workbench 4 user interface.


You build calculated fields for a selected DataSet job in the **CalculatedÂ Field Transform Editor.Â**You access the **CalculatedÂ Field Transform Editor**Â for a DataSet by adding a **Calculation** transform.

**To add a calculated field in Workbench 5,**


1. In Workbench, click ![wb5_jobs_icon.png](wb5_jobs_icon.png)Â in the left-hand icon bar.
2. In the Jobs listing, double-clickÂ the job for which you want to create a calculated column.
3. Click **Transforms**Â to expand that section of the pane.
4. In theÂ **Add a transform**Â menu, selectÂ **Calculated Field Transform**.
5. Click theÂ ![wb5_add_transform_icon.png](wb5_add_transform_icon.png)Â button.  
TheÂ **Calculated Field Transform Editor**Â appears.
6. Enter a name for the new column in the **Column Name** field.
7. Build your calculation in theÂ **Calculation** field using the column names in theÂ **Available columns**Â listing and the functions in theÂ **Available**  **functions** listing.  
You can add column names and functions to a calculation by double-clicking them in the list. Â   
You can filter the functions by category by selecting the desired category inÂ theÂ **Category** menu. All functionsÂ are accompanied by descriptions; you can seeÂ the description for a function by clicking that function. In addition, each function shows its proper usage. For example, the SUM function is represented as SUM (p1, [p2],...).Â This means that youÂ are summing the values in all referenced columns, which are indicated by p1, p2, and so on.Â Â
8. ClickÂ **Validate** to ensure thatÂ your calculation is valid.


**Note:Â**In calculations, column names *cannot* contain non-ASCII characters. You can reference a column in a calculation using Column# where # is the 1-based column order. For example: CONCATENATE(Column2,Column3)
9. ClickÂ **Apply**Â when finished.
10. ClickÂ ![wb5_save_icon.png](wb5_save_icon.png)Â at the top of the pane to save your transform.


Â The next time you run the job, the newly calculated column will be added to your DataSet.
