Intro
-----


DoubleClick Search (DS) is a search management platform that helps agencies and marketers efficiently manage some of the largest search marketing campaigns in the world, across multiple engines and media channels. To learn more about the DoubleClick Search API, visit their page (<https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-search/>).  


You connect to your DoubleClick Search account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DoubleClick Search connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your DoubleClick Search account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* A DoubleClickÂ Search client ID
* A DoubleClick Search client secret


You can create a client ID and secret in theÂ [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). To do this, follow these steps:


1. Go to Google API Console atÂ <https://console.developers.google.com>.
2. Click **Credentials** in the left column.
3. In the **Create Credentials**Â menu, select **OAuth Client ID**.
4. (Conditional) If **OAuth Consent** is not set up already, continue to the **Consent** screen. Otherwise, skip to Step 5.
	1. Add an **App Name**, **User Support Email**, and the **Authorized Domain**Â as **[domo.com](http://domo.com)**, everything else can be left blank.
	2. **Save** **and Continue**.
	3. There is no scope required, **Save and Continue**.
	4. There are no test users required, **Save and Continue**.
	5. Click **Credentials** in the left column.
	6. In the **Create Credentials**Â menu, select **OAuth Client ID**.
5. Select **Web application** as the **Application Type**.
6. Enter the desired name for the client (such as "DoubleClick Search Client").
7. For the **Authorized Redirect URL**, enterÂ <https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/doubleclick-search/exchange>.
8. Click **Create**.  
 A box then pops up showing the client ID and secret.


You will also need to make sure access is enabled to theÂ DoubleClick Search API. To do this, follow these steps:


1. Click **Library**Â in the left column.
2. Click theÂ **DoubleClick Search API**Â link.
3. Click theÂ **Enable**Â button found at the top of the screen. (If the button readsÂ **Disable**, the API is already enabled.)Â

Connecting to Your DoubleClick Search Account
---------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the DoubleClick Search Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your DoubleClick Search account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â

For information about obtaining these credentials, see "Prerequisites," above.


Once you have entered valid DoubleClick Search credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new DoubleClick Search DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
