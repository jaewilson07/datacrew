Intro
-----


Sysomos Expion lets users manage content and relationships across social channels at scale by integrating content marketing, social management, and analytics. Use Domo'sÂ Sysomos Expion connector to retrieve ad data, insights, messages, account information, and more.Â To learn more about the Sysomos Expion API, visit their page ([https://sysomos.com/services/api/](https://sysomos.com/services/api/ "https://sysomos.com/services/api/")).


You connect to your Sysomos Expion account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sysomos Expion connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Sysomos Expion account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* The client ID for your Sysomos Expion application
* The client secret for your Sysomos Expion application


If you do not know your credentials, reach out to your Sysomos support representative.


Connecting to Your Sysomos Expion Account
-----------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Sysomos Expion Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Sysomos Expion account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter the client ID for your Sysomos application. |
| Client Secret | Enter the client secret for your Sysomos application. |


Once you have entered valid Sysomos Expion credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Sysomos Expion DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").

For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
