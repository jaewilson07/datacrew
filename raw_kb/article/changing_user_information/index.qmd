You can change information for a user by changing account information in **More >** **Admin > Governance > People**, including the user name, email address, phone number, title, security role, group membership, and content access. You must have an "Admin" [custom role](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Default Security Role Reference") with the "Edit users" privilege enabled to do this.Â 


For information about managing user accounts for connectors, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


**To change information in a user account,**


1. Click **More**Â **> Admin**.  
The Admin SettingsÂ appears.
2. Select the **Governance** tab.  
The **People** sub-tab appears.
3. In the user listing, select the name of the user you want.
4. Hover over the information you want to change for the user.
5. Click the ![Pencil_Edit_Icon.png](Pencil_Edit_Icon.png) icon.
6. Update the information.
7. When finished, click **Save**.


Non-Admin users can also change some (but not all) of this information in their personal Profile pages. For more information, see [Specifying Your Personal Profile Information](..\specifying_your_personal_profile_information\index.html "Specifying Your Personal Profile Information").


Email addresses areÂ *not*Â editable while SSO is enabled. If you have enabled SSO and you want to update any email addresses, you will need to do the following:


1. Navigate toÂ **More**Â **> Admin > Authentication > SAML (SSO)**.
2. Temporarily disable SSO.
3. Navigate to theÂ **Governance >** **People** tab and locate the user whose email address you need to update.
4. Edit the email address to match the address you have in your SSO environment.
5. Reenable SSO in the **Authentication >** **SAML (****SSO)** sub-tab.


Because deactivating SSO can affect users' ability to access the instance, we would suggest doing this outside of normal operating hours.Â
