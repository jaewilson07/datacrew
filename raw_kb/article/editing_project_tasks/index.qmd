In the task details page for a project, you can edit any task by opening the edit dialog for that task and making the changes you want. You can only edit tasks in projects in which you have access, unless you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Tasks and Projects" enabled.Â For more information about default security roles, seeÂ [Managing Custom Roles](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Security Role Reference").


In this dialog you can edit all of the following:



* The task name and description
* The task owner as well as the contributors assigned to the task


**Note****:** Admins are not able to remove the owner of a project.
* The task due date
* The project to which the task belongs
* Task tags


You can also add comments and attachments to the task in this dialog, as well as [archive](..\archiving_project_tasks_and_lists\index.html "Archiving Project Tasks and Lists") the task.

If you attempt to upload a file not within this list, an error message appears. For more information, including a full list of supported file types, see [Permitted File Types for Attachments](..\permitted_file_types_for_attachments\index.html "Permitted File Types for Attachments").
