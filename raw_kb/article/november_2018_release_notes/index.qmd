New Features and EnhancementsÂ
------------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### OpenID Connect (OIDC)


Domo customers can now access Domo through OpenID Connect--an industry standard, lightweight method for Single Sign-On (SSO). Domo already supports the industry leading protocol SAML 2.0 for SSO. The addition of OpenID Connect provides customers with a simpler, lower cost option. OpenID Connect is also better-suited than SAML 2.0 for developers, mobile users, and Domo Embed users.Â   
Â Â   
OpenID Connect can be run in conjunction with SAML, which makes it easy for users to include both internal and external personnel in a single instance. This is particularly useful for companies that already utilize a stable SSO connection for their employeesÂ but want to extend Domo to their suppliers and customers.Â 


OpenID Connect is available now available for all customers.


Â 


For more information, see [Configuring Domo SSO Using OpenID Connect](..\enabling_sso_with_openid_connect\index.html "Configuring Domo SSO Using OpenID Connect").Â 


### Custom Security Roles


Domo has always providedÂ [built-in security roles](..\default_security_role_reference\index.html "Security Role Reference")Â such as "Admin,"Â "Privileged," and "Participant"Â that are used to restrict access to sensitive Domo features. TheseÂ roles govern which users in your Domo instance can perform sensitive tasksÂ such as exporting data, inviting users, and changing company settings. These built-in roles have not always provided the flexibility needed to meet the security needs of larger organizations. Now, with the Role Management tool, you can create and manage custom security roles, giving youÂ moreÂ flexibility and finer granularity in assigning access to Domo's powerful features.


Using Role Management, you can...



* Expand the list of roles beyond the current built-in roles (Admin, Privileged, Editor, Participant, and Social).
* Manage the privileges assigned to each new role.
* Delete unused roles.
* Get easy reporting on the privileges and list of assigned users in each new role.
* Use SSOÂ to automatically assign people to appropriate roles through a SAMLÂ assertion at each login.


You can create as many custom roles as needed for your organization.


Â 


This feature is availableÂ *on demand.Â*To request that this feature be enabled...
