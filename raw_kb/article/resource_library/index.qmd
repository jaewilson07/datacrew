Intro
-----


The Resource Library lets you quickly access additional information to answer your Domo questions. It also stores all of the pop-up guides and walkthroughs of new features so that you can review them again once you have closed the window.


To access the Resource Library, click the ![Question_Mark_Icon.png](Question_Mark_Icon.png) icon in the bottom corner of your screen. The Resource Library consists of three parts:



* [Guides and walkthroughs](#h_01FGM68Y7NCTDG0PDT2B4WQAGJ)
* [Resources](#h_01FGM69843PZDVDRYCP0M67AQT)
* [Product announcements](#h_01FGM69DBFAW8AERN82V0Z3J4B)

Guides and walkthroughs
-----------------------


The Guides and walkthroughs section contains all of the information in the pop-up windows when you first log into Domo. These can now be re-triggered to go over the information again.


Â
**Note:** The list will only display features that are relevant to the current Page you are on. For example, if a Guide is for something in the Data Center, you will need to be on the Data Center Page for the Guide to display in the list.
