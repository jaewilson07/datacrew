New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Alert Enhancements


#### New Alerting Options


Domo now includes a number of new alert configuration options that give youÂ the ability to provide more actionable context around alerts. These new optionsÂ bring a whole new experience to Alerts and help you toÂ trust your alerts more than ever before. These new options include the following:



* You can schedule when you want an alert to evaluate so nothing is missed. If you don't want your alert evaluating over the weekends, or after business hours, you can adjust it.
* You can choose whether to continue to receive notifications for triggered alerts based on the alert evaluation schedule you have set. For example, if you selectedÂ **Hourly**Â for your evaluation schedule, once the alert triggered a notification would be sent once every hour until the triggered state ended or you deactivated the alert.
* New time-based ("current value") alerts help you to set measurable goals and then be alerted when the progress you expect is not taking place.

For more information, see [Creating an Alert for a Visualization Card](..\creating_an_alert_for_a_visualization_card\index.md).


#### Alert Sharing


Get the right alerts into the hands of the right people using the new Alert Sharing feature.Â You can now share alerts with other users in your Domo so they receive notifications every time that alert triggers. You can also share alerts in Buzz conversations, in which case all users following the conversation receive notifications.Â Alert sharing allows you to create business alignment by providing shared understanding on critical data conditions.


By popular demand, we also support the ability to share an alert with a group. It is now even easier to align your team on the most critical business conditions. No longer do you need to addÂ each of your team members individually.

#### Mobile Alerts


We now provide native alert support for the iOS and Android applications. Alerts enable you to set custom thresholds to be notified when your business KPIs hit a defined limit. This enables you to run your business even more seamlessly. In addition to the power of alerts, Domo users can now receive push notifications for any subscribed triggered alert and be taken right to the card within their native apps. In the card, you can find detailed information about the alert so you can dig in to fully understand the reason for the alert. Available in the iOS and Android app updates.

### Chart Updates


The following additions and updates have been made to the visualization experience in Domo:



* A new chart type, 100% Stacked Bar with Line, is now available.  
   
 ![](4.png)  
   
 For more information, see [100% Stacked Bar with Line Graph](..\100_percent_stacked_bar_with_line_chart\index.html "100% Stacked Bar with Line Graph").
* Two new country maps have been added:



	+ The Philippines. For more information, see [Country Map](..\country_map\index.html "Country Map").
	+ Post-2015 France. This map includes updated regional divisions as per the changes that went into effect on January 1, 2016. The legacy version of the map will continue to be available. For more information, see [Country Map](..\country_map\index.html "Country Map").
* Another new map, U.S. State, lets you show county-levelÂ data for specific states. All you need to power a U.S. State chart is a column with FIPSÂ (county) data and your value column.


  
 ![](5.png)  
   
 For more information, see [U.S. County Map](..\us_state_and_county_maps\index.html "U.S. County Map").
* You now have the ability to set line or range scale markers dynamically based on a percentile, percentage, or standard deviation. You can also include scale markers based on quantiles (shown in the following example).  
   
 ![](6.png)  
   
 For more information about these properties, seeÂ [Adding Scale MarkersÂ to Your Chart](..\adding_scale_markers_to_your_charts\index.html "Adding a Scale Marker Range to Your Chart").
* Various new properties have been implemented for customizing legends, hover legends, and data labels in pie-type graphs. For more information, see [Properties for Pie-Type Charts](..\properties_for_pietype_charts\index.html "Properties for Pie-Type Charts").
* You can now set custom sizing on table cards in the card view when the "Full Size" option is selectedâ€”anywhere from 1 to 6 card sizes in both width and height.  
   
 ![](7.png)Â   
   
 For more information, seeÂ [Changing the Size of Cards in a Page](..\changing_the_size_of_cards_on_a_dashboard\index.html "Changing the Size of Cards in a Page").
* You can access table formatting and total/subtotal options from the column dropdownsÂ above your table preview, allowing you to make quick customizations to specific columns in your table.  
 Â


### Duplicate Page


DomoÂ now provides aÂ **Save As**Â option for pages, which allows you to copy all content, collections, layouts, card sizes, and filters. This results in a new page with all content and settings duplicated.Â 


Using this option, you can duplicate a page with all of the following elements copied:



* Cards
* Card sizes
* Filters built into cards using Analyzer
* Collections
* Page-level filters


This option doesÂ *not*Â copy the following elements from pages:



* Sub-pages
* Temporary filters created at the card Details level
* Alerts on cards
* Scheduled reports
* Users the original page was being shared with


You can access this option by selectingÂ **Save As**Â in the wrench menu for the page. You then enter the desired name for the new page, indicate whether you want to open the new page after you save, then save the changes.

For more information, see [Duplicating Pages](..\duplicating_dashboards_save_as\index.html "Duplicating Pages").


### Bulk Add Users


YouÂ can now easily add teams, departments, and organizations to your Domo instance in a single action. The new "Bulk Add" feature enables you to provide a list of people you want to add to yourÂ Domo instance. The file just needs to be in CSVÂ format and include, at a minimum, a list of email addresses and display names.Â 


All you need to do to import your list of users is go intoÂ **Admin > People > Bulk Add**Â and follow the instructions. You can even download a sample CSV file that shows you how your list should be formatted. The days of adding users to Domo one by one are over!
