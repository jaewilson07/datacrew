Intro
-----


Ivinex is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) all-in-one platform that tracks sales, service, marketing, and call center data.Â  To learn more about the Ivinex API, visit their page ([http://training.ivinex.com/ivinex-api-documentation/](http://training.ivinex.com/ivinex-api-documentation/ "http://training.ivinex.com/ivinex-api-documentation/")).


You connect to your Ivinex account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Ivinex connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Ivinex account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* Your IvinexÂ company URL.
* Your IvinexÂ username and password.


Connecting to Your Ivinex Account
---------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Ivinex Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Ivinex account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Company | Enter the URL for your company Ivinex instance. |
| Username | Enter your IvinexÂ username. |
| Password | Enter your Ivinex password. |


Once you have entered valid Ivinex credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Ivinex DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
