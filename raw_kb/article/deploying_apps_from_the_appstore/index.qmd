In the Appstore, you can deploy an app to your Domo instance. If any installations of the app have already been deployed to your company Domo instance, you are given the option of requesting access to an existing version or deploying a new version of your own. Â Â 


When you deploy an app, Domo first installs the Cards with sample data. Cards with sample data appear with a label reading **Demo** **Data** to indicate they are not yet live.

You can then take your time in looking over the Cards to make sure this app is what you need. When you are ready, you can power up the Cards in the app with live data by connecting to a third-party Connector account (for Dashboard apps) or DataSet with matching columns (for all other kinds of apps), or you can assign another user to power it up.

Â Â Â 


**ToÂ deploy an app to Domo,**


1. Click **Appstore**.
2. Identify the app you want to add.  
You can use the various filter and sorting options to locate the desired app. For more information, see [Appstore Layout](..\_appstore_layout\index.html "Appstore Layout").
3. Click the app to open its Details view.
4. In the Details view, review the requirements and notes for theÂ app.
5. Click **Try It**.

Â 


**Note:Â**Users with a "Participant" default security roleÂ (or users with a custom role that does not include the "Use Appstore" grant) do not see theÂ **Try It**Â button, as they are not able to deploy Appstore apps. Instead, they will see aÂ **Request**Â button. Clicking this button opens a dialog in which the user can reach out to his/her MajorDomoÂ and request that the app be installed. For more information about default security roles, seeÂ [Managing Custom Roles](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Security Role Reference").
6. (Conditional) If any versions of this app have already been installed, you are given the option of requesting access to an existing version or adding a new version. For information about requesting access to an existing version, see [Requesting Access to an app](..\requesting_access_to_an_app\index.html "Requesting Access to an App"); otherwise click **Add New** then proceed to the next step.
7. Give your app a unique name, then click **Save & Finish**.  
A new Domo page is added for the app. All Cards for the app are installed with sample data and appear with a blue bar at the top with text reading "Example" to indicate that they are not yet live. You are also given the option to power up this app yourself or assign it to a data specialist.Â
8. Review the app(s) in the page to make sureÂ these are the metrics you want to show.
9. Do one of the following:



	* To assign the powering of this app to another user...
	
	
		1. Click **Assign to Data Specialist**.  
		  
		![appstore_deploy_assign.png](appstore_deploy_assign.png)  
		  
		The **Assign to data ownerÂ**dialog appears, with fields for selecting a data specialist and entering a custom message.Â   
		  
		![appstore_deploy_assign_dialog.png](appstore_deploy_assign_dialog.png)
		2. In theÂ **Select data specialist**Â field, enter the name of the user you want to assign to power this app.Â
		3. (Optional) Enter an email message to be sent to the data specialistÂ if you want.
		4. Click **Send**.  
		The user you have assigned will receive an email notificationÂ informing him or her about the assignment.
	* Â To power up the app yourself...
	
	
		1. ClickÂ **Do It Yourself**.  
		  
		![appstore_deploy_diy.png](appstore_deploy_diy.png)  
		  
		The blue bar updates to show **Connect** buttons for all DataSets powering the app, along with the total number of DataSets and Cards associated with this app. For example, the app in the following screenshot is powered off of 2 DataSets and contains 11 Cards, and both DataSets have **Connect**Â buttons so you can power them up individually.  
		  
		![appstore_deploy_connect.png](appstore_deploy_connect.png)
		2. Click **Connect**.  
		  
		What happens next depends on the type of app you are deploying. If the app is a *Dashboard app*, to power a Card you will be asked to connect to one of Domo's third-party connectors, usually by entering credentials and/or other information.  
		  
		![appstore_deploy_creds.png](appstore_deploy_creds.png)  
		  
		If the app is a *Card Builder app* or *custom app*, you will be asked to select an existing DataSet in Domo with column names matching those in the app.  
		  
		![appstore_deploy_cardbuilder.png](appstore_deploy_cardbuilder.png)
		3. (Conditional) If you are deploying a Dashboard app, follow the steps in the wizard for connecting to data.Â   
		  
		The specific steps in the wizard differ depending on the Connector. In most cases you are asked to select a Connector account, or to add a new account ifÂ one doesn't exist yet. For some connectors (such as NOAA) you are asked to enter other information, such as your zip code. You can also assign another user to power the app if you want.Â
		4. (Conditional) If you are deploying a Card Builder or custom app...
		
		
			1. In pane 1,Â select the DataSet you want to use to power up the app.
			2. Drag and drop DataSetÂ columns from pane 1 onto the matching columns in pane 2.Â   
			  
			If the data type matches for the two columns, a blue outline will appear around the column in pane 2 when you drag the column on top of it.  
			  
			![appstore_deploy_drag.png](appstore_deploy_drag.png)  
			  
			If the data type does not match, no outline appears. If you attempt to drop a column onto a non-matching column anyway, no match occurs.
			3. Once you have matched all columns in pane 2, click the orange **Connect** button.  
			  
			The Cards in the app now populate with live data from your DataSet.Â   
			  
			You can go in and update the DataSet and/or columns populating the Cards in this app anytime by opening the app, selecting **Do It Yourself**, clickingÂ **Change**, then making the desired changes.
