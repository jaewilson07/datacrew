In theÂ **People** sub-tab of the Admin Settings, you can generate a CSV file with rows for all of the users in your Domo instance. Each row shows the following information:

* **roleID**. A number corresponding to the user's selected security role in theÂ **Roles** menu in **More >** **Admin > Governance > People**. (For more information about default security roles, see [Default Security Role Reference](..\default_security_role_reference\index.html "Default Security Role Reference")). Numbers and their corresponding roles are as follows:



	+ 1 = Admin
	+ 2 = Privileged
	+ 3 = Editor
	+ 4 = Participant
	+ 5 = Social
* **title**. The user's title as entered into theÂ **Title** field in **More > Admin > GovernanceÂ > People**.
* **department**. The user's department as entered into theÂ **Department**Â field in the Profile page.

You can generate a user CSV by clicking theÂ **Bulk ExportÂ**orÂ ![bulk_export_download_button.png](bulk_export_download_button.png) button in **More > Admin > GovernanceÂ > People**. TheÂ **Bulk Export**Â option generates a new file. If you clickÂ ![bulk_export_download_button.png](bulk_export_download_button.png), the previous export will be downloaded.Â
