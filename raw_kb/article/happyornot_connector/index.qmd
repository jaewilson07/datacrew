Intro
-----


HappyOrNot helps measure customer happiness levels. To learn more about the HappyOrNot API, visit their page (<https://reporting.happy-or-not.com/docs/api>).


You connect to your HappyOrNot account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the HappyOrNot connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your HappyOrNot account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* A HappyOrNotÂ company client identifier
* A HappyOrNot API token


You can generate these credentials in the HappyOrNot Reporting servicesÂ [Management view](https://reporting.happy-or-not.com/v2/#admin/company).Â Â If you do not have access to the HappyOrNot Reporting services, contact [support@happy-or-not.com](mailto:support@happy-or-not.com).


Connecting to Your HappyOrNot Account
-------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the HappyOrNot Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your HappyOrNot account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client Identifier | Enter your HappyOrNot company client identifier. |
| API Token | Enter your HappyOrNot API token. |


For more information about obtaining credentials, see "Prerequisites," above.


Once you have entered valid HappyOrNot credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new HappyOrNot DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Select the HappyOrNot report you want to run.Â The following reports are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Survey Results | Returns the results of the selected surveys. |
| Surveys List | Returns a list of surveys. |
| Questions List | Returns a list of survey questions. |

 |
| Surveys | Select the survey you want to retrieve information for. |
| Aggregate By | Select how you want the data in your report to be broken down. For example, if you selectÂ **Week**, the data will be broken down by week. |
| DurationÂ  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.Â  |
| Report DateÂ  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.Â  |
| Select Specific DateÂ  | Select the date for the report.Â  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.Â Â  |
| Start Date | Specify whether theÂ first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.Â You select the last date in your range inÂ **End Date**.Â  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range inÂ **Start Date**.Â Â  |
| Select Specific Start Date | SelectÂ the first date in your date range.Â  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.Â  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to End At**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
