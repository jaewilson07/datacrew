Intro
-----


ForeSee measures satisfaction with the customer experience and delivers insights on where organizations should prioritize improvements for maximum impact. Use Domo'sÂ ForeSeeÂ connector to return definitions and specific data for measures. To learn more about the ForeSee API, visit their page ([https://developer.foresee.com/docs/foresee-url-api](https://developer.foresee.com/docs/foresee-url-api "https://developer.foresee.com/v1.0/docs/public-api")).


You connect to your ForeSee account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the ForeSee connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your ForeSee account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* A ForeSee client ID
* A ForeSee client secret


Note that these credentials are different from those you might have had for older APIs. If you do not have a client ID or client Secret, contact Foresee Support.


Connecting to Your ForeSee Account
----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the ForeSee Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your ForeSee account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter your ForeSee client ID. |
| Client Secret | Enter your ForeSee client secret. |


Once you have entered valid ForeSee credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new ForeSee DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Select the ForeSee report you want to run.Â The following reports are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Measure Data | Returns information about each measure under contract with a client. |
| Measure Definition | Returns the definition or model for a specified measure. |

 |
| Measurement Key | Select the measurement key you want to retrieve information for. |
| Definition Type | Select the definition type you want to retrieve information for. |
| DurationÂ  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.Â  |
| Report DateÂ  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.Â  |
| Select Specific DateÂ  | Select the date for the report.Â  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.Â Â  |
| Start Date | Specify whether theÂ first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.Â You select the last date in your range inÂ **End Date**.Â  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range inÂ **Start Date**.Â Â  |
| Select Specific Start Date | SelectÂ the first date in your date range.Â  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.Â  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to End At**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |

FAQs
----


#### Can I use the same account multiple times to create DataSets?


Yes.


#### How often can the data be updated?


For DataSetsÂ with the Update Mode set to Append, it is best to run the DataSets once a day and retrieve only yesterday's data.


#### Are there any API limits I should be aware of?


No.
