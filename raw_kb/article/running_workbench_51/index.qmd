Intro
-----


Workbench consists of a service and an application.


TheÂ Workbench service runs as a Windows service, starting up automatically after the machine starts Windows.Â You can start, stop, or restart the service manually.Â   
For information about running the Workbench service, seeÂ [Starting, Stopping, and Restarting the Workbench 5.1 Service](..\starting_stopping_and_restarting_the_workbench_51_service\index.html "Starting, Stopping, and Restarting the Workbench 4 Service").


The Workbench application runs as a Windows program.Â You can run the application from the Windows Start menu.


Running Workbench from the Start menu
-------------------------------------


Follow the steps in this section to run Workbench from the Windows Start menu.


**To run the Workbench application,**



* ClickÂ **Start > Domo > Domo Workbench**.


You can also start the Workbench application by running the executable, which is typically installed toÂ C:\Program Files\Domo\Workbench.


**Note:** Workbench must be run as an Administrator in order to work.
For information about the controls and field settings in Workbench, seeÂ [Understanding the Workbench 5.1 User Interface](..\understanding_the_workbench_51_user_interface\index.html "Understanding the Workbench 4 User Interface").


Running Workbench from the command line
---------------------------------------
You can queue Workbench jobs from the command line using


`wb queue-job --server <url> --jobidÂ <id>`


where url is the server of your Domo instance (*[mycompany.domo.com](http://mycompany.domo.com)*) and jobid is the ID of the job.


For example:


`"C:\Program Files\Domo\Workbench\wb.exe" queue-jobÂ --server [acme.domo.com](http://acme.domo.com) --jobidÂ 505`


**Notes:**



* Workbench must be run as an Administrator in order to work.
* You can determine the ID of a job by selecting **File > Open Job**.
* In the server parameter, specify only the server not the http or https protocol.
* Workbench jobs run from the command line use the job and notification settings as specified per job in **Jobs > Job Settings** and **Job > Notifications**.
* Log entries for jobs processed at the command line are logged to a Workbench.DataCollector\_\_yyyy-mm-dd file in the job log folder.  
Typically, log files are located in C:\ProgramData\Domo\Workbench\logs.
* You cannot create a DataSet from the command line.  
Use Workbench to initially upload data when creating a DataSet.
* To successfully run a Workbench job from the command line, ensure the upload DataSetÂ is set to replace or append to an existing DataSet.
* In **File > Settings > Logging**, you can specify logging settings.  
For example, you can specify using local time in logs and cleaning up log files.
