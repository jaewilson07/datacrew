Intro
-----


District M is a digital media company that offers programmatic solutions to advertisers and publishers. To learn more about the District M API, visit their page (<https://www.districtm.net/>).


You connect to your District M account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the District M connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your District M account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* A District M client ID
* A District M client secret


These credentials are provided upon account creation.


Connecting to Your District M Account
-------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the District M Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your District M account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter your District M client ID. |
| Client Secret | Enter your District M client secret. |


Once you have entered valid District M credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new District M DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains two primary menus, **Reports** and **Fields**, along with various other options for configuring your report.
