Intro
-----


ClarizenÂ is cloud-based project management software that lets you manage work and collaborate across the enterprise. Use the Domo connector to receive data about project entities, user defined queries, expenses and more. To learn more about the Clarizen API, visit their page ([https://api.clarizen.com/v2.0/services/](https://api.clarizen.com/v2.0/services/ "https://api.clarizen.com/v2.0/services/")).


You connect to your Clarizen account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Clarizen connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Clarizen account and create a DataSet, you must have a Clarizen username and password.


Connecting to Your Clarizen Account
-----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Clarizen Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Clarizen account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the username for your Clarizen account. |
| Password | Enter the password for your Clarizen account. |


Once you have entered valid Clarizen credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Clarizen DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
