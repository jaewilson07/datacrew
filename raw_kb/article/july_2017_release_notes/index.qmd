New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Domo Everywhere: Embed


Domo is a business optimization tool that is unlike anything on the market. Combining a data warehouse with ETL tools, a collaboration platform, high-end visualizations, and the efficiency of a cloud platform, all available from any device at any time, makes Domo the ultimate tool for any level of business. Now, Domo is letting you take the content you've built and distribute it to your own customers or partners.  
  
Often, our customers wish to share insights with their own customer base or partners. Domo's Embedded Analytics feature now provides that capability by generating a piece of code that can be used in websites, customer portals, or any application. A secure connection through SSO providers ensures that content is delivered only to permitted end-users.  
  
Domo's embedded analytics are fully functioning Domo cards that live outside of the Domo platform. Users can enjoy features that let them explore the data in a card, including drill capabilities, filters, PDP (so users only see the data that applies to them), and the ability to easily change the visualizations and focus interactions.  
  
Welcome to the next evolution of Domo! The product you love is now available to anyone you wish to share it with, fully managed by you.

For detailed information about this feature, including step-by-step instructions for embedding cards as well as conditions for use, see [Sharing Cards Outside of Domo](/s/article/360043437973 "Sharing Cards Outside of Domo").


### Advanced Notebook Card


With the revamped notebook card, Domo enables all types of users to create notes and presentations with style. The new version of the notebook card includes the following features:



* Card locking while editingâ€”only one person can edit any given card at a time, preventing changes from being overwritten.
* Ability to add hyperlinks.
* Ability to add images from your computer/network or from the Internet.
* Ability to add tables.
* Ability to pick between three font sizes.
* Ability to change the font color and style.
* Ability to add nested lists.

### Java, Python, and Node SDKs


Domo now provides first-class SDKs to significantly reduce the level of effort needed to implement integrations with Domoâ€™s set of Public APIs. Domo SDKs eliminate extra layers of work needed to create and maintain the authentication connection to the API Gateway. These SDKs allow developers to create custom integrations much faster and easier without needing to manage the underlying communications infrastructure.


Additionally, these libraries have been made open-source to accelerate the time it takes for developers to leverage Domoâ€™s public endpoints and enables them to adapt and tailor each SDK to meet their specific needs.


Take a test drive today by visiting Domoâ€™s [Github repository](https://github.com/domoinc) or reviewing more details within our developer documentation:Â <https://developer.domo.com/docs/domo-sdks/sdks>. Or you can view our FAQ at [Public API SDKs FAQ](..\public_api_sdks_faq\index.html "Public API SDKs FAQ").


### Buzz Onboarding


Buzz now includesÂ promptings and easy, fast steps to follow to find and share immediate value. Add/edit your name and profile photo to enhance your communication. Send easy, one-click invitations to your network without worrying about who can or canâ€™t have access because of licensing restrictions or budget. New users will see unobtrusive blue dots, gently pulsating to draw attention to beneficial elements such as inviting others, creating new conversations, identifying important and favorite people, and optimizing conversations with the use of data.

For more information about Buzz, see [Buzz Onboarding](..\buzz_onboarding\index.html "Buzz Onboarding").


### No Friction Buzz Invite


Buzz is only as robust as the network of collaborators that exists within itâ€”a network organically grown by users inviting users. Users now are enabled to invite anyone at anytime, either directly using email addresses or by sharing a unique URL link with anyoneâ€”again, without worrying about growth constraints. Don't hesitate to get the right people in to collaborate whenever neededâ€”they're a simple click away.

### "What's Happening in Domo?" Email


Each week, Domo users will receive a personalized email that highlights interesting events in their Domo instanceâ€”such as new cards created, active Buzz conversations, and new usersâ€”that occurred over the previous week. The email also contains information on trending topics and Domo usage. In this way, Domo users can stay informed on activities that concern them. The email is sent every Monday morning (US Mountain Time).


Information in each email is based on the individual user's access privileges, favorites, etc. Access controls are fully enforced.Â 


![](4.png)


In the Notification Settings, you can turn off these emails if you want. You do this by changing settings for **Weekly Activity Report**.Â For more information, seeÂ [Configuring Notification and Alert Settings](..\configuring_notification_and_alert_settings\index.html "Configuring Notification and Alert Settings").
