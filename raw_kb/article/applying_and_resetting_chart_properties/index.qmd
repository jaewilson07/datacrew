Intro
-----


You can apply advanced properties to a chart using the **Chart Properties** tool. This can be found in the Analyzer for a chart, to the right of the chart. Setting properties to a chart can have far-reaching effects, so you can reset them if needed. 


Understanding chart properties
------------------------------


Available chart properties are different for each chart. Most charts have a specific set of categories of chart properties. For example, the Vertical Bar chart includes categories for **General**, **Bar Settings**, **Data Label Settings**, etc. Clicking any category in the Chart Properties brings up the available properties within that category. For example, for the Vertical Bar chart, clicking **General** would display properties for changing the font size, sorting on totals, and disabling animations.


A number to the right of a category name indicates the number of enabled properties within that category. In the following example, one property has been set within **General**, two have been set within **Bar Settings**, and so on.
