Intro
-----


Dial800 is a call performance marketing and communication tool. To learn more about the Dial800 API, visit their page ([https://www.dial800.com/solutions/call-tracking/](https://www.dial800.com/solutions/call-tracking/ "https://www.dial800.com/solutions/call-tracking/")).


You connect to your Dial800 account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Dial800 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Dial800 account and create a DataSet, you must have a Dial800 username and password.


Connecting to Your Dial800 Account
----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Dial800 Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Dial800 account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter your Dial800 username. |
| Password | Enter your Dial800 password. |


Once you have entered valid Dial800 credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Dial800 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
