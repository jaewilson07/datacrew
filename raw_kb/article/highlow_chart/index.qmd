Intro
-----


High-low charts are used to represent rises and falls in stock values. These charts are similar to [candlestick charts](..\candlestick_chart\index.html "Candlestick Graph") but are less complex, requiring only three columns (compared to five for a candlestick chart). For any given category, a vertical line is shown. The ends of the lines represent the high and low prices for the stock respectively.


Powering high-low charts
------------------------


High-low charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”a category column or row containing the name of each stock or the dates if you are showing a time progression for a single stock; and two columns or rows with the values. One of the columns or rows contains low values for the stocks or dates and the other contains high values. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your high-low chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.](..\..\category\analyzer\index.md)


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a high-low chart:

Customizing high-low charts

You can customize the appearance of a high-low chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ  [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
