There are two available tiles in the Dates and Numbers tab of Magic ETL DataFlows. These include:



* Calculator

For information about creating a Magic ETL DataFlow, see [Creating a Magic ETL DataFlow](..\creating_a_magic_etl_dataflow\index.html "Creating a Magic ETL DataFlow").


For information about the Data Center, see [Data Center Layout](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360047553253?language=en_US).
