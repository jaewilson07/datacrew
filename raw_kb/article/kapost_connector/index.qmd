Intro
-----


Kapost is a web content marketing platform that allows you to create and manage website content with ease. To learn more about the Kapost API, visit their page ([https://developer.kapost.com/](https://developer.kapost.com/ "https://developer.kapost.com/")).


You connect to your Kapost account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Kapost connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Kapost account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* A Kapost username and password.
* The URL of your company Kapost instance.


Connecting to Your Kapost Account
---------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Kapost Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Kapost account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter your Kapost username. |
| Password | Enter your Kapost password. |


Once you have entered valid Kapost credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Kapost DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
