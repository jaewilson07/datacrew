Intro
-----


A Percent of Total chart is a [Bar chart](..\bar_chart\index.html "Bar Graph")Â with a percent scale instead of a value scaleâ€”each category bar represents the relative size of its value as a percentage rather than the actual value. Percent of Total charts are essentially Pie charts with bars; however, because no legend is required to match names with categories, these charts are actually easier to read and interpret than Pie-type charts. As with basic Bar charts, both vertical and horizontal versions of Percent of Total charts are available.


Powering Percent of Total charts
--------------------------------


Percent of Total charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”one for categories and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Percent of Total chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder](..\analyzer_overview\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a vertical Percent of Total chart:
