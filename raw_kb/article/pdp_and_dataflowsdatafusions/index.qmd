Intro
-----


When setting up PDP (Personalized Data Permissions) policies on DataSetsÂ in Domo, you should be aware how those policies affect DataFlows and DataFusions.


PDP with DataFlows
------------------


Input DataSetsÂ in a DataFlowÂ cannot be restricted by PDP policiesâ€”all available rowsÂ *must*Â pass through the DataFlow. Because of this you must apply PDP policies to the output DataSets generated by a DataFlow.Â 


When you build a DataFlow using an input DataSetÂ with PDPÂ policies in place,Â the DataFlow breaks unlessÂ at least one of the following criteriaÂ applies:



* You have an "Admin" security profile or a custom role with "Manage DataFlows" enabled.
* You areÂ the DataSet owner.
* You areÂ part of the "All Rows" policy. This gives you access to all of the rows in the DataSet.


If a DataFlow breaks as a result of PDPÂ policies being applied toÂ input DataSets, you can fix it by adding the ownerÂ to the "All Rows" policy as follows:


1. Open theÂ **Personalized Data Permissions**Â tab for the PDP-affected DataSet.
2. Click **Impact**.  
  
This opens theÂ **PDP Outcomes for this DataSet**Â dialog, which lists all of the items in Domo that have been impacted as a result of PDP policies.Â For more information, seeÂ [Creating and Deleting PDP Policies](..\creating_and_deleting_pdp_policies\index.html "Creating and Deleting PDP Policies").
3. Click **Attention**.
4. In the list, locate the DataFlow you want to fix.
5. Click **Fix It**.


This adds the DataFlow owner to the "All Rows" policy for this DataSet. The DataFlowÂ can now be run as normal.


PDP with DataFusions
--------------------


Â PDP can be applied to both input and output DataFusion DataSets.Â 


If you are creating a DataFusionÂ that includes one or more DataSets with PDP enabled, you must have "all rows" access for those DataSets.


If the owner of a DataFusion loses access to one or more PDP-enabledÂ input DataSets, the DataFusion will be disabled.
