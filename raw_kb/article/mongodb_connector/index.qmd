Intro
-----


MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database system that stores structured data as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. Domo provides connectors that allow you to pull data from aÂ MongoDBÂ collection and compile custom reports.Â 



* The MongoDB connectorÂ uses Java driver version 3.2.1,Â andÂ supports Find and Aggregate query methods.Â You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB connector.
* The MongoDB Advanced connector uses Java driver version 3.2.1, andÂ supports a plain JSON query. You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDBÂ Advanced connector.
* The MongoDB V2 connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports Find and Aggregate query methods.Â You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB V2 connector. Also, MongoDB V2 connector doesnâ€™t require a CA certificate.
* TheÂ MongoDB SSH Connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supportsÂ Find and Aggregate query methods.Â You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB SSH connector. You need your SSH credentials (host, port, username, and password)Â to pull data from a MongoDB collectionÂ through an SSH tunnel.


This article discusses theÂ **MongoDBÂ Connector**. You can use Domo's MongoDB Connector to pull data from a MongoDB collection and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting JSON queries. For more information about the MongoDB API, go toÂ <http://api.mongodb.org/>.


The MongoDB connector is a "Database" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking **Database** in the toolbar at the top of the window.


This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to theÂ MongoDB connector user interface.Â For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, seeÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


**Important:** An SSL connection is required for this connector to work.Â
Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to aÂ MongoDB collection and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* The username and password you use to log into yourÂ MongoDB database
* The host name for the database server (e.g.Â [db.company.com](http://db.company.com)).
* The port number for the database
* The authentication database name
* The name of the collection you want to connect to
* The CA certificate text or URL path is requiredÂ *only*Â if you selectÂ **CertificateÂ String**Â orÂ **URL Path**,Â respectively, in theÂ **CertificateÂ Format**Â menu.
* An SSL connection


**Note:** MongoDB uses "admin" as the database name to establish a connection.
Before you can connect to a MongoDBÂ database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on theÂ portÂ you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, seeÂ [Whitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors](..\allowlisting_ip_addresses_for_connectors__federated_adapters\index.html "Whitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors").


Connecting toÂ aÂ MongoDB Collection
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in theÂ **Credentials**Â andÂ **Details**Â panes in theÂ MongoDBÂ Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,Â **Scheduling**Â andÂ **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to a collection within a MongoDB database. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Host | Enter the host name for the MongoDB database. For example:  [db.company.com](http://db.company.com)  |
| Database Name | Enter the name of the MongoDB authentication database. This needs to be the specific database the user was created in. |
| CollectionÂ  | Enter the name of the collection you want to connect to.
**Note:** A collection belonging to a database different than the authentication database can be accessed using **databaseName.collectionName** syntax. |
| Username | Enter yourÂ MongoDB username. |
| Password | Enter yourÂ MongoDB password. |
| Database Port | Enter the port number for the MongoDB database. |
| Certificate Format | SelectÂ the certificate format. If you do not want to include a certificate, selectÂ **No Certificate**. If you selectÂ **CertificateÂ String**, you must paste the text for your certificate in theÂ **Certificate** field. If you selectÂ **URL Path**, you must enter the URL where your certificate is located in theÂ **Certificate** field. Â Â  |
| Certificate | Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.Â This is optional. If you do not want to include a certificate, select **No Certificate** in the **CertificateÂ Format** menu. |


After you have entered validÂ MongoDB credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a MongoDB DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in theÂ **Accounts**Â tab in theÂ Data CenterÂ . For more information about this tab, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


In this pane you create a JSON query to pull data from your MongoDB collection. You can also create optionalÂ WHERE,Â SELECT,Â GROUP, andÂ SORTÂ clauses, also in JSON format.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| JSON Query | Enter theÂ JSON query to use in selecting the data you want. Two query methods are available, Find and Aggregate.Â As an example, let's suppose you have a collectionÂ with the following data:
`{ "_id" : 1, "subject" : "History", "score" : 88 }, { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "History", "score" : 92 }, { "_id" : 3, "subject" : "History", "score" : 97 }, { "_id" : 4, "subject" : "History", "score" : 71 }, { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "History", "score" : 79 }, { "_id" : 6, "subject" : "History", "score" : 83 }`Â 
**Find:Â**You could use the Find method to select from this collection all documents where the subject equals "History." The query would be formatted as follows:
`{ subject: "History" }`
**Aggregate:Â**To use the Aggregate method, your query will look something like the following:
`[ Â  Â { Â  Â  Â  $match: { Â  Â  Â  Â  score: { Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  $gt: 80 Â  Â  Â  Â  } Â  Â  Â  } Â  Â  }, Â  Â  { Â  Â  Â  $count: "passing_scores" Â  Â  } Â  ]`Â 
In this example,Â the $match stage excludes documents that have a score value of less than or equal to 80 to pass along the documents with a score greater than 80 to the next stage.Â The $count stage returns a count of the remaining documents in the aggregation pipeline and assigns the value to a field called "passing scores." |
| Where Clause JSON | Enter a WHERE clause in JSON format. |
| Select Clause JSON | Enter a SELECT clause in JSON format. |
| Group Clause JSON | Enter a GROUP clause in JSON format. |
| Sort Clause JSONÂ  | Enter aÂ SORT clause in JSON format.Â  |
