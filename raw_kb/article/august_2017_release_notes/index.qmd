New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Analyzer (formerly Card Builder)


Introducing the new Analyzerâ€”data exploration, powerful analytics, insights, and a self-guided experience all in one place. As data continues to flow into businesses like never before and the breadth of different data sources increases, the new Analyzer is an analytic heaven for analysts to explore, discover, sliceÂ andÂ dice, and empower others to stop making decisions with their gut and start making decisions with data.


All of the following new and updated features are now available:


**User Interface**. Weâ€™ve added a beautiful new design with additional flexibility so you can be the driver of your own workspace, using the analytic tools you want when you need them.


![](0.png)


For more information about the Analyzer user interface, seeÂ [Analyzer Layout](..\analyzer_layout\index.html "Analyzer Layout").  
  
**Period-over-Period**.Â With the powerful and flexible Period-over-Period experience in Analyzer, youâ€™ll be able to compare numerous time periods to see trends and comparisons. No other BI tool has an easier Period-over-Period experience. All you need is a date range, and your options are endless: Year over Year, Quarter over Quarter, Past 30 days, and many other options. Want to see a growth trend in your sales performance for the past few years, and add a variance percentage line along with that? Done and done.Â Measure the past 30 days vs any previous days? Compare monthly sales to the same day 4, 8, 12, even 52 weeks ago? We'veÂ got you covered. Analyzer makes the visualization of trends even easier.

For more information about implementing Period-over-Period chart, including use cases, seeÂ [Period-over-Period Charts](..\periodoverperiod_charts\index.html "Period-over-Period Charts").  
  
**Quick Filters**. Quick Filters are pre-defined filters that live on a card to help guide and focus management to see results in specific areas. As analysts explore their data and find important insights, they want to share these answers with management. With Quick Filters, you now can easily create a self-guided experience for others to explore data on a card and answer questions for themselves. Quick Filters you set will appear on cards in both the desktop and mobile versions of Domo.

Â 


For more information about Quick Filters, seeÂ Adding Filters to Your Chart - Applying Quick Filters.  
  
**Data Lineage**.Â Trusting your data is critical. As you find answers and explore your data, you need to be confident all the data is up-to-date and running smoothly. Since Domo can effectively bring all your data into one place as no other tool can, you may need to see all your data is combining correctly for true peace of mind. With the new Data Lineage in Analyzer, you can see the data is flowing correctly and on time without having to check the Data Center.


![](6.png)


For more information, seeÂ [Viewing the Lineage of a DataSet in Analyzer](..\viewing_the_lineage_of_a_dataset_in_analyzer\index.html "Viewing the Lineage of a DataSet in Analyzer").  
Â   
**Conditional Colors**.Â As analysts explore their data, itâ€™s often important to have consistent colors in order to highlight exceptions. If, for instance, you want a specific company to be blue or red on a DataSet to more easily identify those trends spanning many charts, you would need the Conditional Color in Analyzer. This new feature enables you to see exceptions and trends with a consistent colorâ€”making analysis even easier.


![](7.png)


For more information, seeÂ [Setting Color Rules for a Chart](..\setting_color_rules_for_a_chart\index.html "Setting Color Rules for a Chart").


**Data Table**.Â The new Data Table in Analyzer allows you to see and manipulate the data in all columns you have applied to your chart, along with any other unused columns you want to show. Changes you make to the data in the Data Table are reflected in your chart preview. Likewise, when you make changes to the chart using other tools such as filters and sorting, the data in the table is updated.


![](8.png)


For more information, seeÂ [Understanding the Data Table in Analyzer](..\understanding_the_data_table_in_analyzer\index.html "Understanding the Data Table in Analyzer").  
  
**60+ New Chart Types and Improved Table Card**. The new Analyzer includes over 60 new chart types. Weâ€™ve also enhancedÂ table cardsÂ with colors, % to total, and sub totals. All of these inclusions enables more analysis and less paralysis.


New chart types include the following:



* Vertical and horizontal MarimekkoÂ graphs
* Vertical and horizontal Overlay graphs
* Vertical Line graphs
* Vertical and horizontal Lollipop graphs
* 19 new Area graphs
* Data Science graphs (Predictive Modeling, Forecasting, Outliers, and XY Line)
* Nautilus & Nautilus Donut graphs
* Nightingale Rose graph
* Stream & Stream Funnel graphs
* 4 new mapsâ€”Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Indonesia


Here are screenshots of just a few of the new chart types available in Analyzer:

### Snapshot Annotation


Letâ€™s face it, data is messy.Â It's easy to feel overwhelmed and lost when trying to decipher data visualizations. Now you can clarify the chaos with the new Snapshot Annotation feature. Pictures are worth a thousand words, and probably more when working with data. Snapshot Annotations makes analytic life easier for everyone.  
  
With the Snapshot Annotation feature, you donâ€™t need to use thousands of words to call out trends and insights. When you see a spike or trends in your data, you can now annotate on any card. Specifically, you can now draw free-form, place shapes, write text, and highlight, on any cardâ€” both on the web and on your mobile device. Then, once youâ€™ve made things more clear, sharing annotated cards is seamless in Buzz. Everyone now can spend less typing and more time making business decisions.  
  
Analysts, Managers, Senior Execs, and all data consumers need tools to help craft their data story or to visually call attention to important trends and differences on their charts. Having annotation tools makes analytic life easier for everyone because it's more efficient to communicate with visual tools to help educate others.

#### DataSet via Email Connector


The Dataset via Email connector enables you to get your data into Domo quickly and easily by capturing and processing .xls, .xlsx, and .csv files that have been included as attachments to an email. When you configure this connector, it generates a unique email address that corresponds to your Dataset via Email DataSet in Domo. Once the email address is created, you can send the spreadsheet as an attachment to that email address. The connector will then process the email and update your data accordingly.


For more information, seeÂ [DataSet via Email Connector](..\dataset_via_email_connector\index.html "DataSet via Email Connector").


### Workbench UI Improvements


#### List View


Workbench now includesÂ a list view that allowsÂ you toÂ searchÂ and sortÂ DataSet jobs, see upcoming schedules, and organize jobs by status,Â giving better visibility into jobs to facilitate job managementÂ in an instance.


![](16.png)


#### Status Panel


The new Status Panel in Workbench provides you withÂ better insights around when jobs are being run and allowsÂ youÂ to make changes, pause, cancel and run jobs. The Status Panel will be visible from every job details page to give real-time information about job status.


![](17.png)


### Rank &Â Window FunctionsÂ in Magic ETL


Domo's Magic ETLÂ tool now includesÂ Rank &Â WindowÂ functions. These new functions enable you to rank and compare data without having to be familiar with complex SQL functions and syntax.Â These functions are available in Magic ETL in a new action tile called **Rank & Window**, whichÂ can be found in the **Edit Columns** section.


The new Rank &Â Windows functions include all of the following:



* Rank
* Dense Rank
* Row Number
* Avg
* Count
* Sum
* Lag
* Lead


![](18.png)


For detailed information about each of these functions and step-by-step instructions for using them, see [ETL Actions: Rank and Window](..\old_magic_etl_tiles_rank_and_window\index.html "ETL Actions: Rank and Window").


### Self-Service Payments


Beginning August 10th, existing Domo customers will be able to add and pay for licenses right from within the Domo product. With this change, please be aware of the following:



* This will be rolled out over time, so some customers may not see this change right away.
* The price you see is based on your current contract.
* Tax is applied to the purchase price in the product.Â


### Mobile Page Filters


We have taken the powerful and complex page filters tool and released it to the mobile platform in an accessible and intuitive way. Any business user can immediately gain value. Whether you're an executive walking into one of your retail stores or a manufacturing manager looking at a specific product line, you can quickly filter your full page to find the story.


Try it out for yourself. Navigate to any of your pages in Domo on mobile, tap into the menu, and filter away.


![](19.png)


### Mobile Card/Page Sharing


Domo has introduced a simple way to collaborate even more easily while on your phone. Have an important card or page you need to share with an individual or your team? Do it now from your phone. As of today you can tap into any card or page and easily share it with others.


### Page API


With Domoâ€™s Page public API, users can now automate the creation or duplication of pages and seamlessly update the pageâ€™s content. The ability to manage pages through the API gives you the ability to create systems and processes to easily share existing information and content inside a Domo page that can be tailored to any situation that arises.


To begin developing with Domoâ€™s Pages API requires little effort. Once you create authentication tokens in the developer portalâ€™s [client section](https://developer.domo.com/manage-clients), you can then explore the Page API functionality by following the steps within the [Page API Quickstart](https://developer.domo.com/docs/page/quickstart-6 "https://developer.domo.com/docs/page/quickstart-6")Â guide or by downloading pre-built Page API examples from any of Domoâ€™s official [SDK libraries](https://github.com/domoinc).


### Developer Sandbox


By obtaining a sandbox, developers can nowÂ quickly explore, iterate, and accelerate their development cycles on Domoâ€™s APIs. A developer sandbox also empowers developers with a self-service tool to simulate scenarios with APIs to better understand and handle certain error conditions. This ultimately enables the creation of more resilient applications that can be confidently introduced into production environments.


The option to obtain a developer sandbox is now availableÂ in Domoâ€™s Developer portal, <https://developer.domo.com/dev-sandbox-request>.Â  After you submit a request for your sandbox, a new Domo instance is created automatically, and an invitation is sentÂ to your email to activate your login.Â 


Once you activate your account, you will then be able to explore specific developer links in your Sandbox as well as leverage pre-built sample data, cards, and content to begin developing solutions.
