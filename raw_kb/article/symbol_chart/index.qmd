Intro
-----


Symbol charts are similar to Grouped Bar charts in that series items are represented side by side within their respective categories. However, instead of bars, Symbol charts use symbols to indicate series values. This may help viewers identify highs and lows within their data. However, Symbol charts also haveÂ a disadvantage in that it may be hard toÂ tell exactly what value a particular symbol falls on. For this reason, these charts are best used for showing relative values rather than comparing specific numbers. Symbol charts are nearly identical toÂ Symbol OverlayÂ charts, the difference being that in a Symbol Overlay chart, symbolsÂ in a given series areÂ overlaid on top of each other rather than shown side by side.Â Â Â Â 


Symbol charts include both vertical and horizontal subtypes. In a vertical Symbol chart, categoriesÂ are represented along the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and valuesÂ are measured on the vertical axis (or y-axis).Â A horizontalÂ Symbol chart has the same overall concept, but the categories are represented along the vertical axis and the values are represented along the horizontal axis.


PoweringÂ Symbol charts
-----------------------


AÂ Symbol chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSetâ€”one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for yourÂ Symbol chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into aÂ vertical SymbolÂ chart:

The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into aÂ horizontal SymbolÂ chart:

CustomizingÂ Symbol charts
--------------------------


You can customize the appearance of aÂ Symbol chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
