Intro
-----


The Segments feature allows you to create better comparisons of a Segment versus another group. It also allows you to dynamically filter one item and not have the filter impact the Segment so that you can compare the two results. You can add a Segment to any multi-series chart, period over period chart, or multi-value chart. You can also add Segments to the Card Details view of a Card and to Dashboards.

Parts of the Segment Creation Window
------------------------------------




| **Field** | **Description** |
| Segment name | Add the name of the Segment.
**Note:** Ensure that the name of the Segment matches the item you are filtering in your data. For example, if you are selecting where the Product column equals "Toys" then you would name the Segment Toys. Otherwise, your chart will display both the original data for "Toys" and the new Segment for "Toys" instead of the Segment replacing the existing data for "Toys". |
| Description | Add an optional description of what the Segment contains. |
| Filter columns to create a segment | Add the columns that define the Segment. These will filter the Segment. |
| Do not filter this segment by the following columns | Add columns that will not filter the Segment. |
| Segment Color Rules - Card Color | Choose what color the Segment value will show on the chart. The color selected will only display on this specific Card.
**Note:** If a Card Color is selected it will override the DataSet Color. |
| Segment Color Rules - Dataset Color | Choose what color the Segment value will show on the DataSet. The Segment will always display this unless a Card Color has been set. |
| Segment preview | This will display the columns defined in the Segment. |
