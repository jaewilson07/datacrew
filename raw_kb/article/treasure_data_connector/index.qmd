Intro
-----


Treasure Data is a cloud data management platform that lets users in your organization connect and access live data. To learn more about the Treasure Data API, visit their page (<https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001260527-REST-APIs-in-Treasure-Data>).
You connect to your Treasure Data account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Treasure Data connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


This connector can retrieve data from standard DataSets within Treasure Data by submitting jobs to Treasure Data and then importing the results. In some cases, you may actually be using Treasure Data's more advanced DataTank service. To connect to Treasure Data's DataTank, please use Domo's [PostgreSQL](..\postgresql_connector\index.html "PostgreSQL Connector") database connector. To configure it, you will need to contact Treasure Data to get the necessary information, including the IP address and port of the DataTank server as well as login credentials.


For assistance, please contact Treasure Data.


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Treasure Data account and create a DataSet, you must have a Treasure Data API key. For information about obtaining an API key, visit the following page:Â <https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000763288-Get-API-Keys>


Connecting to Your Treasure Data Account
----------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Treasure Data Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Treasure Data account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â

 |


Once you have entered valid Treasure Data credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Treasure Data DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
