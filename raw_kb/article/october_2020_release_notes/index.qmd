New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


Beast Mode Manager
------------------


Improvements to Beast Mode Manager make managing your Beast Modes even easier.


### Archive Beast Modes


You now have the ability to archive Beast Modes. This removes Beast Modes from Cards or DataSets. You are only able to archive a Beast Mode if it is not in use on a Card. The archive feature is also available for bulk use. You can select up to 100 Beast Modes at a time when using bulkÂ archive. There is no limit to the total amount of Beast Modes that you can archive.


You can then unarchiveÂ Beast Modes and it will restore it to the Card or DataSet it originated from. If a Card or DataSet is deleted, then the Beast Mode is also deleted. For more information, see [Beast Mode Manager](..\beast_mode_manager\index.html "Beast Mode Manager").

### Duplicate Beast Mode name modal


Inside of Analyzer, there is a new modal that appears when there is a duplicate Beast Mode name. This allows you to rename the Beast Mode or delete duplicate Beast Modes. For more information, seeÂ [Adding a Beast Mode Calculation to Your Chart](..\adding_a_beast_mode_calculation_to_your_chart\index.html "Adding a Beast Mode Calculation to Your Chart").

Enhanced Connector scheduling
-----------------------------


The new Connector scheduler showcases a simplifiedÂ and streamlined UI that is easier to understand andÂ displaysÂ your time zone when scheduling.Â ConnectorsÂ are still scheduled in UTC, but our new SchedulerÂ shows you what time that converts to in your chosenÂ time zone. For more information, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").

**Available Code Block types:**



* Beast Modes
* SQL
* R
* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks

PublicÂ DomoÂ App assets
------------------------


You now have the abilityÂ to share assets like pictures or javascript code between your custom Domo app and your public website. You also have the optionÂ to build your public website directly on Domo instead of having to find another hosting provider. For more information, see [Public Domo App Assets](..\public_domo_app_assets\index.html "Public Domo App Assets").


Buzz Conversation toggle
------------------------


With the new Buzz Conversation toggle arrows, you can easily switch between yourÂ Buzz messages. Use the arrows to move back and forth through conversations as you viewed them. For more information, see [Buzz Layout](..\buzz_layout\index.html "Buzz Layout").

Goals
-----


With Domo Goals you can power your company objectives by measurable data, watch progress with automatic updates and alerts, and create top to bottom alignment. With Goals you also have visibility into everyoneâ€™s goals andÂ track how goals interrelate and progress. For more information, see [Creating and Editing Goals](/s/article/360047711914 "Creating and Editing Goals").


**With Goals you can,**



* Set company, department, andÂ personal goals that everyone can view.
* Measure the results with metrics powered by data in Domo.
* Align your objectives with your company, department,Â andÂ team so everyone can see how your work fits into the big picture.
* View your progress as it updates in real-time with your data.
* Check-in with regular updates so everyone knows how youâ€™re progressing.
* Create powerful dashboards to analyze your companyâ€™s progress.
* Easily show which individual objectives align with company goals.

Federated Data
--------------


Domo's Federated Data model allows you to directly render Cards and other user-level interactions in the Domo platform using a database hosted outside of Domo's cloud. Instead of executing the visualization query against Domo, the query is executed at the target database and the results are sent to Domo to render the visualization. This model is especially relevant for users who would like to keep their data at rest in their infrastructure for security or logistical reasons. For more information, see [Using the Federated Data Solution](..\using_the_federated_data_solution\index.html "Using the Federated Data Solution").

Magic ETL v2 (Beta)
-------------------


Magic ETL v2 (Beta) has many backendÂ and tile improvementsÂ as well as new tiles. When you open the edit view of a Magic ETL DataFlow, there is now a toggle switch to enable Magic ETL v2. It is important to note that some of the tiles have changed their functionality. For more information, see [Magic ETLÂ v2 DataFlow Optimizations](..\magic_etl_dataflow_auto_append_processing\index.html "Magic ETL v2 DataFlow Optimizations (Beta)").

**Important:** You **MUST** read through the following article before switching an existing Magic ETL DataFlow to v2 or you risk breaking your DataFlow as several tiles have changed their functionality:Â [Upgrading to Magic ETL v2](..\behavior_changes_and_feature_updates_in_magic_etl\index.html "Upgrading to Magic ETL v2 (Beta)")
