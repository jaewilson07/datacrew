Backing up DataSet jobs isÂ an often overlooked task when using Workbench. You may be wondering why jobs need to be backed up if theyâ€™re stored in the Domo cloud. Accidents can happen. Jobs can be accidentally deleted by Workbench users, which will also permanently delete them from the cloud. Further, if the account is accidentally removed from Workbench, all jobs are deleted from the cloud. Exporting your jobs ensures you have a fallback option in the event of a problem.


Your exported job files should be stored somewhere safe, as they can contain secure information including API keys, queries, database and/or filenames, etc. Treat them the same as you would passwords or financial information.
