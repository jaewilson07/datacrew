Intro
-----


Like gauges, bullet charts are used to depict progress towards a goal, and contain ranges so that values can be classified accordingly. For example, a bullet chart could have three rangesâ€”"poor," "average," and "excellent."Â Each value would fall into one of these ranges. Bullet charts are more complex and powerful than standard gauges in that they can be used to measure multiple data values in a smaller space, providing a richer and more meaningful viewing experience.


Bullet charts are available in both vertical and horizontal sub-types. In vertical bullet charts, categories are represented along the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and values are measured on the vertical axis (or y-axis). horizontal bullet charts are the opposite, with categories along the vertical axis and values measured on the horizontal axis.

Powering bullet charts
----------------------


Bullet charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet in order to be powered upâ€”however, if you want to include key features such as ranges and target values, you will need to specify additional columns. A bullet chart with target values and three ranges requires six data columnsâ€”one for values, one for categories, one for target values, and one for each of the three ranges. Boundaries for each range are determined using the specified range value and the value of the next lowest range, or 0 forÂ **Range1**. For example, if the value forÂ **Range1**Â was "33," the value forÂ **Range2**Â was "66," and the value forÂ **Range3** was "100," the boundaries of the lowest range would be 0 and 33; the boundaries of the middle range would be 34 and 66, and the values of the highest range would be 67 and 100.


For information about value, category, and series data, seeÂ [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your bullet chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").

Customizing bullet charts
-------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a bullet chart by editing itsÂ **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
