In a user'sÂ ProfileÂ page, you can see that person'sÂ Buzz conversations and comments, photos, tasks, and status updates that have received "likes." You do this in theÂ **Likes**Â tab, which is located in the tab row under the user statistics panel.

**To see a user's "liked" items,**


1. Navigate to that user'sÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking the user's profile picture anywhere it appears then clickingÂ **Go to Profile**Â in the avatar card. If you want to see your own "liked" items, you can access your personalÂ **Profile**Â page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, aÂ ![](1.png)Â icon appears instead.)
2. ClickÂ **Likes**Â in the tab row under the user statistics panel.  
   
 TheÂ **Likes** tab contains a number of subtabs, as follows:



| Subtab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| All | Shows all of the user'sÂ Buzz conversations and comments, tasks, photos, and statuses that have received "likes." |
| Conversations | Shows all initialÂ Buzz discussion posts from this user that have received "likes." For more information about Buzz, seeÂ [Buzz](..\..\category\buzz\index.html "Buzz"). |
| Comments | Shows allÂ Buzz comments from this user that have received "likes." For more information about Buzz, seeÂ [Buzz](..\..\category\buzz\index.html "Buzz"). |
| Tasks | Shows all of this user's tasks that have received "likes." For more information about projects and tasks, see [Projects and Tasks](..\..\category\projects_and_tasks\index.html "Projects and Tasks"). |
| Photos | Shows all of this user's personal photos that have received "likes." For more information about personal photos, see [Managing Your Personal Photos](..\managing_your_personal_photos\index.html "Managing Your Personal Photos"). |
| Statuses | Shows all of this user's statuses that have received "likes." For more information about status updates, seeÂ [Entering Status Updates](..\entering_status_updates\index.html "Entering Status Updates"). |

Each "liked" item appears in its own card. For any item, you can mouse over the "thumbs up" icon to see which users have liked the item; you can also click it to like it yourself.
