You can use theÂ **Search & Replace** transform to replace aÂ specified value in a column with another value. You can also specify a default value to appear in cells in which your search value does not appear.

After searching for values in your dataÂ by specifying a **Search Value**, you can transform the valuesÂ using regular expressions. For example, suppose you want to transform the date format of date values. Using regular expressions in the **SearchÂ Value** and **ReplaceÂ With** fields, you could search for dates with a format of yyyymmdd and replace them with a format of yyyy-mm-dd by doing the following:



* Setting the **SearchÂ Value** field to  
  
`([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})`


This regular expression searches for values, storing them in variables with 4 digits, 2 digits, and 2 digits (for dates in the form yyyymmdd).
* Setting the **ReplaceÂ With** field to  
  
`$1-$2-$3`


This regular expression replaces the variables ($1, $2, $3) found in the **Search String** regular expression, resulting in the $1-$2-$3 format for dates in the form yyy-mm-dd.


Workbench 5 includes a Regular Expression Builder to help you construct regular expressions for yourÂ "Search" value and/or "Replace with" value. You can open the Regular Expression Builder by clicking the ellipsis (...) to the right of theÂ **Include filterÂ**field. In the Builder, you canÂ select from a wide variety of constructs to use in yourÂ search or replacementÂ string. These constructs are divided into categories for easy navigation (grouping constructs, character escapes, substitutions, etc.). Descriptions are provided for each construct.

**To replace a value in a column,**


1. In Workbench, click ![wb5_jobs_icon.png](wb5_jobs_icon.png)Â in the left-hand icon bar.
2. In the Jobs listing, double-clickÂ the DataSet job with column values you want to replace.
3. Click **Transforms**Â to expand that section of the pane.
4. In theÂ **Add a transform**Â menu, selectÂ **Search/Replace Transform**.
5. Click the ![wb5_add_transform_icon.png](wb5_add_transform_icon.png)Â button.  
TheÂ **Search/Replace Transform Editor**Â appears.
6. In theÂ **Search Column** menu, select the column in which you want to replace values.
7. In theÂ **Search Value** field, enter the value you want to replace or insert a regular expression using the Regular Expression Builder.
8. In the **Replace With** field, enter the value that should replace the value you entered in step 7 or insert a regular expression using the Regular Expression Builder.
9. (Optional) In the **Alternate Replace** field, specify a default value to appear in cells in which your search value does not appear.
10. ClickÂ ****Apply****.
11. Click ![wb5_save_icon.png](wb5_save_icon.png)Â at the top of the pane to save your transform.
