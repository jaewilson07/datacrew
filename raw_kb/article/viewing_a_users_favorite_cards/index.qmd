In a user'sÂ ProfileÂ page, you can view cards that that user has added as Favorites. You do this in theÂ **Favorites**Â tab, which is located in the tab row under the user statistics panel.

For any card in theÂ **Favorites**Â tab, you can click on the name or thumbnail image to open theÂ [Details view](..\card_details_view_layout\index.html "Card Details View Layout")Â for that card.


**To view a user's favorite cards,**


1. Navigate to that user'sÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking that user's profile picture anywhere it appears. If you want to view your own favorite cards, you can access your personalÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, aÂ ![](1.png)Â icon appears instead.)
2. ClickÂ **Favorites**Â in the tab row under the user statistics panel.
