Intro
-----


In the Appstore, you can selectÂ apps to add to your Domo instance, view information on all installedÂ apps, and remove installed apps. The Appstore is composed of a main page divided intoÂ several tabs, as follows:




| Name | Icon | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | appstore_home_tab_icon.png | Shows you featured apps, QuickStarts, new and trending apps, and connectors.Â  |
| Search | appstore_search_tab_icon.png | Lets you search for specific Appstore content using a variety of filters and search options. |
| Installed | appstore_installed_tab_icon.png | Shows all apps that have been installed in your DomoÂ instance.Â  |
| Asset Library | appstore_asset_library_tab_icon.png | Shows both pending and live apps you have created as well as custom app designs. |
| Store Manager | appstore_manage_tab_icon.png | Allows you to see all apps that have been pushed to publication and choose whether to grant or deny publication for apps in this list. You must have a default security role of "Admin" or a custom role with the "Manage Appstore" grant enabled to access this tab. For more information about security roles, seeÂ [Managing Custom Roles](https://domohelp.domo.com/Administer/Controlling_Access_in_Domo/Managing_Custom_Roles "Managing Custom Roles"). |


Â 


You can switch between tabs by clicking the icon for the desired tab in the left-hand navigation pane. If the pane is not visible, you can clickÂ ![alert_center_expand_names.png](alert_center_expand_names.png)Â to open it.Â 


If you click a thumbnail for an app or connector in the **HomeÂ**or **Search**Â tab, a Details/install page opens for the app or connector. For more information about connectors, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


You are not limited to one version of an app per company Domo instance. For example, multiple users could each have their own version of the FacebookÂ QuickStart app. Each user's individual version of the FacebookÂ QuickStart app would contain cards powered up by his or her personal Facebook data.


â€‹Appstore tabs
----------------


This section discusses each of the tabs in the Appstore. Â 


### HomeÂ tabÂ


TheÂ **Home**Â tab contains a carousel of recommended apps you can navigate through. It also contains cardsÂ for all apps available to be installed in your Domo, as well as all connectors. This is the default tab that appears when you open the Appstore. If you navigate to another tab, you can return here by clicking theÂ ![appstore_home_tab_icon.png](appstore_home_tab_icon.png)Â icon in the left-hand navigation pane.Â 


The following screenshot points out the most important parts of theÂ **HomeÂ**tab:


![appstore_2020_home_tab.png](appstore_2020_home_tab.png)


You can learn about the components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Categories filter | Lets you filter to locate apps belonging to a specific category. When you click a filter, theÂ **Search**Â tab opens with your category filter already applied.Â  |
| Search bar | Lets you search for specific apps by typing keywords. When you search in this way, the **Search**Â tab then opens with your search already applied. Keywords are matched to both names and descriptions. So if you typed "mail" as a keyword, the MailChimpÂ QuickStart app would appear, as well as any apps or connectors with the word "mail" in their descriptions. |
| Featured apps carousel | Displays featured apps in Domo. Click an app in the carousel to display the details view for that app. You can scroll through the previews by mousing over the carousel and clicking theÂ app_carousel_scroll_left.png andÂ app_carousel_scroll_right.pngÂ buttons that appear.Â  |
| QuickStarts pane | Displays featured QuickStart apps. Click a QuickStartÂ to open its details view. You can see all QuickStartÂ apps in the **Search**Â tab by clickingÂ **View All**.Â  |
| New and trending apps pane | Displays new and trending apps (with "trending" status based on metadata such as the number of times the app has been deployed). Click an app to open its details view. You can see all new and trending apps in the **Search**Â tab by clickingÂ **View All**. |
| Connectors pane | Shows Domo connectors. By default, onlyÂ a fewÂ connectors are shown; click **View All** to show all connectors in the **SearchÂ**tab. Click a connector to open the details view for that connector. For more information aboutÂ connectors, seeÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md). Â  |
| Capabilities filter | Lets you filter to locate data science apps, enterprise apps, writeback connectors, or DataFlow-related apps. When you click a filter, theÂ **Search**Â tab opens with your capability filter already applied.Â  |

| Name | Description |

| Search bar | Lets you type keywords to filter the apps in the **Search** tab. Keywords are matched to both app names and descriptions. So if you typed "mail" as a keyword, the MailChimpÂ QuickStart app would appear, as well as any appsÂ with the word "mail" in their descriptions. |

### AssetÂ Library tab


The **AssetÂ Library** tab shows you all of the apps you have pushed to publication along with your custom designs. This tab has three quick filters that can be appliedâ€”**My** **Apps**,Â **Shared With** **Me**, and **All Apps**. In theÂ **My Apps** filter, you can view all of your apps or filter to see those that are pending or live. In **Shared With Me**, you can view all apps that have been shared with you. In the **All Apps** filter, if you are an Admin, you can see all the apps in your instance. For more information about the Asset Library, see [Asset Library](..\asset_library\index.md). For more information about the app-building process, visit the developer portal at [developer.domo.com](https://developer.domo.com/).Â 


### Store Manager tab


In theÂ Store Manager, you can manage the publication process for apps that have been published in your company Domo instance. You access this tab by clicking ![appstore_manage_tab_icon.png](appstore_manage_tab_icon.png)Â in the Appstore in the left-hand navigation pane. This tabÂ consists of three subtabsâ€”**Pending**, which shows apps that have been pushed to the Appstore in your company Domo instance butÂ have not been approved or denied;Â **Live**, whichÂ shows all apps that have been approved for publication by an administrator; andÂ **Denied**, which shows apps that have been denied publication.


You must have a default security role of "Admin" or a custom role with the "Manage Appstore" grant enabled to access this tab. For more information about security roles, seeÂ [Managing Custom Roles](https://domohelp.domo.com/Administer/Controlling_Access_in_Domo/Managing_Custom_Roles "Managing Custom Roles").


The following screenshot points out the most important parts of the **Store ManagerÂ**tab:


![appstore_2020_store_manager_tab.png](appstore_2020_store_manager_tab.png)

| Sort menu | Lets you choose a sort option for the appsÂ in the selectedÂ subtab.Â You can sort ascending or descending alphabetically or by ascending or descending date. |


App Details view
----------------


You can open the details view for anÂ app cardÂ in theÂ AppstoreÂ by clicking the appÂ OR byÂ selectingÂ ![gear_menu_icon.png](gear_menu_icon.png)Â **> View App Details**Â inÂ aÂ QuickStart app page in your Domo.Â 


The following screenshot points out the most important components of the app details view. Note that this screenshot is specific to a connector, so several of these options are connector-specific, such as the tabs and option buttons.


![appstore_2020_app_details.png](appstore_2020_app_details.png)Â Â 


You can learn about the components of the details viewÂ in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tabs | Let you change the view in the left-side pane to see different information about this app or connector. Details views for apps include only one tab,Â **Overview**, which includes a screenshot of the app and descriptive information. Details views for connectors (shown in the example) include three other tabsâ€”**DataSets**, which lists all of the DataSetsÂ you can pull into Domo using this connector;Â **FAQ**, which lists frequently asked questions about the connector; andÂ **Reviews**, in which you can see the average rating of the connector and rate it yourself if you want.Â  |
| Option buttons | Let you perform various actions related to this app or connector. Different options are available depending on whether the details view is for an app or a connector and which tab you are viewing it in.Â 
General options for apps include the following:
* **Get**. Deploys this app toÂ your DomoÂ instance.

Options for connectors include the following:
* **Get the Data**. Opens the "Create DataSet" page for this connector so you can configure it and pull data into Domo. For more information, see [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).
* **Get the Cards**. Lets you deploy cards for the Sample App for this connector, if one is available. This allows you to power up several prebuilt, live cards based on your own data, without having to configure advanced options. This is a great way to "preview" the connector to make sure it provides the data you want. If you choose this option, you are asked to select the desired account or input your account information if you haven't created an account for this connector yet.

Options for apps in theÂ **InstalledÂ**tab include the following:
* **Open**. Opens this app in your Domo instance.
* **Uninstall**. Uninstalls this app from your Domo instance.Â

Options for apps in theÂ **Store Manager**Â tab include the following:Â 
* **ApproveÂ**(**PendingÂ**tab only). Lets you approve this app for publication to Domo's Appstore.Â Approved apps are shown in theÂ **Live**Â tab.
* **DenyÂ**(**PendingÂ**tab only). Lets you deny publication of this app. Denied apps are shown in theÂ **Denied**Â tab.
* **TestÂ**(**Live**Â andÂ **Denied**Â tabs). Lets you run a test-deploy of the app.Â
* **Remove from Store** (**Live**Â tab only). Removes this app from the Appstore.Â
 |
| App information | Provides information about the app, such asÂ a description, usage requirements, last update,Â and license information.Â 
If you have installed this app, a status indicator also appears.Â This showsÂ the current state of thisÂ app. It contains anÂ **Edit** button. Click the button to open aÂ dialog where you can see other installed versions of the app and add new connections. Â Â  |
| Preview and Ratings tabs | Let you switch between the **Preview** and **Ratings** panes at the bottom of the window. **Preview** shows you a preview of this app. **Ratings** shows the average rating for the app. In addition, if you have installed this app, you can rate the app by clicking **Rate This app**. |
