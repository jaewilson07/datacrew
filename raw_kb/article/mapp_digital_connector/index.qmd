Mapp Digital (formerly known as BlueHornet Corp.)Â is a marketing automation SaaS company which develops automated marketing and demand generation software and services for marketers. Use Domoâ€™s Mapp Digital connector to compile reports on marketing statistics such as contacts, emails opened, website visits, subscribes and unsubscribes, and so on.Â To learn more aboutÂ Mapp Digital API, visit theirÂ website ([http://bh-ems-static-content.s3.amaz...tication1.html](http://bh-ems-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/mappapi/authentication1.html "http://bh-ems-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/mappapi/authentication1.html")).  


You connect to your Mapp Digital account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Mapp Digital connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites

To connect to your Mapp Digital account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* The API key for your Mapp Digital account

This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Mapp Digital Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").
