Intro
-----


LinkedIn is a professional social networking platform.Â The DomoÂ LinkedIn Connector integrates Domo withÂ LinkedIn to extract data from theÂ LinkedIn API. The connector provides access to company details, shared posts, share statistics, user profile information, and video analytics.Â To learn more about theÂ LinkedIn API, visit their site ([https://developer.linkedin.com](https://developer.linkedin.com "https://developer.linkedin.com")).


The LinkedIn connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking **Cloud App** in the toolbar at the top of the window.


Â
**Important:**Â Certain connectors require an API usage fee charged to you by the company, not Domo, depending on the customers' accounts with that company. Use of this connector may require an API usage fee.
You connect to yourÂ LinkedIn account in theÂ Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to theÂ LinkedIn connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editingÂ DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").

| **Primary Use Cases** | This connector is useful for measuring engagement from company updates and posts. |
| **Primary Metrics** | 
* Company shareÂ statistics
* Video analytics
 |
| **Primary Company Roles** | Marketing roles, especially those involving social engagement |
| **Average Implementation Time** | Less than 10 minutes |
| **Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)** | 2 |


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to yourÂ LinkedIn account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* The email address you use to log in to LinkedIn
* The password you use to log in to LinkedIn


Connecting to YourÂ LinkedIn Account
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in theÂ **Credentials**Â andÂ **Details**Â panes in theÂ LinkedIn Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page,Â **Scheduling**Â andÂ **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


The DomoÂ LinkedIn connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. ClickÂ **ConnectÂ**(or selectÂ **Add Account**Â ifÂ you haveÂ existingÂ LinkedIn accounts in Domo)Â to open theÂ LinkedIn OAuth screen where you can enter the email address and password you use to log in to LinkedIn. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a newÂ LinkedIn DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in theÂ **Accounts**Â tab in theÂ Data Center. For more information about this tab, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports** menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Select the LinkedIn report you want to run. The following reports are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Get Basic Share Statistics | This report returns basic statistics for a selected number of the company's shares. This includes text, image, and video shares. |
| Get Company Details | This report returns company details for the selected company/organization id. |
| Get Company Followers Statistics | This report returns statistics about the people that are following the selected company/organization id. |
| Get Company Network Size | This report returns the number of first-degree connections the selected organization has. |
| Get Company Shares | This report returns information about the posts that a company has shared. |
| Get Company Share Statistics (Aggregated) | This report returns aggregated data across the company's shares. |
| Get Company Share Statistics (Individual) | This report returns data for a selected number of the company's shares, broken down by individual share. Note: This report does not include video shares. |
| Get Profile | This report returns the authenticated member's profile. |
| Get Organization Brand Page Statistics | This report returns statistics about an organization brand either as a lifetime or date range bound report. |
| Get Organization Page Statistics | This report returns statistics about an organization either as a lifetime or date range bound report. |
| Get Video Analytics | This report returns analytics data for video posts. |

 |
| OrganizationÂ ID | Select the organizationÂ you want to retrieve data for.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Post URN type selection | Specify whether you want to retrieve data for a specific type of post or for each type of post. |

 |
| Number of shares to retrieve | Enter the number of shares to be in the report. Up to the specified number, the most recent shares will be returned. |
| Reporting Timeframe | Select whether you want to retrieve data for all time (**Retrieve Lifetime Data**) or for a specified time period. |
| Breakdown | Select how the data will be broken down. |
| Skip invalid activity IDs | Check this box if you would like to ignore API failures when requesting activity IDs and continue instead of allowing the entire dataset to fail. |
| Sub report | Select the sub report object to be returned. |
| Granularity | Select whether you want the data in your report to be broken down by day or by month. |
| Duration | Specify whether the data in this report is for a single date or a range of dates. |
| Report DateÂ  | Specify whether theÂ data is for a specificÂ or relative date.Â ChooseÂ **Relative** if you always want the report toÂ retrieve data for aÂ given number of days back (which you specify in **Date Offset**) from the current date. For example, if you enterÂ 5 for **Date Offset** and set theÂ DataSet to updateÂ daily, eachÂ new day the report will update to show information for the date 5 days in the past. Â Â  |
| Date OffsetÂ  | Enter the number of days back from the current date that will be presented in the report.Â Â Â  |
| Date FromÂ  | Specify whether theÂ first date in your date range is a specific or relative date. ChooseÂ **Relative** if you always want the report to retrieve data for a given number of days back (which you specify inÂ **Date From Offset**) from the current date.Â If you choose **Relative here**, you should also choose **Relative** for **Date To** and specifyÂ a value forÂ **Date To Offset**.Â 
For example, if you enterÂ 10Â forÂ **Date From Offset** andÂ 5 forÂ **Date To Offset**Â and you set theÂ DataSet to updateÂ daily, each new day the report will update to show information for 5 to 10 days in the past. Â Â  |
| Date ToÂ  | Specify whether theÂ end date in your date range is a specific or relative date. ChooseÂ **Relative** if you always want the report to retrieve data for a given number of days backÂ (which you specify inÂ **Date To Offset**) from the current date. If you chooseÂ Relative here, you should also chooseÂ **Relative** forÂ **Date From** and specify a value forÂ **Date From Offset**.Â 
For example, if you enterÂ 10 forÂ **Date From Offset** andÂ 5 forÂ **Date To Offset** and you set theÂ DataSet to update daily, each new day the report will update to show information for 5 to 10 days in the past.Â  |
| Select Specific Date FromÂ  | Select the first date in your date range. Â  |
| Select Specific Date ToÂ  | Select the last date in your date range. Â  |
| Select Specific DateÂ  | Select the date you want to retrieveÂ data for. Â  |


### Other Panes


For information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, seeÂ [AddingÂ a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Troubleshooting
---------------



* The LinkedIn userÂ account used to create the DataSet *must* have access to a Company page. OtherwiseÂ the connector will not be able to pull any data.
* LinkedIn access tokens stay valid until the number of seconds returned in the expires\_in field in the API response.Â Currently, all access tokens are issued with a 60-day lifespan.
