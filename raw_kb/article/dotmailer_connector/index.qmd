Intro
-----


dotmailer is a scalable email marketing and marketing automation solution. To learn more about the dotmailer API, visit their page ([https://developer.dotmailer.com/](https://developer.dotmailer.com/ "https://developer.dotmailer.com/")).  


You connect to your dotmailer account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the dotmailer connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your dotmailer account and create a DataSet, you must have a dotmailer username and password.


Connecting to Your dotmailer Account
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the dotmailer Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your dotmailer account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the username for your dotmailer account. |
| Password | Enter the password for your dotmailer account. |


Once you have entered valid dotmailer credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new dotmailer DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
