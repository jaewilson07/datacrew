Intro
-----


The File Upload Connector allows you to easily bring your important spreadsheet files into Domo and begin making decisions faster. Regardless of the file type you choose (CSV, XLS, or XLSX), there are a wide range of configuration options to meet your custom file needs.


As of our February 2018 release, there are two versions of the File Upload connector available in Domo: 



* The newer—and recommended—version of the connector provides an intuitive workflow to make even the most complicated Excel or CSV files usable within Domo. It lets you maintain all of the organization and configuration of your custom Excel or CSV files and still have usable data within Domo. Requiring virtually no input, this version does the heavy lifting for you.
* The legacy version of this connector is also still available. This version requires you to configure a number of advanced settings (most of which are set for you automatically when using the new version of the connector).


You can begin the process of creating a File Upload DataSet in one of several different ways:



* By going into the Data Center and choosing the **File** option from the toolbar at the top of the screen.
* By clicking the ![add_pages_icon.png](add_pages_icon.png)icon in the upper right corner of the **Dashboards** tab, selecting **Create new Card**, selecting **Visualization**, then clicking **Upload**.
* By clicking ![add_to_domo_icon.png](add_to_domo_icon.png) in the upper right corner of the screen from anywhere in Domo, selecting **Card**, selecting **Visualization**, then clicking **Upload**.


This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the File Upload connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.qmd).

Prerequisites
-------------


If you are connecting to an Excel file that is password-protected, you will need to know the password. Otherwise, no credentials are required to use either version of this connector. 


Using the new ("wizard") File Upload connector
----------------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the File Upload wizard. The components of the other pane in this page, **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.qmd "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### "Upload spreadsheet" screen


In the first page of the File Upload connector wizard, you simply drag and drop an XLS, XLSX, or CSV file from your computer into the box or select the desired file from your computer. Once you've dragged or selected your file, the next pane in the wizard opens automatically.


### "Select tables" screen


This screen displays a preview of the selected file and provides options for selecting and formatting the data. Options for configuring the file may appear depending on the file type (Excel or CSV) and properties (such as whether your Excel file is password-protected).


### Options for Excel files


#### Data selection


By default, when the **Select Tables**screen opens for an Excel spreadsheet, all of the cells in Row 1 of your spreadsheet are considered column headers, indicated by dark blue highlighting, and the rest of the data in the spreadsheet is considered to be your selected "body" data, indicated by light blue highlighting. This means that if you were to create a DataSet from this data, all of the data would be imported into the DataSet, with the Row 1 cells acting as the column headers. This is also reflected in the **Column Headers** and **Selection** fields under "Data Grid," in which **Column Headers** shows the coordinates for the first and last cells in the first row, and **Selection** shows the coordinates for the first and last cells in the body.


The following screenshot shows an example of this initial selection. Note that the column header cells in the preview appear unselected (as these are considered separate from the "body" of the spreadsheet). Also note that the **Column Headers** fields in the bottom left read "A1" to "G1" and the **Selection** fields read "A2" to "G51" (which are the first and last selected cells in the body). 


![file_upload_selection_2020.png](file_upload_selection_2020.png)   


If a user then selects a different block of data by mousing over it, the **Selection** fields update to reflect this. Note that the **Column Headers** fields are *not* updated. If you want to update the selected column headers, you can do so by either...



* setting the coordinates manually in the **Column Headers** fields, or
* clicking within either **Column Headers** field *then* clicking and dragging over the desired column headers in the preview.


This latter concept is very important. If you click anywhere in the **Column Headers** fields, any cells you select in the preview are considered to be column headers (and the coordinates in the **Column Headers** fields will update) whereas if you click in the **Selection** fields, all cells you select in the preview are considered to be "body" data (and the coordinates in the **Selection** fields will update). In other words, you can toggle the "active" selection method by clicking in the field that corresponds to that selection method.      


In the following screenshot, the user highlights cell "A2" to cell "E10." By default, the **Selection** toggle is active, so these cells are considered to be body cells, and the **Selection** fields update to reflect the change.   
  
![file_upload_selection2_2020.png](file_upload_selection2_2020.png)


But, if the user clicks in either **Column Headers** cell, then that toggle becomes active. The user then selects the top two rows of data in the preview, and the change is reflected in the **Column Headers** fields.


![file_upload_selection3.png](file_upload_selection3.png)


**Note:** The Large File Upload Connector discards any empty rows appearing before the table in an XLSX file. So, if the XLSX file has 1 blank row prior to the table, decrease the Column Headers and Selection by 1 row.
Consider the following example:


To select the range A3:C6, enter Column Headers as A2:C2 and Selection as A3:C5 as there is an empty row before the table. ![File_upload.png](File_upload.png)


#### Format


As mentioned above, by default all Excel spreadsheets brought into Domo are assumed to have column headers instead of row headers or a cross-tab (pivot) layout. If this is not the case for your data, you can select the correct format in the **Format**menu. For more information about the different kinds of data layouts, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.qmd "Understanding Chart Data").


#### Sheet selection


If your Excel file consists of more than one sheet, you can select the desired sheet in the menu just above the preview. 


![file_upload_sheet_menu.png](file_upload_sheet_menu.png)


#### Generating headers


If you check the **Generate Headers** box, a row (or column, if you have selected **Row Headers**) of headers is automatically generated with generic names such as "\_Column\_1," "\_Column\_2," etc. 


If your spreadsheet is missing any column or row headers, these will be generated automatically when you click **Preview**. For example, in the following screenshot, a header was missing in the fourth column, so the header "\_COLUMN\_4" was generated automatically. 


![file_upload_missing_header.png](file_upload_missing_header.png)


#### Keep Leading Zeroes


Select this checkbox if you want to keep leading zeros in numeric values like '0123'. 


**Note**: The connector will parse the values with leading zeroes as text.


### Options for CSV files


#### Data selection


All data from a CSV file is imported into a DataSet when you build it, even if you click and drag to highlight a specific portion.   


#### Generating headers


By default, the top row in your CSV sheet is considered to be the header row. You can automatically generate a new header row with generic names such as "\_COLUMN\_1," "\_COLUMN\_2," etc. by checking the **Generate headers** box.


#### File encoding


By default, UTF-8 encoding is used for your CSV file. If desired you can select a different encoding type in the **File Encoding** menu.


#### Delimiter


By default, a comma is used as the delimiter for your CSV file. If desired you can select a different delimiter in the **Delimiter** menu.


Using the legacy File Upload connector
--------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in **Details** and **Advanced** panes in the File Upload Connector page. The components of the other pane in this page, **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are discussed in greater length in [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.qmd "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").

FAQs
----


##### What is the file size limit for this connector?


The File Upload connector can handle files up to 250 MB. If you need to import a file larger than 250 MB, consider using the [Excel SFTP](..\microsoft_excel_sftp_connector\index.qmd "CSV-SFTP Connector") connectors. 


##### Why am I getting an error saying my file is not supported?


The file you are trying to upload contains features not currently supported by the connector. Try using the File Upload Legacy connector instead.


##### How can I easily update an existing File Upload DataSet?


You can update a File Upload DataSet by doing the following:


1. Navigate to the DataSet in the Data Center.
2. Open the **Settings** tab for the DataSet.
3. Upload the new version of the file using the **Upload**field.


The DataSet will be replaced with the new version of the file, and any Cards built off of the DataSet will automatically update.
