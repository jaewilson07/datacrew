Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to yourÂ App AnnieÂ account and create a DataSet, you must have the email address you use to log into App Annie, as well as your App Annie password.


Connecting to Your App Annie Account
------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the App Annie Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


The Domo App Annie connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. ClickÂ **Connect**Â (or selectÂ **Add Account**Â ifÂ you haveÂ existing App Annie accounts in Domo) to open the App Annie OAuth screen where you can enter your App Annie credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new App Annie DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in theÂ **Accounts**Â tab in theÂ Data Center. For more information about this tab, seeÂ [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


**Note:**Â If you are already logged into App Annie when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click **Add account**. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Facebook or switch accounts (using the **Switch Accounts** option in the OAuth screen).
### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.

| Select Specific DateÂ  | Select the date for the report.Â  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of days back you want to retrieve data for. For example,Â 0 would return today's data;Â 1 or yesterdayÂ would retrieve yesterday's data;Â 7 orÂ today-7 would retrieve data for the past 7 days; and so on. |
| Start Date | Specify whether theÂ first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.Â You select the last date in your range inÂ **End Date**.Â  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range inÂ **Start Date**.Â Â  |
| Select Specific Start Date | SelectÂ the first date in your date range.Â  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.Â  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to End At**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
| Number of Days Back for Historical Data on First Run | Enter the number of past days to backfill on the first run of the DataSet. |
