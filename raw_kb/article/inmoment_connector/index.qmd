Intro
-----


InMoment is a cloud-based customer experience optimization platform that gives you the ability to listen to and engage with your customers to improve business results through better experiences. Use Domo'sÂ InMomentÂ connector to retrieve survey answers, scores, tags, and more. To learn more about the InMomentÂ API, visit their page ([http://www.inmoment.com/solutions/](http://www.inmoment.com/solutions/ "http://www.inmoment.com/solutions/")).


You connect to your InMoment account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the InMoment connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your InMoment account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* The username and password for your InMoment account.
* Your InMoment client ID generated when you created the application.
* Your InMoment client secret when you created the application.


Connecting to Your InMoment Account
-----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the InMoment Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your InMoment account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â

| Client ID | Enter your InMoment client ID. |
| Client Secret | Enter your InMoment client secret. |
| Username | Enter the username for your InMoment account. |
| Password | Enter the password for your InMomentÂ account. |


Once you have entered valid InMoment credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new InMoment DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
