Intro
-----


Bronto Software is a commerce marketing automation provider, enabling retailers to drive revenue through their email, mobile and social campaigns. Use Domo'sÂ  Bronto connector to retrieve data about contacts, messages, deliveries, and so on. To learn more about the Bronto API, visit their page ([http://dev.bronto.com/api/](http://dev.bronto.com/api/ "http://dev.bronto.com/api/")).


You connect to your Bronto account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Bronto connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).  


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Bronto account and create a DataSet, you must have a Bronto API token. For information about obtaining an API token, visit [http://dev.bronto.com/gettingstarted...ccess-the-api/](http://dev.bronto.com/gettingstarted/soap-how-to-get-started/how-to-access-the-api/ "http://dev.bronto.com/gettingstarted/soap-how-to-get-started/how-to-access-the-api/").


Connecting to Your Bronto Account
---------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Bronto Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Bronto account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API Token | Enter your Bronto API token. For information about obtaining a token, see [http://dev.bronto.com/gettingstarted...ccess-the-api/](http://dev.bronto.com/gettingstarted/soap-how-to-get-started/how-to-access-the-api/ "http://dev.bronto.com/gettingstarted/soap-how-to-get-started/how-to-access-the-api/") |


Once you have entered a valid API token and created an account, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Bronto DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
