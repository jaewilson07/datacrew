Intro
-----


RevContent is a content recommendation network with widgets that can be integrated with all types of blogs and websites to enhance traffic and increase revenue. To learn more about the RevContent API, visit their page ([https://api.revcontent.io/docs/stats/](https://api.revcontent.io/docs/stats/ "https://api.revcontent.io/docs/stats/")).  


You connect to your RevContent account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the RevContent connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your RevContent account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* A RevContent client ID
* A RevContent client secret


For information about obtaining these credentials, see [https://faq.revcontent.com/customer/...rs-publishers-](https://faq.revcontent.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2702263-stats-api-documentation-and-setup-advertisers-publishers- "https://faq.revcontent.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2702263-stats-api-documentation-and-setup-advertisers-publishers-").


Connecting to Your RevContent Account
-------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the RevContent Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your RevContent account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:Â  




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | Enter your RevContent client ID. |
| Client Secret | Enter your RevContent client secret. |


Once you have entered valid RevContent credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new RevContent DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
