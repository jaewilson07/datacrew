Intro
-----


The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is a U.S. government agency that provides official macroeconomic and industry statistics including the gross domestic product of the United States. Â To learn more about the BEA API, visit their page ([https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm](https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm "https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm")).  


You connect to your BEA account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BEA connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your BEA account and create a DataSet, you must have a BEA API key. This API key is provided to you by email after you register atÂ [https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm](https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm "https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm").Â 


Connecting to Your BEA Account
------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the BEA Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your BEA account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API Key | Enter your BEA API key.Â This API key is provided to you by email after you register atÂ [https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm](https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm "https://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm").Â  |


Once you have entered valid BEA credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new BEA DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").
