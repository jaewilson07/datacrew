Intro
-----


Date SelectorÂ Cards display a calendar-style range of dates. When you add themÂ to a Card Page in Domo, users visiting that Page can select a range of dates from the calendar as a filter. Alternatively, they can choose from a number of preset date filters such as "Last year," "Last 2 months," etc. The date filter you choose is applied to all other Cards on the Page. For example, if you selected all dates from April 1st to July 31st on the calendar, all other Cards in the Page would be filtered to show just the data for these dates.Â All Date Selector Cards have a 25,000 row limit.

Powering Date Selector Cards
----------------------------


This type of graph requires two columns or rows of data from your DataSet. One of these contains aÂ date column. You drop this column into the "Date" field in Analyzer.  
Â

Â 


The other field is called "Group By." Though this field is required to power up the Card, in general it doesn't matter what column you drop here. If you need to aggregate the data, you can use this column to do so. For example, if the date column is duplicated in your DataSet, you can make the dates unique by aggregating.Â 


For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


Customizing Date Selector Cards
-------------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a Date Selector CardÂ by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties"). Unique properties of Date Selector Cards include the following:Â

| General > View | Determines the calendar view that is used. The following options are available:
