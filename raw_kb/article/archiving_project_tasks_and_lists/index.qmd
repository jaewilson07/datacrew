In the Details page for a project, you can archive a task, an entire list, or all of the tasks from a list (in which case the list itself remains in your Details page but the tasks are archived). Archived tasks and lists can be "unarchived," or restored to their original locations. Archiving provides a way of "cleaning up" your project page by removing completed or deferred tasks or unnecessary lists while making it possible to view or retrieve those tasks or lists whenever you need to.


You can only archive tasks and lists from projects you are assigned to, unless you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Projects and Tasks" enabled. For more information about default security roles, seeÂ [Managing Custom Roles](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Default Security Role Reference").


**To archive a task,**


1. Open theÂ Projects & TasksÂ page by selectingÂ **Projects and Tasks**Â in theÂ **More** menu at the top of the screen.
2. Click the name of the project with tasks you want to archive.
3. Click the task you want to archive.  
 The Edit dialog for this task appears.
4. ClickÂ **Archive**.


The task is sent to the archives.


**To archive a list or all the tasks from a list,**


1. Open theÂ Projects & TasksÂ page by selectingÂ **Projects and Tasks**Â in theÂ **More**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ menu at the top of the screen.
2. Click the name of the project with tasks or lists you want to archive.
3. Mouse over the top right corner of the list then mouse over the arrow that appears.
4. Do one of the following:


	1. To archive the entire list, clickÂ **Archive List**.
	2. To archive the tasks from a list but not the list itself, clickÂ **Archive All Tasks** in List.


The list or tasks is/are sent to the archives.


**To unarchive individual tasks or an entire list,**


1. Open theÂ Projects & TasksÂ page by selectingÂ **Projects and Tasks**Â in theÂ **More**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ menu at the top of the screen.
2. Click the name of the project with tasks or lists you want to unarchive.
3. Mouse over the arrow to the right of the project name then selectÂ **View Archives**.  
 The archived lists and tasks for this project appear.
4. Do one of the following:


	1. To unarchive a task, click theÂ **Unarchive**Â link on the task card.
	2. To unarchive a list, click theÂ **Unarchive**Â button at the bottom of the list.


The following screenshot points out the controls for unarchiving a task and a list.
