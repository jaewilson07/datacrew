**Note:** Depending on the product version you are using, the documentation may include information about features that may not be available or may have changed.
New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Clean Column Names in DataFusions


In previous versions of DataFusions, all column names were prepended with the name of the DataSet. These names were often very long, soÂ users often had a difficult timeÂ attempting to apply these columns in Card Builder and filters. Now,Â column names are prepended with the DataSet name *only*Â when required because the names are duplicated.Â Otherwise, the column names are left as is.Â 


For more information, seeÂ [Combining DataSets Using DataFusion](..\combining_datasets_using_datafusion\index.html "Combining DataSets Using DataFusion"). Â Â 


### Heat Map Improvements


You can now specify colors for rangesÂ in Heat Maps. By default, colors are based on the theme you select in **Chart Properties > Theme**, so until nowÂ you could only choose a single color with different hues. Now you can choose different colors for each individual range.Â

You can also filter on individual items in the Details view for aÂ Heat Map by clicking the scale labels. For example, clicking "Human Resources" in the card in the previous screenshot would show the data filtered for Human Resources.Â 


For more information about Heat Maps, seeÂ [Heat Map](..\heat_map\index.html "Heat Map").Â 


### End of Support for Workbench 2


Beginning in September,Â Domo will be ending support for Workbench 2.


### End of Support for IE9


Beginning with our July release, Domo will no longer be supporting Internet Explorer 9.Â
