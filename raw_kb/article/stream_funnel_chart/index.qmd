Intro
-----


A Stream Funnel chart is cross between a Funnel chart and a [Stacked Area chart](..\stacked_area_chart\index.html "Stacked Area Graph"). Unlike other pie-type charts in Domo, Stream Funnel charts allow you to include series data (though this is not required). Legends are not shown in a Stream Funnel chart unless series data is included. Stream Funnel charts also do not show value data except upon mouse-over. Therefore they are most effective for showing relative differences between stages rather than representing exact amounts.


This chart type is exactly the same as a [Stream chart](..\stream_chart\index.html "Stream Graph") (classified in the Chart Picker as an Area chart rather than a pie-type chart) but is shown vertically rather than horizontally. Â 


The following example shows a Stream Funnel without series data:

Â 


Whereas the next example shows the same chart with series data applied:

Â 


Also unlike other types of Funnel charts, drill path is available in Stream Funnel charts. For more information about drilling, seeÂ [Adding Drill Path to Your Chart](..\adding_a_drill_path_to_your_chart\index.html "Adding Drill Path to Your Chart").


Powering Stream Funnel Charts
-----------------------------


Stream Funnel charts require two columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”a category column or row containing the names of each stage, and a value column or row containing the corresponding values for each stage. You can also add a column containing series data if you want. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer,Â you choose the columns containing the data for your Stream Funnel chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer").


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category, value, and series columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Stream Funnel chart:

Customizing Stream Funnel Charts
--------------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a Stream Funnel chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
