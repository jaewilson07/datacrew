Intro
-----


A risk heat map is a special type of heat map you can use to present the results of a risk assessment process visually Â Whether conducted as part of a broad-based enterprise risk management process or more narrowly focused internal control process, risk assessment is a critical step in risk management. The risk heat map makes this easy to see and discover risk.

Powering Risk Heat Maps
-----------------------


The risk heat map requires two categories and one value column. The categories usually represent the severity and likelihood of an event.Â 


For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.md).


In Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your risk heat map. For more information about choosing data columns, see [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.md).


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.md).


Customizing Risk Heat Maps
