Intro
-----


SpringServeÂ provides a suite of ad serving tools designed to make digital advertising more efficient. Use Domo's SpringServe connector to retrieve lists of SpringServeÂ groups, partners, tags, and domains. To learn more about the SpringServe API, visit their page ([https://wiki.springserve.com/display/SSD/Reporting+API](https://wiki.springserve.com/display/SSD/Reporting+API "https://springserve.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SSD/pages/15826974/Reporting+API")).


You connect to your SpringServe account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SpringServe connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md).


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your SpringServe account and create a DataSet, you must have a SpringServe username and password.


Connecting to Your SpringServe Account
--------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the SpringServe Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.md "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your SpringServe account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter your SpringServe username. |
| Password | Enter your SpringServe password. |


Once you have entered valid SpringServe credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new SpringServe DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.
