You can configure Workbench to allow users to be notified via email when aÂ DataSet job is completed, either successfully or unsuccessfully. You do this in theÂ **Notifications** subtab for a given DataSet job.Â ThisÂ lists all of the users on your Domo server with their roles and the email addresses to which notifications will be sent. For each user,Â **Notify on Success** andÂ **Notify on Error** boxes are available. For any given user, you can select one box, both boxes, or leave both blank (in which case no notifications are sent).Â
