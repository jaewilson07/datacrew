New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Buzz Updates


Based on your feedback, Buzz has been updated to include a number of improvements to facilitate your communication. These improvements include...



* **Ability to edit messages**. Edit mistakes out of your messages after you have posted them.

* **Mention filter that sorts based on category**. @-mentioning in Buzz now filters based on category to allow you to more easily navigate to that card or group you are looking for.  
   
 ![](1.png)
* **Display who is online**. Just like in your old DomoBuzz, you can see who in your organization is logged into Domo. For more information, seeÂ [Seeing Online Users in Domo](..\seeing_online_users_in_domo\index.html "Seeing Online Users in Domo").

* **Ability to collapse attachments**. Hide attachments and GIFs that may be distracting you.

### Hybrid SSO


Hybrid SSO allows users with Single Sign-On enabled to specify which of their users can log in directly to Domo. 


Previously, hybrid SSO was available only to Administrators using a feature switch. For SSO customers trying to grant Domo access to contractors or non-employees, this often created a dilemma because such users were not usually given accounts in the companyâ€™s email or directory system. Now, however, Admins can go into the **Single Sign-On** tab in the Admin Settings and specify a set of users who are able to sign into Domo directly, just as they would without SSO enabled. Users can then toggle login modes (Direct or Single Sign-on) from the Domo login screen.

For more information, see [Adding Users to Direct Sign-On](..\understanding_and_configuring_domo_single_signon_using_saml\index.html "Understanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On").


### App Deploy Improvements


For this release we are pushing the following improvements to our App deploy process:



* Support for multi-connector content.Â  Apps can now be powered by 1:n connectors, providing a simple-to-understand interface.
* Multi-user deploy capability. With more complicated Apps, itâ€™s unlikely a single person has all the credentials needed to be successful.Â  Weâ€™ve leveraged Buzz and added the ability to collaborate in the power-up process. You can assign specific portions to the right person.Â  This effectively removes the need for sticky notes and other uncomfortable requests for credentials.


### Updated UI for Google Analytics Connector


The user interface for the Google Analytics connector now offers a more intuitive, step-by-step workflow. Instead of providing a single pane for selecting parameters and report types, the new interface divides up options between five panesâ€”**Select Views**, **Select Reports**, **Select Segments**, **Select Duration**, and **Test My Configuration**.


The following screenshot shows the new view for selecting Google Analytics reports in Domo:

Page and Card Analyzer Filter Search Box
----------------------------------------


When you add a filter to a page or card, you can now more easily find the columns you're looking for using a new search box.
