Intro
-----


Candlestick charts are used to represent rises and falls in stock values. These charts are similar toÂ [high-low charts](..\highlow_chart\index.html "High Low Graph")Â but are more complex, requiring two additional columns. For any given category, a graphic is shown consisting of a box with lines protruding from the top and bottom, hence the name "candlestick." As in a high-low chart, the ends of the lines represent the high and low prices for the stock respectively. The top and bottom boundaries of the box represent the opening and closing prices of the stock. If the opening price of the stock isÂ *lower*Â than the closing price (that is, the stock gained value), the graphic appears green. If the opening price isÂ *higher*Â than the closing price (that is, the stock decreased in value), the graphic appears red.


Powering candlestick charts
---------------------------


Candlestick charts require five columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”a category column or row containing the name of each stock or the dates if you are showing a time progression for a single stock; and four columns or rows with the values. One of the columns or rows contains low values for the stocks or dates; one contains closing values; one contains opening values; and one contains high values. For information about value, category, and series data, seeÂ [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your candlestick chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a candlestick chart:
