New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)


Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)Â allow you to create a customized experience for each Domo user through the definition of Entitlement Policies. UsingÂ Entitlement Policies, you canÂ filter data in a DataSet for specified users and/or groups. PDP policies are applied almost anywhere in DomoÂ that data from this DataSetÂ is used, including the following:



* Cards. If a card is powered by a DataSetÂ with PDP policies applied, affected users and groups see only data in the card that applies to them.
* Alerts. An alert's PDP policies filter the alert data and control which users can subscribe.
* DataFusions. When you add input DataSetsÂ with PDP policies applied to a DataFusion, only the data allowed by the policy is incorporated into the DataFusion.


You cannot add input DataSetsÂ to a DataFlowÂ if you are restricted by PDP policies; however, you can add policies to the output DataSetsÂ generated by the DataFlow. When executing a DataFlowÂ with PDP policies applied, youÂ *must*Â have an "Admin" security role or be the DataFlow owner; otherwise the DataFlow will break.Â Â Â Â 


If no Entitlement Policies have been created for a DataSet, anyone theÂ DataSet has been shared with will have full access to the data. If a policy is created, only those users in the policy can see data.

### DesignÂ Studio updates


The following enhancements have been made to the Design Studio:



* Notifications for users with older versions. Creative Cloud syncs version updates to users, so if users have turned off the Creative Cloud desktop sync application or if they need IT permission to upgrade, their version of Design Studio may be out of date. To accommodate this problem, a notification system has been built to identify users with older versions and instruct them on how to upgrade.Â
* New font selection interface. The former interface required users to type the font name into a text field. This has now been changed to a drop-down menu that populates with supported web fonts.

	 ![](3.png)
	+ Image and text link widgets that allow you to link to URLs on Domo's whitelist.Â   
	   
	 ![](4.png)
	+ Table Widget V2. The new table widget allows you to add sorts;Â define width by pixels or points;Â have alternating row colors;Â and set background transparency, cell borders, and border size.
