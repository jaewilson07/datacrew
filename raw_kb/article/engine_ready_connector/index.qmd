Engine Ready provides custom online marketing solutions for businesses and is an industry leader in SEO and PPC. You connect to your Engine Ready account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Engine Ready connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").

To connect to your Engine Ready account and create a DataSet, you must have your Engine Ready username and password.
