New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Domo Stories enhancements


Domo Stories Dashboards are now enhanced with Drill Paths, summary metrics, and background colors for even more control over the presentation of your data.


#### Drill in Place


Drill PathsÂ are now available from Pages, so you don'tÂ have to leave your DashboardÂ to drill into a Card. Deep-dive on a single Card while maintaining the context of the other Cards on a Page, or apply Dashboard filters to change the view as you drill.


To enable Drill Paths on Dashboards, selectÂ **Edit Content > Change interactionÂ**for the Card, then choose theÂ **Drill in place**Â radio button.Â You must be inÂ **Edit Dashboard**Â mode for these options to be available.Â

For more information, seeÂ [Creating Domo Stories](..\creating_domo_stories\index.html "Creating Domo Stories").


#### Dashboard background colors


Customize your Dashboards with background colors to match any branding or theme. Choose colors from a palette or use hexadecimal values to personalize.Â

For more information, seeÂ [Creating Domo Stories](..\creating_domo_stories\index.html "Creating Domo Stories").


#### Summary metric view


The new summary metric view allows you to toggle charts on and off using the **Display settings** option in Domo Stories. This creates a formatted Summary Number so you can leverage existing content in the context that works best for your Domo Story.


For more information, seeÂ [Creating Domo Stories](..\creating_domo_stories\index.html "Creating Domo Stories").


### Improved DataSet picker


Use the new DataSet picker to search for DataSets with any filter criteria, like tags, certification state, row count, Card count, last execution time, execution status, and more. You can also sort your results for easier discovery.

For more information, seeÂ [Powering a KPI Card with Data](..\powering_a_visualization_card_with_data\index.html "Powering a KPI Card with Data").


### Enhanced Dashboard FiltersÂ


Enhanced Dashboard Filters bring more clarity and context to Page filtering. Instead of choosing a DataSet to filter on, you can choose your filter columns from a list of all available columns used in Cards on the Page. Summary text on each Page appears whenever filters are applied, so you quickly see which filters are applied. Plus, Beast Mode calculations shared on a DataSet will now appear in the Dashboard Filter list.

For more information, seeÂ [Applying Page-Level Filters](/s/article/360042923894 "Applying Page-Level Filters").


### Enhanced Analyzer Card FiltersÂ


Configure filters for Cards faster than ever before with enhanced Analyzer filters. With the new filtering improvements, you can:



* Filter on values containing specific wordsÂ without having to create Beast Mode LIKE functions.
* Change the date type for a column without having to open a DataFlow.
* Choose specific dates and numbers to filter on rather than indicating a range.Â
