Intro
-----


You can create and assign tasks in any project for which you have access. When you assign a task to a user, that user receives a notification of the assignment in theÂ Buzz feed for this project, as well as via email/SMS.


There are several ways to do this, including the following:



* Entering a task directly in the box at the bottom of the desired task list in the project details page.
* Clicking theÂ **Assign Task**Â button in the project details page and filling out the details of the task in the dialog.
* Clicking a user's profile picture, clickingÂ **Assign Task**, and specifying the task details in the dialog.
* Entering a task in Buzz, selectingÂ **Create Task**Â from the ...Â menu, when you hover over a message, and specifying the task details in the dialog.


**Notes**:Â 




	+ You can *only* assign tasks in projects of which you are a team member (unless you have an "Admin" [custom role](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Default Security Role Reference") with "Manage All Projects and Tasks" enabled). A user does *not* already need to be a team member for the current project to receive a task assignment in that project.Â
	+ You can assign a task to anyone in your company with a Domo account. If you do assign a task to a non-team member, they are added as a new team member for this project.
	+ You can assign tasks to others while in your "Personal Tasks" project. If you do not choose a different project, these tasks do not remain in your "Personal Tasks," but are sent to the "To Do" list in the assignee's "Personal Tasks" project.

Entering a Task Directly into a Task List
-----------------------------------------


When you create a task by entering it directly into theÂ **Add a task**Â box in the project task list, you are automatically assigned as the task owner.


![](0.png)


**To enter a task into a list,**


1. Open theÂ Projects & TasksÂ page by selectingÂ **Projects and Tasks**Â in theÂ **More** menu at the top of the screen.
2. Click the name of the project you want to edit.
3. Type the task into theÂ **Add a task**Â box in the desired list.
4. Press Enter.


The task appears in the workflow where you entered it.


When you create a task in this way, you are automatically assigned as the task owner and the first contributor. The *owner*Â of a task is intended to be the person accountable for the task completion and can be the point person for decision-making and clarification. *ContributorsÂ*are any people besides the owner who are involved with the task andÂ need visibility.Â 


If you want, you can change the owner and contributors of a task in the task edit dialog. You change the owner by clicking theÂ **Change**Â link in theÂ **Owner**Â field and selecting a new owner. You change and add new contributors in theÂ **Contributors**Â field.Â 


![task_owner_and_contributors.png](task_owner_and_contributors.png)


**Note:** You can only enter the name of a user you want to add in the Activity Area of Projects and Tasks. Groups can not be added to the Activity Area. For more information about Buzz, see [Chatting in Buzz](..\chatting_in_buzz\index.md).
**To change the owner and/or contributorsÂ assigned to a workflow task,**


1. Click the task.  
The dialog for editing the task appears.
2. Do anyÂ of the following:



	* Change the task owner by clicking theÂ **Change**Â link next to the name of the current owner then entering the name of the new owner.
	* Remove contributors no longer assigned to the task by clicking the "x" to the right of the name in theÂ **ContributorsÂ**field.
	* Add new contributors by clicking in the empty space in theÂ **Contributors**Â field then selecting the name of the new contributor.Â   
	When you select a name, it is added to the field. You can assign as many contributors to a task as you want.
3. ClickÂ **Save**.  
For information on the other options in this dialog, seeÂ [Editing Project Tasks](..\editing_project_tasks\index.html "Editing Project Tasks").


Creating a Task Using the Assign Task button
--------------------------------------------


When you create a task using theÂ **Assign Task**Â button, you can change the owner and contributor(s) during the task creation process (you are automatically assigned to both by default). Tasks you create in this way areÂ sent to the first list for this project (or whichever project you choose, if you select a different project).Â
