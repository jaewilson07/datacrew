**Important:**Â DemandsphereÂ has changed the name ofÂ GinzaMetrics to DemandMetrics. DemandMetrics is still your one-stop-shop for SEO, content, and competitor analytics. There should be no change to the Login User ID, Password, API Key, or Site Key.Â
Intro
-----


DemandMetrics is a business intelligence and SEO platform designed to help businesses determine, design and implement changes and improvements to their site structure. Use Domo's DemandMetrics connector to manage and retrieve search rankings, optimization recommendations, social signals and web analytics data. To learn more about the DemandMetricsÂ API, visit their page ([https://www.ginzametrics.com/api/api-documentation/](https://www.ginzametrics.com/api/api-documentation/ "https://www.ginzametrics.com/api/api-documentation/")).


You connect to your DemandMetrics account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DemandMetrics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your DemandMetrics account and create a DataSet, you must have a DemandMetrics API key. If you do not have an API key, you can request one by emailing [support@ginzametrics.com](mailto:support@ginzametrics.com "mailto:support@ginzametrics.com").Â 


Connecting to Your DemandMetrics Account
----------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the DemandMetrics Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your DemandMetrics account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API Key | Enter your DemandMetrics API key.Â If you do not have an API key, you can request one by emailing [support@ginzametrics.com](mailto:support@ginzametrics.com "mailto:support@ginzametrics.com").Â  |


Once you have entered valid DemandMetrics credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new DemandMetrics DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.

| Competitors Ranking | Returns competitors' keyword rankings over time. |
| Integrated Keyword Performance | Returns statistics about keyword rankings for a given search engine.Â  |
| Keyword Ranking Trends | Returns information about your keyword rankings over time. |

 |
| Report Type | Select how your report data is to be broken down. If you selectÂ **Aggregate**, the data in the report is aggregated. If you selectÂ **Granular**, the data is broken down by the date grain you have selected in theÂ **Granular**Â menu. |
| Granularity | Select the date granularity for your report data. For example, if you selectÂ **Weekly**, the data will be broken down by week.Â  |
| Site Global Key | Enter the global key for the site you want to retrieve data for. |
| Search Engine Global Key | Enter the global key for the search engine you want to retrieve data for.Â  |
| DurationÂ  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.Â  |
| Report DateÂ  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.Â  |
| Select Specific DateÂ  | Select the date for the report.Â  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.Â Â  |
| Start Date | Specify whether theÂ first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.Â You select the last date in your range inÂ **End Date**.Â  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range inÂ **Start Date**.Â Â  |
| Select Specific Start Date | SelectÂ the first date in your date range.Â  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.Â  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to End At**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
