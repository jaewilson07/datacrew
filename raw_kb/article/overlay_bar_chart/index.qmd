Intro
-----


An Overlay Bar chart is similar to a standard [Stacked Bar chart](..\stacked_bar_chart\index.html "Stacked Bar Graph")Â except that instead of being stacked, all series items begin from the baseline, so overlapping of series items occurs in a category when multiple series are present. In its initial non-rollover state, an Overlay chart is rather meaningless, as shown in the following example:  
 Â

However, by mousing over a series item in the legend, you can see just that series in the chart, as shown in the following example:

In many applications this may be more useful than a Stacked Bar because you can more quickly compare series items in different categories. (In a Stacked Bar this is difficult because series in different categories do not usually begin from the same baseline.)


Overlay Bar charts include both vertical and horizontal sub-types.


Powering Overlay Bar charts
---------------------------


An Overlay Bar chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSetâ€”one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer,Â you choose the columns containing the data for your Overlay Bar chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.](..\analyzer_overview\index.md)


The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a vertical Overlay Bar chart:

The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a horizontal Overlay Bar chart:

Customizing Overlay Bar charts
------------------------------


You can customize the appearance of an Overlay Bar chart in a number of ways. Many customizations are possible by setting **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see [Chart Properties](..\applying_and_resetting_chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
