Intro
-----


After you configure routing, creation, and mapping in the publishing organization and choose your interface settings with Brand Kit, the next step is to publish or embedÂ your content so others can view it. This article describes how to set up a subscriber organization and publish content to it. To learn more about embedding, see [Sharing Cards and Dashboards Outside of Domo Using Domo Embed](..\sharing_content_outside_of_domo_with_embed\index.md).Â 


A subscriber organization can subscribe to publications individually, as invited, or auto-subscribe to receive all publications that come from a trusted publishing organization. For more information,Â see the headings for [Subscribe to a Publication](#subscribing_publication) or [Auto-Subscribe to all Publications from an Organization](#auto_subscribe).


Admins in the publishing environment filter to the appropriate data for each subscriber organization before publishing content.Â Manage your publications and subscribers from the **Publications** section of **Domo Everywhere**.  
  
This article discusses publishing content in the following topics:



* [Publications](#publications)
* [Sort publications](#sort_publications)
* [PublicationÂ tasks](#publishing_tasks)
* [CreateÂ a publication](#creating_publication)

7. SelectÂ **Refresh**Â to refresh the publication for the subscribers you selected and close the modal.


Â
**Note:** If you make changes to a dashboard or a card on a dashboard, you need to refresh the publication in order for the updates to display in the subscriber organization.
Â 


Â
**Important:** Do not modify the source dashboards while the job is being refreshed. This causes the layout of the dashboard to change and corrupts the layout of cards in the subscriber organization.

### Delete a Publication


1. From the navigation header, go to **More** > **Admin**.
2. In the **Domo Everywhere**Â menu, select **Publications**.
3. In the **Publications** tab of the **Publications** section, locate the publication you want to refresh.
4. Hover over the publicationÂ untilÂ ![Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_6.18.37_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_6.18.37_PM.png)**Publication OptionsÂ**displays and select it.

 ![delete.png](delete.png)
6. The **Delete Publication**Â dialog displays with a warning of how much content you are removing. You must acknowledge the removal of that content before you can proceed.
7. Select **Confirm** to delete the publication.


Â
**Note:** This immediately starts the process of removing the dashboards, cards, and DataSets that have been subscribed to by all subscriber organizations.
Â [Back to top](#toc)Â 


### Remove Dashboard from a Publish Job


Â 


Â
**Warning:** When editing an existing publication, if you remove a dashboard from the publication, the underlying DataSets powering the dashboard are also automatically removed. If the subscriber organization is using any of those DataSets to power any custom-built cards within their Domo environment, those cards are also automatically deleted from the subscriber organization when the page and its related DataSets are removed.
To remove a page from a publication while preserving the DataSets that power the page, make sure that all of the DataSets you want to keep are reselected in the **DataSet** section of the **Publication Creation** modal before you save the publication.


Â [Back to top](#toc)Â 


### Subscribe to a Publication


Subscriber organizations can subscribe to a publication that has been created and saved in the publishing organization. With auto-subscription, a subscriber organization can choose to trust and accept all subscriptions from a specific publishing organization, rather than accepting every subscription individually.


#### Subscribe to an Individual PublicationÂ


The first set of steps below details how to subscribe to an individual publication.Â See the [Auto-Subscribe](#auto_subscribe)Â heading for instructions for how to auto-subscribe.


1. Begin in the subscriber organization's Domo environment.
2. From the navigation header, go to **More** > **Admin**.
3. In the **Domo Everywhere** menu, select **Subscriptions**.  
 The **Subscriptions** section displays.Â 
 ![subscriptions.png](subscriptions.png)
4. Go to the **Invitations** tab.
5. Review the invitations and select **Subscribe** for the appropriate invitations. A dialog displays to confirm that you are accepting the invitation(s).Â 
 ![Accept_Invitation.png](Accept_Invitation.png)
6. Select **Accept** to confirm the subscription. The data from the publishing organization populates in the subscriber organization.


The process is complete when the invitation disappears from theÂ **InvitationsÂ**tab and displays in theÂ **Subscriptions** tab.


Â
**Important:Â**The DataSets are available as soon as you accept the invitation, but you must refresh your browser to view the visualizations.
Â [Back to top](#toc)Â 


#### Auto-Subscribe to All Publications From an Organization


Follow these steps to auto-subscribe to publications from a specific organization:


1. In the **Domo Everywhere** menu in theÂ Admin Settings, selectÂ **Subscriptions**.Â TheÂ **Subscriptions**Â page has three tabs:Â **Subscriptions**,Â **Invitations**, andÂ **Settings**.
2. Go to theÂ **Settings**Â tab.Â
3. In theÂ **SettingsÂ**tab, selectÂ **+ Add Auto-Subscription**.  
 TheÂ **Add auto-subscription**Â modal displays.Â 
 ![add auto subscription.png](add auto subscription.png)
4. In the **Domain name** field, enter the Domo domain name for the publishing organization. The format isÂ *companyname*.domo.com.
 ![auto-subscription modal.png](auto-subscription modal.png)
5. In theÂ **Subscription**Â **ownerÂ**field, enter a name for theÂ owner of the subscription. We recommend that the owner be a service account.
6. (Optional) In the **Share subscription**Â field, search for and add users or groups to this auto-subscription. While this step is optional, this field is where you can configure [Default Sharing](#default_sharing).
7. SelectÂ **Add**Â to add the auto-subscription orÂ **Cancel**Â to close the modal without saving.


The auto-subscription now displays in theÂ **SettingsÂ**tab of theÂ **SubscriptionsÂ**page, as well as in the list of subscriptions in the **Subscriptions** tab.

Â
**Note:** You can edit or remove the auto-subscription from the **Settings** tab. You cannot remove the auto-subscription from the subscriptions list in the **Subscriptions** tab.
Â [Back to top](#toc)Â 


#### Default Sharing


Default Sharing allows subscriber organizations to automatically share all publications from a specified publishing organization to any number of users or groups.


1. In theÂ **Add auto-subscriptionÂ**modal, accessed while [adding an auto-subscription](#auto_subscribe), enter the Domo domain for the publishing organization that you want to automatically share publications from.
2. In theÂ **Share subscription**Â field, enter any users or groups that you want to automatically push publications to.

### Lock the Dashboard


We recommend that subscriber organizations lock published dashboards. This is because if the publisher makes an update to the visualizations on their side, those changes override any changes made by subscriber organizations.Â 


You can lock the dashboard by selectingÂ **Lock** at the top of the dashboard.


![lock_the_dashboard.png](lock_the_dashboard.png)


If you want to make edits to the visualizations in the publication, it's best to make a copy of the dashboard by going to ![Screen_Shot_2022-10-15_at_7.27.10_AM.png](Screen_Shot_2022-10-15_at_7.27.10_AM.png)**Dashboard optionsÂ**> ![Screen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_6.16.01_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_6.16.01_PM.png) **Save as** . Make edits to the duplicate version.


![save_as.png](save_as.png)


Â [Back to top](#toc)Â 


### Unsubscribe from a Publication


1. From the navigation header, go to **More** > **Admin**.
2. In the **Domo Everywhere** menu, select **Subscriptions**.Â 
 ![subscriptions.png](subscriptions.png)
3. In the **Subscriptions** tab of the **Subscriptions** section, locate the publication you want to unsubscribe from.
4. Hover over the publicationÂ untilÂ  ![Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_6.18.37_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_6.18.37_PM.png)**Subscriptions OptionsÂ**displays and select it.
5. Select **Delete**. A dialog displays, confirming that you want to delete the subscription.
6. SelectÂ **Confirm** orÂ **Cancel**.Â


Â
**Note:**Â Completing these steps immediately starts the process of removing the dashboards, cards, and DataSets that have been subscribed to as part of the publication.

PDP Policies for Published Content
----------------------------------


This section contains information about Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) for publishing.



* If you share the same DataSet in two publications to the same subscriber organization, the PDP policies of the more recently saved publication are used for data permissions.
* If you want to share the same DataSet to the same subscriber organization twice with different permissions, you must duplicate the DataSet in the publishing organization's Domo environment.


### Dynamic PDP


When you set up a publication using the Dynamic PDP by Org ID permission type, only the part of the DataSet that you want that subscriber organization to see is published to their Domo environment. This keeps your data even more secure and is simple to edit if you need to change the data a subscriber organization receives at a later time.


The Dynamic PDP takes effect the next time the publication is refreshed.

Notes
-----



* Domo Everywhere supports publishing Domo Bricks. For more information, see our [Domo Bricks](http://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/4423762260375?language=en_US) article.
* Dataset Views can be published across organizations. Remember to follow the best practicesÂ for PDP policies as describedÂ in [Publishing DataSet Views](..\publishing_dataset_views\index.md).
* Alerts are not copied when publishing across organizations. SubscriberÂ organizations can create CardÂ Alerts on their side that are triggered by numerical thresholds (as shown below on the right). DataSet Alerts for appending new rows or changing values are not compatible with the virtual DataSets from a publication (as shown below on the left).  
   
 ![Picture1.png](Picture1.png)
* Beast Mode calculationsÂ are only copied to the subscriber organization if they are being used in the cards that are published.
* Federated data can be published, with the caveat that the published data, if the original source is federated, cannot be run in a DataFlow.


Â [Back to top](#toc)Â 


### Publish the Same DataSet via Two Publish JobsÂ


Each publication pushes all of the DataSets that exist within it to the subscriber organization, even if any of the DataSets already exists in the subscriber organization's Domo environment due to another publication already publishing that DataSet to the same subscriber organization.Â   
  
Within the subscriber organization, each copy of the DataSet has the same name, but different values for `Dataset\_Id`. Each copy of the DataSet is tied to the specific publication it was published with.Â   
  
We recommend only publishing a given DataSet to a subscriber organization at one time in one publication.
