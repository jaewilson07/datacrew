Intro
-----


You can use the Org Explorer feature to view the org chart for your company. This feature is found in the [Profile page](..\profile_page_layout\index.html "Profile Page").Â 


Specifying your place in the organization
-----------------------------------------


In the Profile page, you can specify who you report to and who reports to you in your organization. As you and other users specify these relationships, they are added to the org chart. When changes are made to these relationshipsâ€”for example, if you change departments and specify a new supervisor in the Profile pageâ€”the org chart is updated accordingly.


You do not need to specify your peers (those who report to the same person as you). Domo determines these automatically when they specify the same supervisor as you.


If you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Edit Users" enabled, you can specify org chart relationships for others in your organization.Â For more information about default security roles, seeÂ [Managing Custom Roles](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Security Role Reference").


**To specify your place in your company org chart,**


1. Open your Profile page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, aÂ ![](0.png)Â icon appears instead.)
2. Mouse over the area to the right of the "Reports to" text.  
 A pencil icon appears.

3. Click the pencil icon.  
 A field pops up in which you can select the name of the person to whom you report.
4. Enter the name of the person to whom you report. As you enter letters, the names of all users matching the letters you've entered pop up in a scrollable list.
5. Select the name you want from the list.
6. Click **Save**.
7. To select the names of those who report to you, click the + in the "Reports" area then repeat steps 4-6 for each person you want to add.

Viewing your org chartÂ
-----------------------


You can view your company org chart using the Org Browser feature in the Profile page.


**To view your company org chart,**


1. Do one of the following:



	* Open your Profile page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, a ![](0.png)Â icon appears instead.)
	* Open the Profile page for another user by clicking that user's profile picture anywhere it appears.
2. Click **View Full Org**, which is found on the right side of the profile header.

YourÂ organizational line to the CEO appears, with your superiors, peers, and reports called out. You can see other individuals and lines in the chart by searching for specific employees or clicking on different employees in the chart. These actions are described more in continuation.


To close the Org Browser and return to the Profile page, click ![](5.png).


### Understanding connections


Circles with profile pictures appear for all usersÂ in your organizational line who have specified their place in the hierarchy, starting with the CEO at the top and drilling down toÂ each successive individual in the line.Â The selected individual's picture appears larger than the others to make it easier to spot. In addition,Â that picture and the pictures of all the selected individual's superiors are connected by a thick blue line, while pictures ofÂ the selected individualÂ and his or her peers and reportsÂ are connected by a thin gray line.Â 


**Organization Explorer Example**


In the following example, the user has selected the individual named "Blaine Mossman." A thick blue line connects BlaineÂ to hisÂ supervisor, Andie Breiter, and continues from Chad to his supervisor, Charlie O'Brien. Blaine's four directÂ reports are connected to himÂ by a thin gray line. In addition, Blaine's fourÂ peers (that is, those individuals who also report to AndieÂ Breiter) are shown next to her, also connected by a gray line. Andie's peers are not shownÂ in this view, butÂ you could see them by clicking the circle to the left of her picture. Â

Only one level of reports is shown below the selected individual. In the previous example, Brett Haymond's reports are not shown because his supervisor, Blaine Mossman, is selected.Â However, you can see further down the hierarchy by selectingÂ a report.Â In the following example, the user has selected Brett Haymond, so his reports are now shown.


![](7.png)


TheÂ graphicÂ in the bottom center ofÂ the Org Explorer (under the "How Are You Connected?" text)Â showsÂ theÂ selected user'sÂ connection to theÂ CEO.Â In the following example, theÂ connection line is shown between userÂ "Brett Haymond" and his CEO, Charlie O'Brien.

### Viewing a user's name and position


When you click a user's picture, their name, position, and contact informationÂ appears at the bottom left of the Org Explorer, under "Employee Selection." You can then jump directly to that user's Profile page by clickingÂ **View Profile**. You can also send an email to the user by clicking **Send Email**. This opens your email client, with the user's email address entered automatically.


### Searching for a user


In the top right corner of the Org Explorer, there is a **Search Users**Â bar you can use to search for any user in the Org Explorer. When a user is found, his or her connection line is shown, and the information in **How Are You Connected?** and **Employee Selection** is updated accordingly.Â
