New features and enhancementsÂ
------------------------------


Features and enhancements for our May 2018 release include the following:


### Alerts Wizard with Custom Message Builder


Creating alerts in DomoÂ is now easier than ever thanks to our new 3-step Alerts Wizard. In addition to guiding you through longstanding alert-building processes such as configuring alert rules and sharing alerts, the WizardÂ also includes a Custom Message Builder. This new tool allows you toÂ customize the message that is sent when an alert is triggered. Instead of having to read a system-generated message that may not always make sense to recipients, you canÂ now configure your own templates on a per-alert basis.Â 


When you goÂ to set up a new alert, you can write yourÂ own text and incorporate system variables to produce a more human-readable, friendly, and informative alert message, which can provide more context to recipients faster. The result is dynamically-generated messages sent to alert recipientsÂ that clearly provide information on what the alert is supposed to tell them about, as well as what has triggered the alert.Â   
  
Managing by exception and keeping everyone on the same page at the same time just got one notch easier.

For more information about creating alerts, seeÂ Creating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card.


### Custom Charts


Domo has added support for custom data-driven maps. All you need to do is upload an image and Domo does the rest. You can create any maps pertinent to your business, such as maps for countries not available by defaultÂ in Domo, like this map of Hong Kong:  
Â 


![custommaps_hongkong.png](custommaps_hongkong.png)  
Â 


Or you can build geographical maps divided by region, like this regionalized sales map for the United States:![custommaps_usregions.png](custommaps_usregions.png)  
  
  
  
  
  
You can evenÂ build maps of objects like office layouts, assembly lines, production/shipping facilities, or seats on an airplane, like the following:Â   
Â 


![custommaps_plane.png](custommaps_plane.png)


Â 


All of these mapsÂ are powered by your own data, so any time your data updates, your maps will update as well.Â Â 


Depending on the complexity of your maps, you may be able to upload maps without having to edit the SVG, or you may need to make code changes, which will most likely require a working knowledge of XML.Â 


For more information, seeÂ Adding Custom Charts to Domo.Â 


### Microsoft Word Plugin


Use the Domo Word plugin to download cards or DataSet data from DomoÂ into Microsoft Word.Â This is an excellent way to share your Domo data with others in your company who may not have access to Domo.Â 


Using this plugin, you can do all of the following:



* ImportÂ KPIÂ cardsÂ or individual components of KPI cards (such as chart/table content, summary numbers, owner name, etc.) into Word.
* Use query tables to import DataSet data as selected fields or as a single value.
* Highlight the Domo content in your Word document so viewers can recognize it immediately.
* Refresh the contentâ€”if anything has changed in the card or DataSet, it will be "redownloaded."


Users with whom you share documents with Domo content do not need to have the plugin installed to edit or view those documents. However, if they want to update the Domo content, they must have the plugin installed.Â 


Just as with Domo's other Microsoft Office plugins, the Word plugin is not available forÂ the Mac OS.Â Â Â

For more information, seeÂ [Using the Domo Word Plugin](..\using_the_domo_word_plugin\index.html "Using the Domo Word Plugin").


### NLQ Bots


SometimesÂ youÂ just want to see single-valued key metrics in the fastest possible way. Domo's new Natural Language QueryÂ (NLQ) Bots allow youÂ to query Domo directly from Buzz to get an answer in a language that everyone can understand.Â   
  
To use NLQ Bots, youÂ simply install aÂ Bot in Buzz, just like an app,Â then query Buzz for information using natural language. Buzz returns a response to the query in natural language too. This enables business leaders to quickly get insights on demand on any platform that supports Buzz. For example, if you had the ShopifyÂ Bot integrated with your Buzz, you would simply enterÂ /shopifyÂ followed by a question such as "how many refunds for march?" Buzz would then generate and display the answer to your question. For any connector with NLQ Bots enabled, you can see several sample questions just by clicking the "?" icon next to theÂ **Command NameÂ**field.  
Â

For more information about Bots, seeÂ [Adding a Bot to Buzz](..\adding_a_bot_to_buzz\index.html "Adding a Bot to Buzz").


### DomoStats


Introducing the freedom to explore what is happening in Domo for your company. Have you ever wondered how many users you have, who has logged in this past week, what cards are being created, and which DataSets are running? DomoStats lets MajorDomos and Admin users power up a QuickStart app with a pre-built dashboard with details about card views, user logins, and DataSet creation so they can see everything happening in their Domo. The live DataSets behind DomoStats gives you the visibility into these questions and the opportunity to build cards, alerts, and DataFlows around these new and powerful stats.Â Find DomoStatsÂ in the Appstore right now and get started exploring!

### Unannounced Features and Enhancements


The following features have been available now for the past month but are just beingÂ announced:Â 


### Custom Card Sizing


We are excited to announce custom sizing for Domo cards. Now you can display your cards usingÂ custom size configurations toÂ more easily convey your business stories. From tall and skinny layouts, to wide and short views, toÂ really large full-page cards, you can choose the optimal sizesÂ for every card type while still maintaining the clean and grid organization you expect in your Domo dashboards. Emphasize your most important cards and shrink your supporting cards to draw attention to what really matters in your data.

### Spark Line and Spark Bar Charts


Two new chart types have been added to Domo's expansive chart library, Spark Line and Spark Bar.Â These new charts giveÂ you even more options for presenting business stories to meet your company's needs.


SparkÂ Line and Spark Bar graphs are similar in most respects toÂ standard Line and Bar graphs except that they



* includeÂ a built-in gauge that shows the degree of change in the chart data, enabling you to answer your business questions at a glance, and
* do not include axes, providing a simple and uncluttered view of rises and falls in your data.  
 Â

* [Spark Line Graph](..\spark_line_chart\index.html "Spark Line Graph")
* [Spark Bar Graph](..\spark_bar_chart\index.html "Spark Bar Graph")


### Map Improvements


A number of improvements designed to increase usefulness ofÂ maps have been released. You can now do all of the following:



* Zoom and pan on maps using your mouse's scroll button.
* Add data labels to any map.
* Toggle progressive disclosure of city names (i.e. more cities will appear on the map as you zoom in).
* Filter to see selected regions.
* Auto-zoom to show only those regions included in your DataSet.
* Hide "No Data" items on the map.
* Add hover text.
* Create a full ZIP code map by filtering to one state.


For more information about all of these options, seeÂ [Properties for Maps](..\properties_for_maps\index.html "Properties for Maps").
