Intro
-----


An outliers chart is nearly identical to a basic line chart but allows you to call out any points you deem to be outliers. Be aware that the line in an outliers chart is built from X and Y coordinate pairs, *not* from date-time values as in a typical line chart. However, you can use numbers to represent time periods. For example, in the graphic further down in this topic, the numbers in the "X-axis" column represent months in a time scale.


This chart type does *not* currently include algorithms to identify outlier points. You must identify these points yourself in the DataSet you use to power the chart. However, you can use tools such as R and Python to help you identify these outliers.


Powering outliers charts
------------------------


Outliers charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet. Two of these contain the X and Y coordinate values for each point, as in a [scatter plot chart](..\scatter_plot_chart\index.html "Scatter Plot Graph"). The third column contains a value of TRUE or FALSE for each coordinate pair. If the point is considered an outlier, the value should be TRUE; if it is not an outlier, the value should be FALSE. For an example, see the graphic below.Â 


For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer,Â you choose the columns containing the data for your outliers chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see [KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\analyzer_overview\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer").


The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into an outliers chart. (For clarification purposes, the values in the "X-Axis" column represent months.)

Customizing outliers charts
---------------------------


You can customize the appearance of an outliers chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see [Chart Properties](..\applying_and_resetting_chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
