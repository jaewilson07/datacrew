Intro

Weather Underground provides national, local and crowd-sourced weather reports. To learn more about the Weather Underground API, visit their page ([https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ "https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/")).


You connect to your Weather Underground account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Weather Underground connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Weather Underground account and create a DataSet, you must have a Weather Underground API key. To sign up for a key, visitÂ [https://www.wunderground.com/signup?mode=api\_signup](https://www.wunderground.com/signup?mode=api_signup "https://www.wunderground.com/signup?mode=api_signup").Â

This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Weather Underground Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").
