In a user'sÂ ProfileÂ page, you can see which cardÂ **Details**Â views that user has viewed most recently or most frequently. You do this in theÂ **Viewing**Â tab, which is located in the tab row under the user statistics panel.

**To see what cards a user has been viewing,**


1. Navigate to that user'sÂ **Profile**Â page by clicking that user's profile picture anywhere it appears. If you want to see your own cards, you can access your personalÂ **Profile**Â page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, aÂ ![](2.png) icon appears instead.)
2. ClickÂ **Viewing**Â in the tab row under the user statistics panel.


In this tab, you can toggle betweenÂ **Recently Viewed**Â and **Trending Cards**.Â Cards the user has viewed most frequently/recently appear higher in the tab, and cards he/she has not viewed as recently/appear lower in the tab.Â If you click a card, itsÂ [Details view](..\card_details_view_layout\index.md)Âopens.Â
