Intro
-----


A category scatter chart is similar to a [scatter plot chart](..\scatter_plot_chart\index.html "Scatter Plot Graph") in that items are plotted using X-Y coordinatesâ€”for every x and y value pair, a bubble is plotted on the chart. However, whereas in a scatter plot chart points are plotted at the intersection of two values, a category scatter chart includes both a value scale and a category scale, and bubbles are plotted at the intersection of each category-value pairing. Categories are represented down the y-axis and values are measured along the x-axis, as in horizontal bar charts.


Powering category scatter charts
--------------------------------


A category scatter chart requires two columns of data in your DataSetâ€”one for categories and one for values. For information about value andÂ category data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your category scatter chart. For more information, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a category scatter chart:

Customizing category scatter charts
-----------------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a category scatter chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
