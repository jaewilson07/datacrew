In a user'sÂ ProfileÂ page, in theÂ **Badges**Â pane you can see the badgesÂ awarded to the user. You can also award aÂ badge to this user if you have permission to award that badge. You get permission to award a badge when a user with an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage Company Settings" enabled grants you permission in the Admin Settings. Otherwise you cannot award badges, even if you already have an "Admin" security role. For information about creating a badgeÂ and assigning who can award it, see [Managing Custom Roles](..\managing_custom_roles\index.html "Creating Badges for Achievements").


**To award a badge,**


1. Open the user'sÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking his or her profile picture anywhere that it appears.
2. Do one of the following:


	1. Click the + button that appears under the "Latest badge earned" text in the profile header. If you do not have permissions to award any badges, this button does not appear.

	2. Navigate to theÂ **Badges**Â pane either by clicking theÂ BadgesÂ navigation button under the user statistics panel or by scrolling down until you find it, then clickÂ **Give a Badge**. If you do not have permissions to award any badges, this button does not appear.

	 A list appears containing the names of the badges you have permissions to award.
3. Click theÂ badge you want to award.  
 The image for theÂ badge appears in theÂ **Badges**Â pane.
