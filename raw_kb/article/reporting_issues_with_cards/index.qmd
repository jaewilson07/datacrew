Intro
-----


You can report card issues (data discrepancies, chart design, etc.) and send the report to the card owner, who will bear responsibility for resolving the issues. You can report an issue from either the card page or the card Details view. If the data in a card is not loading, a **Report an Issue** button appears on that card.


When you report an issue with a card, a number of things happen:



* A ![problem_icon.png](problem_icon.png) icon appears on the bottom of the card, indicating the number of issues reported in this card.
* The report is sent via email/text to the card owner, the card followers, and the user who reported the issue.
* The **Issues Reported** tab appears in the Details view for the card.  
 In this tab, you can read about this and other reported issues, mark issues as resolved, and report new issues.


Reporting an issue
------------------


You can report an issue from either the card page or the card Details view.


**To report an issue from the card page,**


1. Do one of the following:



	* (Conditional) If the **Report an Issue** button appears in the card, click the button.
	* Mouse over the card with an issue, click ![Screen_Shot_2020-04-10_at_2.51.50_PM.png](Screen_Shot_2020-04-10_at_2.51.50_PM.png)![](2.png), then select **Report an Issue**.
2. Enter a description of the issue in the empty field.
3. Click **Report the Issue** to send your report.


To report an issue from the Details view,


1. In the card Details view, click the **Report an Issue** icon, which is located in the lower right corner of the Details view.
2. Enter a description of the issue in the empty field.
3. Click **Report the Issue** to send your report.


Marking an issue as resolved
----------------------------


You can mark an issue as resolved from the Details view for the card.


When you mark an issue as resolved, the following things happen:



* The number of issues reported on the card and in the Details view drops by one.  
 If only one issue was reported, the **Issues Reported** icon on the card and the **Issues Reported** tab in the Details view disappear.
* The description of the resolution is sent via email/text to the card owner, the card followers, and the user who reported the issue.


**To mark an issue as resolved,**


1. In the card Details view, click the ![problem_icon.png](problem_icon.png) icon on the card with an issue.  
 The Details view opens, with the **Issues Reported** tab open at the top of the page. You can also get to this point by clicking the card to open the Details view, then clicking **Issues Reported** to open the tab.
2. Click **Mark as Resolved**.
3. Enter a description of how you resolved the issue in the empty field.
4. Click **Resolve the Issue**.
