Intro
-----


Symbol Overlay charts are similar toÂ [Symbol charts](..\symbol_chart\index.html "Stacked Bar Graph"), the difference being that in a Symbol chart, symbolsÂ in a given series areÂ shown side by side rather than overlaid on top of each other.Â Â Â Â 


Symbol Overlay charts include both vertical and horizontal subtypes. In a vertical Symbol Overlay chart, categoriesÂ are represented along the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and valuesÂ are measured on the vertical axis (or y-axis).Â A horizontalÂ Symbol Overlay chart has the same overall concept, but the categories are represented along the vertical axis and the values are represented along the horizontal axis.


PoweringÂ Symbol Overlay charts
-------------------------------


AÂ Symbol Overlay chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSetâ€”one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for yourÂ Symbol Overlay chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, seeÂ [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Card Builder").


The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into aÂ vertical SymbolÂ Overlay chart:

The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into aÂ horizontal SymbolÂ Overlay chart:

CustomizingÂ Symbol Overlay charts
----------------------------------


You can customize the appearance of aÂ Symbol chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
