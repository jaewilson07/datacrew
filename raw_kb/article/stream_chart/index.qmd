Intro
-----


A Stream chart is a cross between a horizontal [Stacked Area chart](..\stacked_area_chart\index.html "Stacked Area Graph") and a Funnel chart.Â Series data is optional in Stream chart. Series in a Stream chart, if included, are centered. They do not share the same baseline and do not overlap. These charts also do not show value data except upon mouse-over. Therefore they are most effective for showing relative differences between stages rather than representing exact amounts.


This chart type is exactly the same as a [Stream Funnel chart](..\stream_funnel_chart\index.html "Stream Funnel Graph") (classified in the Chart Picker as a Pie/Funnel chart rather than an Area chart) but is shown horizontally rather than vertically. Â 


The following example shows a Stream chart without series data:

Whereas the next example shows the same chart with series data applied:

Powering Stream Charts
----------------------


Stream charts require two columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”a category column or row containing the names of each stage, and a value column or row containing the corresponding values for each stage. You can also add a column containing series data if you want. For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer,Â you choose the columns containing the data for your Stream chart. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.html "KPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer").


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category, value, and series columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Stream chart:

Customizing Stream Charts
-------------------------


You can customize the appearance of a Funnel chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
