You can learn more about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Card listing | The list of all of the cards that have been added to this Domo instance. If you click a row for a Card, a details panel opens. This panel shows a preview of the card, details such as owner and DataSet name, and a list of users with access. In this panel you can click the DataSet name to jump to the Details viewÂ for the DataSet, or you can select the name of a user to open a details panel for that user.
When you select a card's title the **Edit** button becomes available. |
| Select/Deselect | Allow you to select or deselect all Cards in the listing. If any filters are applied, only the Cards that pass the filters are selected. Selecting Cards causes the **Edit** button to become available. |
| Column filters | Allow you to filter the Cards listing. You can apply filters by clicking the  icon for a column and selecting the items you want to appear in the list. You can filter multiple columns at once. For example, if you wanted to show only document Cards owned by "Alicia Steele," you would select **Doc Card** for the **Type** column and do a search for "Alicia Steele" in the **Owner** column.
Filters you add appear highlighted in blue at the top of the window, next to the **Select** and **Deselect** options. You can quickly remove a filter by clicking the "x" next to it.
Columns with filters applied are indicated using the  icon. You can click this icon to edit the filters for that column. |

When you select **Pages** in the sub-tab menu, a listing of all Pages in your instance appears. You can filter the Pages in this list, as well as make individual or bulk changes to Pages, such as adding or removing user/group access, moving Pages in the hierarchy, etc.

You can learn more about these components in the following table:




| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Page listing | The list of all of the Pages that have been added to this Domo instance. If you click a row for a Page, a details panel opens. This panel lists all Cards on the Page, along with all people and groups with access to the Page.

When you select a Page (by clicking its checkbox), the **Edit** button becomes available. |
| Select/Deselect | Allow you to select or deselect all Pages in the listing. If any filters are applied, only the Pages that pass the filters are selected. Selecting Pages causes the **Edit** button to become available. |
| Column filters | Allow you to filter the Pages listing. You can apply filters by clicking the  icon for a column and selecting the items you want to appear in the list. You can filter multiple columns at once. For example, if you wanted to show Pages owned by "Alicia Steele" with more than 10 Cards, you would do a search for "Alicia Steele" in the **Owner** column and set the filter in the **Cards** column to return values greater than 10.
Filters you add appear highlighted in blue at the top of the window, next to the **Select** and **Deselect** options. You can quickly remove a filter by clicking the "x" next to it.
Columns with filters applied are indicated using the  icon. You can click this icon to edit the filters for that column. |
