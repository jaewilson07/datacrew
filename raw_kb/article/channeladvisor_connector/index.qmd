Intro
-----


ChannelAdvisor provides cloud-based ecommerce solutions that enable retailers and manufacturers to integrate, manage and optimize their merchandise sales. To learn more about the ChannelAdvisor API, visit their page ([https://developer.channeladvisor.com/](https://developer.channeladvisor.com/ "https://developer.channeladvisor.com/")).


You connect to your ChannelAdvisor account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the ChannelAdvisor connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your ChannelAdvisor account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* Your ChannelAdvisorÂ API developer key
* Your ChannelAdvisor password


To obtain ChannelAdvisor developer credentials, visitÂ [http://complete.channeladvisor.com/D...ApiDevKey.aspx](http://complete.channeladvisor.com/DeveloperNetwork/RequestApiDevKey.aspx "http://complete.channeladvisor.com/DeveloperNetwork/RequestApiDevKey.aspx").Â 


Connecting to Your ChannelAdvisor Account
-----------------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the ChannelAdvisor Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your ChannelAdvisor account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Developer Key | Enter your ChannelAdvisorÂ API developer key. |
| Developer Password | Enter your ChannelAdvisor developer password. |


For information about receiving credentials, see "Prerequisites," above.


Once you have entered valid ChannelAdvisor credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new ChannelAdvisor DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").

Troubleshooting
---------------


We have had customers report situations in which they still could not authenticate even with a working developer key. However, they were able to successfully authenticate after creating a SOAP API authorization on the account. The following page provides more information about how to do this:Â [https://developer.channeladvisor.com...edentials-flow](https://developer.channeladvisor.com/authorization/soap-api-credentials-flow "https://developer.channeladvisor.com/authorization/soap-api-credentials-flow"). (It is possible this issue may only affect users with seller accounts.)Â Â
