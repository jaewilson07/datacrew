In a user'sÂ ProfileÂ page, you can viewÂ [alerts](..\managing_your_alerts\index.md)Â that that user is following. You do this in theÂ **Alerts**Â tab, which is located in the tab row under the user statistics panel.

For any alert in theÂ **Alerts**Â tab, you can do any of the following:



* Click the upper portion with alert information to open a panel for that alert. In this panel you can configure notifications for the alert, edit the alert, and view the alert history.
* Click the lower portion with card information to open theÂ **Details**Â view for the card.
* Specify whether you want to receive instant, daily, or weekly notifications.


**To view a user's subscribed alerts,**


1. Navigate to that user'sÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking that user's profile picture anywhere it appears. If you want to view your own favorite cards, you can access your personalÂ ProfileÂ page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, aÂ ![](1.png)Â icon appears instead.)
2. ClickÂ **Alerts**Â in the tab row under the user statistics panel.


For more information about alerts, see [Notifications and Alerts](..\..\category\notifications_and_alerts\index.html "Notifications and Alerts").
