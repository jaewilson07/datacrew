Intro
-----


Domo provides the ability to set scale markers on most chart types, either as single lines set on specific values or as ranges between two values. In the following example, a scale marker range has been set between the values ofÂ 225 and 1000. This indicates the "normal" range of data. Any value that falls within this range is considered "expected" and should not require further scrutiny. However,Â several data pointsâ€”one at January 5, one for January 11-13, and one at January 14â€”fall outside this normal range of data. Using the scale marker range, you can spot such outliers and make any necessary business decisions.

Available properties
--------------------


The following table lists and describes all properties of scale marker ranges available in the **Chart Properties**:


**Note:Â**Properties relating to percentiles, percentages, standard deviations, and quantiles are currently available *only*Â for single-series Bar charts and basic single-series and multiple-series Line charts.Â Â Â


| Property | Description | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | Lets you specifyÂ text to replace the default word "GOAL" that normally appears above the top left corner of the chart when a scale marker has been set. If the chart contains a legend, an item for the scale marker is added to the legend with this text (unless you hide it by checking theÂ **Scale Marker > Hide in Legend**Â box).Â  | No |
| Scale | In dual-scale charts, lets you specify whether the goal in the chart is associated with the left orÂ right scale. | Yes (for dual-scale charts) |

| Value Type | Lets you determine how the scale marker line is calculated. A range of options is available, such as minimum and maximum, average, standard deviation, and more. If you selectÂ **Manual**Â (the default), you enter the desired value in theÂ **Value**Â field. Otherwise the value is calculated from the data in the chart. | Yes |
| Value | Lets you specify the value of your scale marker line when you have selected **Manual**Â (or **Default)Â**for **Value Type**. This option is only available when you selectÂ **Line**Â in theÂ **TypeÂ**menu. | Yes (for Line markers) |
| Percentile Value | Lets you calculate the value of your line based on a specified percentile value between 0 and 100.

Understanding scale marker types
--------------------------------


Scale markers in Domo charts can be broken down into the following types:



* **Line markers.**Â These are scale markers that consist of a single line.
* **Range markers.**Â These are scale markers that consist of two lines and the space between them.Â
* **Quantile markers.Â**These are scale markers that divide the area between your chart's minimum and maximum values into equally-spacedÂ quantiles. Â Â Â


Line and range markers can be broken down further depending on whether they are based on static or dynamic values. (Quantile markers by nature are dynamic.) By default, when you selectÂ **Line**Â orÂ **Range**Â in theÂ **TypeÂ**menu, you are asked to enter a value or values for the line or range. Scale markers based on these values are static; they will not change when the chart data changes. If you select any option other thanÂ **Default**Â orÂ **Manual**Â in theÂ **Value Type** menu (or **Upper Value Type/Lower Value** **TypeÂ**menus for a range), however, your scale markers become dynamic; theyÂ update based on changes in your chart data. These dynamic value types are described in more detail in the following section.


### Value types for line and range markers


This section describes all of the options available in the **Scale Marker >**Â **Value Type/Upper Value Type/Lower Value Type**Â menus in Chart Properties. All of the examples provided here are for line markers but apply to range markers as well.


#### Manual


This is the default setting. When you selectÂ **Manual**Â for your value type, you are asked to enter a static value for your marker or markers. Markers entered in this way do not change when your chart data changes.


#### Minimum


When you select **Minimum**Â as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the minimum value in the chart.


![](1.png)


#### Maximum


When you select **Maximum**Â as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the maximum value in the chart.


![](2.png)


#### Average


When you select **Average**Â as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the average value in the chart.


![](3.png)


#### Median


When you select **Median**Â as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the medianÂ value in the chart.


![](4.png)


#### Percentile


When you select **Percentile**Â as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to a given percentile value, which you specify in theÂ **Percentile Value** field for a line marker and the **Lower Percentile Value**/**Upper Percentile Value**Â fields for a range marker. In the example below, the percentile value has been set to 85.


![](5.png)


#### Percentage


When you selectÂ **Percentage**Â as the value type for a scale marker, you are asked to enter a percentage value (in the **Percentage Value**Â field for a line marker or the **Lower Percentage Value**/**Upper Percentage** **ValueÂ**fields for a range marker) as well as select whether the percentage is derived from the maximum (default), minimum, average, or median value of the chart (in theÂ **Percentage Of**Â dropdown menuÂ for a line marker or the **Lower Percentage Of**/**Upper Percentage Of****Â**menus for a range marker).


In the example below, the user entered 50 for theÂ **Percentage Value**Â and selectedÂ **Average**Â in theÂ **Percentage OfÂ**menu, so the chart shows the scale marker on the line corresponding to 50% of the average value of the chart.


![](6.png)


#### Standard deviation


When you selectÂ **Standard Deviation**Â as the value type for a scale marker, you are asked to enter the number of standard deviations from the meanÂ (in the **Standard Deviations**Â field for a line marker or the **Lower Standard Deviations**/**Upper Standard Deviations****Â**fields for a range marker). If you enter a positive number, your marker appears above the mean; if you enter a negative number, your marker appears below the mean.Â 


In the example below, the user entered -3 in theÂ **Standard Deviations**Â field, so the marker corresponds to the line 3 standard deviations below the median.


![](7.png)


### Quantile markers


Quantiles divide the area between your chart's minimum and maximum values into regions of equal value, depending on the data in the chart. In the below example, the user has chosen to include 5Â quantiles (quintiles). This divides the chart into 5 regions, with the 3 regions closest to average appearing shaded.


![](8.png)Â 


As with all of the non-default value types for line and range scale markers, quantiles are dynamic and will update when your chart data updates.


To add a basic set of quantilesÂ as scale markers to your chart, you simply go into Chart Properties for your chart and selectÂ **Scale Marker > Type**Â **> Quantiles**. Then choose the desired number of quantilesÂ in theÂ **Number of Quantiles**Â menu. There are a number of other properties you can use to customize your quantiles, all optional. To learn more about these, see [Available Properties](#h_2e0c9590-db4a-49b8-a8a5-3210ca3ee23b "Adding Scale Markers to Your Chart"), above.


Quantiles are currently available only forÂ single-series bar charts and basic single-series and multiple-series line charts.Â Â Â
