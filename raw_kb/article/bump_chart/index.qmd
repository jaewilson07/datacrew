Intro
-----


You wanted to quickly see changes in rank over time, so we created bump charts. With bump charts, you can prioritize the change in rank over the change in numeric values.

Powering Bump Charts
--------------------


The bump chart requires the x-axis dimension, the y-axis measure and the series for multiple lines.


For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.md).


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your bump chart.Â For more information about choosing data columns, see [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.md).


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.md).


Customizing Bump Charts
-----------------------


You can customize the appearance of a bump chart by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, seeÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").
