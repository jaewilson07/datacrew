Intro
-----


A gauge is a simple chart that indicates progress towards meeting a target. A face gauge uses an image of a face to show progress towards a goal. Three ranges are availableâ€”a red frowning face for "poor," an orange face with a blank expression for "fair," and a green smiling face for "excellent." Other gauge types in Domo include [Comparative fill gauges](..\comparative_fill_gauge\index.html "Single Value Gauge").

Powering face gauges
--------------------


A face gauge requires only two columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”one contains categories, and the other contains the values. If multiple categories are present, only the first category is used; all the others are ignored. If the first category contains more than one series, the series are aggregated to yield a single value for the gauge unless you select **No Aggregation**. Only three ranges are available in face gauges. For more information about ranges, see [Setting Options for Gauges](..\setting_options_for_gauges\index.html "Setting Properties for Gauges")Â andÂ [Chart Properties](..\..\category\chart_properties\index.html "Chart Properties").


For information about value, category, and series data, see [Understanding Chart Data](..\understanding_chart_data\index.html "Understanding Chart Data").


In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your face gauge. For more information about choosing data columns, seeÂ [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](..\applying_dataset_columns_to_your_chart\index.html "Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart").


For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see [Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer](..\..\category\analyzer\index.md).


The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a face gauge:

Customizing face gauges
-----------------------


You can customize the appearance of a gauge by editing its **Chart Properties**. For information about all chart properties, see Chart Properties.Â For more information about gauge properties, see Setting Properties for Gauges.
