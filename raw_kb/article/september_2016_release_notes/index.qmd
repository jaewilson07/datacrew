**Note:** Depending on the product version you are using, the documentation may include information about features that may not be available or may have changed.
New features and enhancements
-----------------------------


Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


### Drill Path Reorder Capability


Previously when you set a drill path on a card, if you inadvertently added the drill levels in the wrong order, you had no choice but to delete all of the levels and start again from scratchâ€”an extremely frustrating scenario. With our new drill reorder capability, that frustration is now a thing of the past. In the updated drill edit screen, drill pathÂ levels are represented as movable tiles. If you add a level in the wrong sequence, worry notâ€”you can simply click and drag it almostÂ anywhere in the drill sequenceÂ (except for to the top or bottom of the drill path, since those spots are reserved for your top level view and table view, respectively), automatically adjusting your card's drill path. You can also edit or delete any movable path in the sequence.Â

For more information, seeÂ [Adding Drill Path to Your Chart](..\adding_a_drill_path_to_your_chart\index.html "Adding Drill Path to Your Chart").Â 


### Workbench 4.5


Workbench 4.5 is being released. In addition to bug fixes, this release provides the following improvements designed to make your Workbench experience easier:



* You no longer have to be an Admin in Windows to run Workbench. Non-Admin users can now access Workbench as long as they are assigned to the "Domo Workbench Users Group." All members of this group are allowed to configure and use Domo Workbench to upload data to Domo.  
   
 ![](1.png) Â
* Previously all data readers would do impersonation. We now launch the Data Collector Process as an impersonated user, which should especially help plugin writers.Â Â
* A new security option underÂ **Settings**Â allows you to require impersonation credentials for all DataSet Jobs. This option can only be modified by an Admin user.
* A new option underÂ **Additional Settings**Â for a DataSet Job lets you specify whether the Job waits for Adrenaline indexing before completing.Â
* If you change the impersonation credentials on a DataSet Job, Workbench now asks you if you want to change the credentials for all jobs that use those credentials.  
   
 ![](2.png)  
   
 Likewise, if you change the impersonation credentials for a provider, you are asked if you want toÂ change credentialsÂ on all Jobs that use that provider.  
   
 ![](3.png)
* In the Job Scheduler, if a DataSet Job is from a local file provider, you can now selectÂ **Watch File**Â for the Job. The Job will then run every time theÂ localÂ file is updated.
* A new plugin platform allows for backwards compatibility with older plugins.
* Password-protected Excel files are now supported.
* You can now change the name of a Workbench-imported DataSet in Domo.
* Improved migration between Workbench 2 and Workbench 4.5.Â


### New Publication Groups UIÂ


The Publication Groups interfaceÂ has been enhanced to provide a more intuitive user experience. The interface now guides users through the process of adding pages, setting DataSet filters, and configuring access groups.

For more information, seeÂ [Setting Up Publication Groups](..\setting_up_publication_groups\index.html "Setting Up Publication Groups").Â 


### 2-Factor AuthenticationÂ Â


Â
Â
**Note:**Â This feature is availableÂ *on demand.*  
Â 


To request that this feature be enabled,Â reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant.


Depending on the feature, you may be required to complete training before you can use the feature.
You can nowÂ enable multi-factor authentication for your company.Â InÂ **Admin Settings > Security > Authentication**, you have access to the following multi-factor authentication options:



* You can set a requirement that usersÂ redo their multi-factor authentication after a given number of days.
* You canÂ set a requirement that codes expire after a given number of failed attempts.Â
* You can see a list of all users who have notÂ entered their mobile number into theirÂ **Profile**Â pages. You can also sendÂ these users a Buzz message reminding them to provide their numbers.


Users willÂ *not*Â be able toÂ log into DomoÂ if you enable multi-factor authentication before they have a chance to enter their mobile numbers in theirÂ **Profile**Â pages. Make sure all of the employees in your company have entered their numbers before activating this feature.

For more information, seeÂ [Turning On Multi-Factor Authentication](..\turning_on_multifactor_authentication\index.html "Turning On Multi-Factor Authentication").


### Activity Logs


With the new Activity LogsÂ tool in the Admin Settings, you can get greater visibility of whatâ€™s changing and whoâ€™s changing it. View activityÂ logs for all users in your DomoÂ instance. Quickly filter the logs using any of four commonly used "quick filters." Or, if you want to dig deeper into the logs to single out a specific log or pinpoint a small range of logs, create customizedÂ combinations of filters. You can also refresh the logs appearing in the tabÂ or export the logs as a CSV file. Activity Logs provide data for the last 6 months.Â Â 


![](6.png)


For more information, seeÂ [Viewing Activity Logs](..\viewing_activity_logs\index.html "Viewing User Logs").


### License Management


TheÂ **User Licenses**Â tab in the Admin Settings shows you the number of licenses in use and lets you add new licenses.Â (If you have exceeded your number of licenses, this number appears red.) It also shows a history of license requests, with the date of request, the name of the requestor, and the number of requests for each individual transactions.


![](7.png)Â 


When you choose to add licenses and confirm the transaction, an email is sent to your AE, who then follows up with you, sends an invoice, etc. Â The License Manager doesÂ *notÂ*impede your ability to add new users on the fly.


For more information, seeÂ [Adding User Licenses in Domo](..\adding_user_licenses_in_domo\index.html "Adding User Licenses in Domo").


### Design Studio improvements


This update provides a new method for transitioning widgets to the artboard.Â Previously, a representation of the widget was placed on the artboard. This representation was in SVG formatÂ and could cause some confusion on what could be directly edited on the artboard versus within the configuration options for that widget. It also prevented exact representations for some widgets, such as the Table and YouTube Player from being shown accurately. The new HTML screenshot method gives a significant performance boost and more accurately represents how the widget will look once on the design. Whatever configurations are chosen for the widget, the artboard will replicate that. In addition, it will allow elements such as Legends to be moved more accurately on the design.Â 


Â
**Note:** Some widgets are HTML based and require this upgrade to be available in the Add Widgets menu. This includes the Table, YouTube Player, some Maps, and Filter control widgets. Â If you do not see these widgets on your list, you will need to upgrade to 2.0.6. Â Any designs that were created in an older version of Design Studio will function normally. Â
This release also includes



* Additional support for SSO authentication
* Updated Table widget instructional text
* Various bug fixes


### Page Search in More menuÂ


In theÂ **More**Â menu in the card page navigation bar, you canÂ filter to showÂ the desired page(s) or subpage(s) with their owners.Â By default,Â only top-level pages appear in theÂ **More**Â menu. However, when you enter a search term, both top-level pagesÂ *and*Â subpages appear in the menu as search results.Â 


![](8.png)


For more information, seeÂ [Searching in Domo](..\searching_in_domo\index.html "Searching in Domo").


### App search


Domo's global search now includes Appstore Apps matching your keyword in addition to Buzz messages, cards, and so on.Â Â
