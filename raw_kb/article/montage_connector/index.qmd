Intro
-----


Montage is an enterprise video and voice interviewing software company. The Domo Montage connector allows you to see your data related to clients, jobs, interviews, candidates and more. To learn more about the Montage API, visit their page (<https://reporting.moderhire.com/>).  


You connect to your Montage account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Montage connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed inÂ  [a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


Prerequisites
-------------


To connect to your Montage account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:



* The username and password for your Montage account
* Your Montage account API key


For information about obtaining an API key, reach out to your Montage representative.


Connecting to Your Montage Account
----------------------------------


This section enumerates the options in the **Credentials** and **Details** panes in the Montage Connector page.Â The components of the other panes in this page, **Scheduling**Â and **Name & Describe Your DataSet**, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length inÂ [Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector](..\adding_a_dataset_using_a_connector\index.html "Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector").


### Credentials Pane


This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Montage account. The following table describes what is needed for each field: Â 




| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Username | Enter the username for your Montage account. |
| Password | Enter the password for your Montage account. |
| API Key | Enter your Montage API key. |


Once you have entered valid Montage credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Montage DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the **Accounts** tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see [Managing User Accounts for Connectors](..\managing_user_accounts_for_connectors\index.html "Managing User Accounts for Connectors").


### Details Pane


This pane contains a primaryÂ **Reports**Â menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.




| Menu | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Select the Montage report you want to run.Â The following reports are available:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Candidates | Retrieves data about candidates for a given date or date range. |
| Clients | Retrieves data about clients. |
| Jobs | Retrieves data about jobs for a given date or date range. |
| Live Interviews | Retrieves data about live interviews for a given date or date range. |
| Meetings | Retrieves data about meetings for a given date or date range. |
| On Demand Interviews | Retrieves data about on-demand interviews for a given date or date range. |
| Users | Retrieves data about users for a given date or date range. |

 |
| Report DurationÂ  | Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.Â  |
| Report DateÂ  | Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.Â  |
| Select Specific DateÂ  | Select the date for the report.Â  |
| Days Back | Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.Â Â  |
| Start Date | Specify whether theÂ first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.Â You select the last date in your range inÂ **End Date**.Â  |
| End Date | Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range inÂ **Start Date**.Â Â  |
| Select Specific Start Date | SelectÂ the first date in your date range.Â  |
| Select Specific End Date | Select the second date in your date range.Â  |
| Days Back to Start From | Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to End At**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
| Days Back to End At | Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine withÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â to create a range of represented days.
For example, if you enteredÂ 10Â forÂ **Days Back to Start From**Â andÂ 5Â forÂ **Days Back to End At**, the report would contain data forÂ 10 days ago up untilÂ 5 days ago. |
