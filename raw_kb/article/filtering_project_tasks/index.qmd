You can filter the tasks in a project details view by doing any of the following:



* Entering a keyword in theÂ **Filter tasks**Â field. The project view filters to show only tasks with that keyword in their description.
* Clicking on a tag in the "Tags in this project" area. The project view filters to show only tasks that contain that tag. For "Tags in this project" to appear, you must specify a tag in at least one task in the project. You can do this when creating or editing a task. For more information, seeÂ [Creating and Assigning Project Tasks](..\creating_and_assigning_project_tasks\index.html "Creating and Assigning Project Tasks").
* Clicking on the pictures of the team members assigned to the tasks you want to show.
* Combining any of the above. For example, you could click a team member's photo to filter to show tasks assigned to that team member, and then enter a tag. This would filter to show tasks that are assigned to that team memberÂ *and*Â contain the tag you entered.


**Tip:** When you filterÂ asks in a project, your URL is updated to reflect your filter configuration. If you bookmark this URL, you can return to your project view with this specific filter configuration whenever youÂ want.

2. Click the picture of a team member assigned to the task(s) you want to show.  
 All pictures except for the one you clicked are grayed out, and the project is filtered so that only tasks to which this team member is assigned appear.
