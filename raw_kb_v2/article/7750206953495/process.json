If you choose\n **Add blank columns**\n , column names are automatically generated for the new columns. If you select\n\n\n**Stop at the first blank column**\n , the data import stops when an empty header is encountered.\n  |\n\n\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the Connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this Connector?\n\nYou need the email address and password associated with your\n\nAmazon public datasets connectors\n\naccount.\n\n###\n How do I know my\n\nAmazon public datasets Connector\n\ncredentials are secure?\n\nThe login process uses the OAuth process, so your credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n Why is the connector unable to pull the data?\n\n\n Ensure that the file is present in the S3 bucket and specify the correct file type in the connector settings. Also, remove null columns to allow the connector to retrieve the data.\n\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\n\n You may encounter a limit of 100 Amazon S3 buckets per account.\n\nTroubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 7750206953495\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003842\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAmazon public datasets Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,409\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "amazon_public_datasets_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
