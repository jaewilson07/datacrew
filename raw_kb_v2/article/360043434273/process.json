This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the PestRoutes connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your PestRoutes account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A PestRoutes authentication token.\n* A PestRoutes authentication key.\n* The subdomain of your PestRoutes account. This is the \"company name\" portion of your PestRoutes URL. For example, if your URL was\n **https://mycompany.pestroutes.com**\n , the subdomain would be\n\nmycompany\n\n.\n\nTo find your authentication token and key, reach out to your PestRoutes representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your PestRoutes Account\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the PestRoutes Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your PestRoutes account.
