Intro
-------

Atlassian Bitbucket is a web-based hosting service used for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems.  To learn more about the Bitbucket API, visit their page (

https://confluence.atlassian.com/bit...222724129.html

).


 You connect to your Bitbucket account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Bitbucket connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Bitbucket account and create a DataSet, you must have either Bitbucket or Google credentials.


 Connecting to Your Bitbucket Account
--------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Bitbucket Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


###
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Bitbucket connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Bitbucket accounts in Domo) to open the Bitbucket OAuth screen where you can choose to enter either Bitbucket or Google credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Bitbucket DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Bitbucket when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Bitbucket.


###
 Details Pane

This pane contains a primary
 **Reports**
 menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.
