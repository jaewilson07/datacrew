This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SQL Server Reporting Services with SharePoint connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to SSRS\u00a0and import SharePoint reports,\u00a0you must have the following:\n\n Your Active Directory username and password that provides access to SSRS.\n* The\u00a0Active Directory domain name that allows access to MS Reporting Services and SharePoint.\n\nConnecting to Your SQL Server Reporting Services with SharePoint Account\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SQL Server Reporting Services with SharePoint Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your SQL Server Reporting Services with SharePoint account.
