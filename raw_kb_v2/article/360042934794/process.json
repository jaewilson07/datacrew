For example, the tenth week of\u00a02012 would now display as \"03-04-2012\" instead of \"Week 10.\"\u00a0Domo administrators who want to revert back to the old format can do so\n **Admin Settings > Company Settings.**\n This is a global setting that affects all charts in a Domo instance; it cannot be turned on for individual users.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nChanging the Date Format in Your Chart\n\n.\n\n##\n Mobile updates\n\nSeveral cool new enhancements have just been released for our mobile product:\n\n###\n Landscape Mode\n\nDomo landscape mode\n\nis now available for iPhone and iPad. For iPhone, this is only available in Interactive mode. For iPad, you can switch to Landscape Mode at any time.\n\n\n**Landscape Mode for iPhone**\n\n*Landscape Mode for iPad\n\nLandscape Mode for iPad Pro**\n\n\n####\n Mobile Web Home\n\nThe \"Home\" page is now available in Mobile Web. This page includes trending cards, recently shared cards, new people, favorited cards, and more. The Home page experience is consistent across all platforms.\n\n\n Design\u00a0Studio updates\n\n\n The following enhancements have been made to the Design Studio:\n\n\n Notifications for users with older versions. Creative Cloud syncs version updates to users, so if users have turned off the Creative Cloud desktop sync application or if they need IT permission to upgrade, their version of Design Studio may be out of date. To accommodate this problem, a notification system has been built to identify users with older versions and instruct them on how to upgrade.\n\n\n New font selection interface. The former interface required users to type the font name into a text field. This has now been changed to a drop-down menu that populates with supported web fonts.\n\nCool new widgets, including...\n\n\n A Canadian FSA Map widget that shows data by province and FSA areas.\n\nImage and text link widgets that allow you to link to URLs on Domo's whitelist.\n\nTable Widget V2. The new table widget allows you to add sorts;\u00a0define width by pixels or points;\u00a0have alternating row colors;\u00a0and set background transparency, cell borders, and border size.\n\nGetting Help\n--------------\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by clicking\n\n*> Help Center**\n .\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://www.domo.com/university\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\ndojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo (\n\n*> Feedback**\n ).
