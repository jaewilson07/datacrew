After the DataSet has been pulled into Domo, it can only be decrypted in a Sumo table, by users who have been given special access in the\n **Data Access Management**\n settings for the DataSet. For more information about Sumo, see\n\nUnderstanding Sumo cards\n\n.\n\n\n For a white paper discussing Workbench's encryption capability, click here:\n\nWhitepaper\\_Domo+Data+Security+and+Encryption+Draft.pdf\n\nWorkbench also provides a hashing transform, which condenses information into fixed-length combinations of letters, numbers, and special characters. Unlike encryption, which allows specific users to decrypt encrypted values, hashing is irreversible. Use this transform when your data source contains columns with information you do not intend users to see.\n\n\n This article discusses encryption and hashing in turn.\n\n\n Using the Encryption Transform\n--------------------------------\n\n*To encrypt a column of data for a DataSet in Workbench 5,**\n\n. In Workbench, click\n\nin the left-hand icon bar.\n2. In the Jobs listing, double-click\u00a0the job with columns you want to encrypt.\n3. Click\n **Transforms**\n to expand that section of the pane.\n4. In the\n **Add a transform**\n menu, select\n **Encrypt Data\u00a0Transform**\n .\n5. Click the\n\nbutton.\n\n\n The\n **Encrypt Data Transform Editor**\n appears.\n6. In the\n **Encrypted Columns**\n menu, check the boxes for all columns you want to encrypt.\n7. (Optional) Turn on\n **Obfuscate Values**\n if you want\u00a0the\u00a0data in the selected columns\u00a0to be obfuscated.\n\n\n Data that is obfuscated cannot be reconstituted into a readable state.\n8. For each user who should have decryption capabilities, do the following:\n\n1. Locate the user in the\n\t **User Access**\n\t list.\n\t2. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t **Disabled**\n\t field.\n\n\n\t A\n\t **Data Password**\n\t dialog opens.\n\t3. Set\n\t **Access Enabled**\n\t to \"On.\"\n\t4. Enter a password in the\n\t **Password**\n\t field and reenter it in the\n\t **Confirm**\n\t field.\n\t5. Click\n\t **Save**\n\t .\n9. Click\n **Apply**\n when you are finished managing users.\n10. Click\n\nat the top of the pane to save your transform.\n\nThe next time you run the job, the data columns you selected will be encrypted in the DataSet in Domo.\n\n\n**To decrypt a data column you encrypted in Workbench 5,**\n\n. Open the DataSet\u00a0with the encrypted information in the Sumo card editor.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nUnderstanding Sumo cards\n\n.\n2. Click the\n\nicon on the left side of the screen.\n\nThis icon\n *only*\n appears if you have enabled decryption for this DataSet for your user following the instructions in the previous section.\n\n\n A dialog appears requesting your password.\n3. Enter the password you entered in step 5-e in the previous section.\n4. Click\n **Unlock**\n .\n\nYou must\u00a0go through this decryption process every time you access the card, even if you\u00a0save the decrypted card while in the\n **Edit**\n view.\n\n\n Using the Hash Transform\n--------------------------\n\n*To hash\u00a0a column of data for a DataSet in Workbench 5,**\n\n. In Workbench, click\n\nin the left-hand icon bar.\n2. In the Jobs listing, double-click\u00a0the job with columns you want to hash.\n3. Click\n **Transforms**\n to expand that section of the pane.\n4. In the\n **Add a transform**\n menu, select\n **Hash Value\u00a0Transform**\n .\n5. Click the\n\nbutton.\n\n\n The\n **Hash Value Transform Editor**\n appears.\n6. In the\n **Hashed Columns**\n menu, check the boxes for all columns you want to hash.\n7. Choose the desired hash algorithm.\n8. Click\n **Apply**\n when you are finished here.\n9. Click\n\nat the top of the pane to save your transform.\n\nThe next time you run the job, the data columns you selected will be converted to hash values\u00a0in the DataSet in Domo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043437413\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004834\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nEncrypting, Decrypting, and Hashing Workbench 5 Data\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,974\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:31 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "encrypting_decrypting_and_hashing_workbench_5_data", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_5", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapTGAS"}]}
