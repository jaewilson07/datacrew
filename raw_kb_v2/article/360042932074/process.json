This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Excel SFTP connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n You must have an SFTP host name, username, password, and port number to authenticate to the SFTP\u00a0server.\n\nYou must also whitelist\u00a0the following IP addresses:\n\n\n`54.208.95.237`\n\n\n`54.208.87.122`\n\n\n`54.208.95.167`\n\n\n`54.208.94.194`\n\n\n`50.207.240.162`\n\n\n`50.207.241.62`\n\n\n`52.18.90.222`\n\n\n`52.62.103.83`\n\n\n`34.198.214.100`\n\n\n Connecting to Your Excel File\n-------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Excel SFTP Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to the Excel file on an SFTP server you want to pull into Domo.
