Use Domo's comScore\u00a0MMX connector to\n\npull Media Metrix reports about key measures, media trends, target trends, and more\n\n.\n\nThe comScore connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nThis topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the comScore\u00a0MMX connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your comScore\u00a0MMX account and create a comScore DataSet, you must have a MyMetrix username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your comScore\u00a0MMX Account\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the comScore\u00a0MMX connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0comScore\u00a0MMX account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane includes a primary menu,\n **Report**\n , and other options that appear depending on the report you select.\n\n\n|\n\n*Option**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect the comScore\u00a0MMX report you want to run.
