Intro
-------

SendGrid is a cloud-based SMTP provider that allows users to send email without having to maintain email servers. Use Domo's SendGrid connector to retrieve data about your SendGrid account, such as statistics, bounces, spam reports, unsubscribes, and other information. To learn more about the SendGrid API, visit their page (

https://sendgrid.com/docs/API\_Reference/index.html

).


 You connect to your SendGrid account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SendGrid connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your SendGrid account and create a DataSet, you must have a SendGrid username and password.
