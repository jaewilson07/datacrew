To learn more about the Google Drive API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/drive/\n\n).\n\n\n You export data to Google Drive\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Drive\u00a0Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need the following:\n\n A project created in the Google Developers Console with the Google Drive\u00a0API enabled.\n* A Domo Client ID and Client Secret.\n* A Google Service Token JSON\u00a0file.\n\nThe following steps explain in detail how to create your project and obtain the needed credentials.\n\n##\n Step 1: Creating a Project in the Google Developers Console\n\nTo create a project in the Google Developers Console, do the following:\n\n. Go to\n\nhttps://console.developers.google.com\n\n.\n2. Click the dropdown arrow next to\n **My Project**\n .\n3. Click\n **New Project**\n .\n4. Name your project and select the parent folder.\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n You can also use an existing project if you want.\n\n\n###\n Step 2: Enabling the Google Drive\u00a0API\n\nTo enable the Google Sheets for your project, do the following:\n\n. In the Google Developers Console, select your project and click\n **Library**\n .\n2. Search for the Google Drive\u00a0API.\n3. Click\n **Enable**\n .\n\n\n###\n Step 3: Creating a Service Account\n\nTo create a Service Account, do the following:\n\n. In the Google Developers Console, open the\n **Credentials**\n tab.\n2. Click\n **Create credentials**\n then select\n **Service account key**\n .\n3. Select\n **New service account**\n .\n4. Name the new service account.\n5. In the\n **Role**\n dropdown, select\n **Project > Owner**\n .\n6. For the\n **Key type**\n , select\n **JSON**\n .\n7. Click\n **Create**\n , then\n **Save**\n .\n8. Select a safe location for the file, as you will need it soon.\n9. Once the file is created, click\n **Manage service accounts**\n on the far right.\n10. Copy the email address for the project you created.\n11. Log into the Google Drive account (\n\nhttps://www.google.com/drive\n\n) in which you want to save the files.\n12. Create a new Google Drive folder.\n13. Go into the new folder and share it with the email address you copied in step 10.\n14. Copy the URL into the folder, as you will need to refer to it later. It will look something like this:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TOdpy2kki8-pealAGXWwCYF8EyiwxWMW\n\n\n###\n Step 4: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret\n\nTo create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\nand log in.\n2. Click\n **New Client**\n (found under \"My Account\" in the top right corner).\n3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n\nWhen you click\n **Create**\n , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.\n4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google Drive\u00a0Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account as well as your Google Drive destination folder. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Paste the Domo client ID you copied in Step 4: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret, in the \"Prerequisites\" section above.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Paste the Domo client secret\u00a0you copied in Step 4: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret, in the \"Prerequisites\" section above.\n  |\n|\n Service Token JSON\n  |\n Paste the JSON\u00a0Service Token you generated in Step 3: Creating a Service Account, in the \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Google Drive connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Input Folder\u00a0ID\n  |\n Enter the ID of the Google Drive folder you want to push your data to (which you should have copied in Step 3: Creating a Service Account, above). This is the portion of the URL after the last\n\n/\n\n. For example, in the URL\n\n\n https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TOdpy2kki8-pealAGXWwCYF8EyiwxWMW\n\n\n , the ID is\n\n1TOdpy2kki8-pealAGXWwCYF8EyiwxWMW\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to Google Drive. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n|\n Select Filename\n  |\n Select whether you want to reference your DataSet\u00a0using the\n ****Input DataSet ID****\n or an output file name.\n  |\n|\n Filename\n  |\n Enter the output file name for your data.\n  |\n|\n Overwrite File\n  |\n Check this box if you want to overwrite existing files of the same name.\n  |\n\n\n###\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932314\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004037\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle Drive Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,719\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:19 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_drive_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
