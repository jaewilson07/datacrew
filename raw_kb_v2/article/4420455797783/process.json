Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.\n\n\n The Simba Spark JDBC Driver is used for direct SQL and HiveQL access to Apache Spark, enabling Business Intelligence (BI), analytics, and reporting on Spark-based data. Use Domo's Simba Spark JDBC connector to efficiently gain direct SQL and HiveQL access to Apache Spark.\n\nThe\n\nSimba Spark JDBC\n\nconnector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from databases using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n **Database**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nSimba Spark\n\nServer in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nSimba Spark JDBC\n\nconnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a Simba Spark database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The hostname or IP address of your database server\n* The port number of your Spark database\n* The Spark database name\n* The username and password you use to log into your Spark account\n* The\n\nthe HTTP Path\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nSimba Spark\n\nDatabase\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nSimba Spark JDBC\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n JDBC Driver\n  |\n\nSelect the JDBC driver to use.\n\n|\n|\n Server Hostname\n  |\n\nEnter the hostname or IP address of your database server.\n\n|\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the database.\n\n|\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Spark account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to log into your Spark account.\n  |\n|\n HTTP Path\n  |\n Enter the HTTP Path.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\n\nSimba Spark\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nSimba Spark JDBC\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create a query to pull data from your database.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nHiveQL Query\n\n|\n\nEnter your HiveQL query here.\n\n|\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n\nSelect the database table.\n\n|\n|\n Table Columns\n  |\n\nSelect the table columns.\n\n|\n|\n Fetch Size\n  |\n\nEnter the fetch size for memory performance. The default value will be used if no fetch size is specified. If an \"out of memory\" error occurs, retry decreasing the fetch size.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4420455797783\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003847\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSimba Spark JDBC Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,741\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "simba_spark_jdbc_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
