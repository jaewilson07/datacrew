Intro
-------

You can use the
 **Save As**
 option to duplicate a Card to create a new instance of that Card that can be manipulated separately from the original Card. This is different from the

Copy

functionality because Cards that are copied are still linked—if you make a change to a copy, the original and any other copies receive the same changes. You can change the name and underlying data of the duplicate, and the original stays the same. When you duplicate a Card, you are assigned as the owner of the new instance of the Card.


 To duplicate a Card, you must have an Editor, Privileged, or Admin security role, or a custom role with the Edit Cards grant enabled.

*Note:**
 If a Page has been locked, you can only move or copy Cards if you are the Page owner or you have an Admin default security role or a custom role with Manage All Cards and Pages grant enabled. For more information about locking and unlocking content on Pages, see

Managing Custom Roles

.

You can also duplicate multiple Cards at once in the Admin Settings. You must have an Admin security role to use this feature. For more information about security roles, see

Security Role Reference

.
