Domoâ€™s Magic ETL is now more performant, more feature-rich, and more consistent. Magic ETL v2 is broadly compatible with Magic ETL v1; most existing transforms can be upgraded frictionlessly. You must upgrade Magic ETL for each DataFlow. You can find detailed instructions for that process below.

*Important:**
 There are significant behavioral changes in Magic ETL which may affect your DataFlows. Learn about them in

before upgrading.

**Important:**
 After you upgrade a DataFlow, the toggle will no longer be available and you cannot revert to Magic ETL v1.
