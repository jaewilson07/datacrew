This article lists the most common problems users have when adding Beast Mode calculations in Domo and provides suggestions for resolving these issues.

. *Case statement formatting*


 A case statement requires a few keywords placed in a particular order.

CASE


 WHEN `State` = 'California'


 THEN 'CA'


 ELSE `State`


 END`


 The case statement will error out if it doesn’t include these elements or if it is not written correctly.


 You can include as many
 `WHEN`
 conditions as you would like but must have a
 `THEN`
 for every
 `WHEN.`


`CASE


 WHEN `State` = 'California'


 THEN 'CA'


 WHEN `State` = 'Washington'


 THEN 'WA'


 ELSE `State`


 END`

. *Date formatting*


 The functions you can use are

DATE\_FORMAT()

and

STR\_TO\_DATE()

. When using the

STR


 \_TO\_DATE()

function you must use the exact same format your string column is already in so that the function can properly convert it to a date type.


 You have a string type column,`Date`, that needs to be converted to a date type. The format of your values is MM-DD-YYYY.


`STR_TO_DATE(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')`


 If your values are formatted as YY/DD/MM, then use


`STR_TO-DATE(`Date`,'%y/%d/%m')`


 Once you have a date type column, and you would like to change the format, use the

date\_format()

function. This function can accept and generate any date format needed.


 Your `Date` column is formatted as DD-MM-YY, but you would like to see it as MM-DD-YYYY


`DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')`


 For more information on which date format specifiers to use, such as
 `%m`
 or
 `%y`
 , see

.
3. *Use of Field name ( ` ) vs String Value ( ‘ ) vs Numeric Value.*


 In Beast Modes, the actual field name is referenced using the back tick ( ` ). Inputting a hard string value requires the single quotes ( ‘ ), whereas referencing a numeric value requires no quotes at all.


`CASE WHEN `Return Customer?` = 'Y' THEN 1


 WHEN `Return Customer?` = 'N' THEN 0


 END`


**Note:**
 Putting single quotes (') around numeric values will
 *not*
 result in an error, rather it will just output the 1's and 0's as a string type column.
4. *Strings compared to Dates*


 When using the

DATE\_FORMAT()

function, this will convert the value to a
 `varchar`
 datatype, also known as a string. This is problematic because you are no longer able to use the value as a date for comparisons, etc. If your column should be a
 `date`
 format after using the

DATE\_FORMAT()

function, then you need to use

STR\_TO\_DATE()

to convert it back to a date type.


 Using the following beastmode, the output would be a string type column.


`DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')`


 To convert the string to a date, we would want to wrap our entire beastmode in the

STR\_TO\_DATE()

function.


`STR_TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y'),'%m-%d-%Y')`


 In the case that you will have a string column that needs to be converted to a date column and you want it formatted differently, you will need to do the following:


`STR_TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(`Date`,'%y-%m-%d'),'%m-%d-%Y'),'%m-%d-%Y')`


 Because it works from the inside out, the
 ``Date``
 column, which is formatted as YY-MM-DD is first converted to a date. We would like to see the column as a MM-DD-YYYY format, so we then use
 `DATE_FORMAT()`
 to do so. However, now we are left with a string type column. Lastly, we will use the

STR


 \_TO\_DATE()

function to bring it back to a date type.
5. *Use of Trim function*


 Many times, strings will leave unwanted spaces at the end or beginning of the value. This is problematic when using formulas that call out the exact value. The
 `trim()`
 function will trim off any unnecessary white space.


 The `Zipcode` column contains values that have white space, such as '12345   '. Knowing white space exists in your values is extremely important if you are, for example, using the
 `COUNT()`
 function.
 `COUNT()`
 will count the number of characters in a string including white space. By using the
 `trim()`
 function first, you ensure that you count only the actual number of characters in your `Zipcode` values.


`COUNT(TRIM(`Zipcode`))`
