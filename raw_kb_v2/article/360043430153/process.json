When using the\n\nSTR\n\n\n \\_TO\\_DATE()\n\nfunction you must use the exact same format your string column is already in so that the function can properly convert it to a date type.\n\n\n You have a string type column,`Date`, that needs to be converted to a date type. The format of your values is MM-DD-YYYY.\n\n\n`STR_TO_DATE(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')`\n\n\n If your values are formatted as YY/DD/MM, then use\n\n\n`STR_TO-DATE(`Date`,'%y/%d/%m')`\n\n\n Once you have a date type column, and you would like to change the format, use the\n\ndate\\_format()\n\nfunction. This function can accept and generate any date format needed.\n\n\n Your `Date` column is formatted as DD-MM-YY, but you would like to see it as MM-DD-YYYY\n\n\n`DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')`\n\n\n For more information on which date format specifiers to use, such as\n `%m`\n or\n `%y`\n , see\n\nDate Format Specifier Characters in Beast Mode\n\n.\n3. *Use of Field name ( ` ) vs String Value ( \u2018 ) vs Numeric Value.*\n\n\n In Beast Modes, the actual field name is referenced using the back tick ( ` ). Inputting a hard string value requires the single quotes ( \u2018 ), whereas referencing a numeric value requires no quotes at all.\n\n\n`CASE WHEN `Return Customer?` = 'Y' THEN 1\n\n\n WHEN `Return Customer?` = 'N' THEN 0\n\n\n END`\n\n\n**Note:**\n Putting single quotes (') around numeric values will\n *not*\n result in an error, rather it will just output the 1's and 0's as a string type column.\n4. *Strings compared to Dates*\n\n\n When using the\n\nDATE\\_FORMAT()\n\nfunction, this will convert the value to a\n `varchar`\n datatype, also known as a string. This is problematic because you are no longer able to use the value as a date for comparisons, etc. If your column should be a\n `date`\n format\u00a0after using the\n\nDATE\\_FORMAT()\n\nfunction, then you need to use\n\nSTR\\_TO\\_DATE()\n\nto convert it back to a date type.\n\n\n Using the following beastmode, the output would be a string type column.\n\n\n`DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')`\n\n\n To convert the string to a date, we would want to wrap our entire beastmode\u00a0in the\n\nSTR\\_TO\\_DATE()\n\nfunction.\n\n\n`STR_TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y'),'%m-%d-%Y')`\n\n\n In the case\u00a0that you will have a string column that needs to be converted to a date column and you\u00a0want it formatted differently, you will need to do the following:\n\n\n`STR_TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(`Date`,'%y-%m-%d'),'%m-%d-%Y'),'%m-%d-%Y')`\n\n\n Because it works from the inside out, the\n ``Date``\n column, which is formatted as YY-MM-DD is first converted to a date. We would like to see the column as a MM-DD-YYYY format, so we then use\n `DATE_FORMAT()`\n to do so. However, now we are left with a string type column. Lastly, we will use the\n\nSTR\n\n\n \\_TO\\_DATE()\n\nfunction\u00a0to bring it back to a date type.\n5. *Use of Trim function*\n\n\n Many times, strings will leave unwanted spaces at the end or beginning of the value. This is problematic when using formulas that call out the exact value. The\n `trim()`\n function will trim off any unnecessary white space.\n\n\n The `Zipcode` column contains values that have white space, such as '12345\u00a0 \u00a0'. Knowing white space exists in your values is extremely important if you are, for example, using the\n `COUNT()`\n function.\n `COUNT()`\n will count the number of characters in a string including white space. By using the\n `trim()`\n function first, you ensure that you count only the actual number of characters in your `Zipcode` values.\n\n\n`COUNT(TRIM(`Zipcode`))`\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043430153\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004077\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nTop 5 Issues Users Experience with Beast Mode in Domo\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 6,525\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:20 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "top_5_issues_users_experience_with_beast_mode_in_domo", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "beast_mode", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanAGAS"}]}
