This is problematic because you are no longer able to use the value as a date for comparisons, etc. If your column should be a\n                          \n                           date\n                          \n                          format\u00a0after using the\n                          \n                           DATE_FORMAT()\n                          \n                          function, then you need to use\n                          \n                           STR_TO_DATE()\n                          \n                          to convert it back to a date type.\n                          \n\n                          Using the following beastmode, the output would be a string type column.\n                          \n\n\n                           DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y')\n                          \n\n\n                          To convert the string to a date, we would want to wrap our entire beastmode\u00a0in the\n                          \n                           STR_TO_DATE()\n                          \n                          function.\n                          \n\n\n                           STR_TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(`Date`,'%m-%d-%Y'),'%m-%d-%Y')\n                          \n\n\n                          In the case\u00a0that you will have a string column that needs to be converted to a date column and you\u00a0want it formatted differently, you will need to do the following:\n                          \n\n\n                           STR_TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(`Date`,'%y-%m-%d'),'%m-%d-%Y'),'%m-%d-%Y')\n                          \n\n\n\n                          Because it works from the inside out, the\n                          \n                           `Date`\n                          \n                          column, which is formatted as YY-MM-DD is first converted to a date. We would like to see the column as a MM-DD-YYYY format, so we then use\n                          \n                           DATE_FORMAT()\n                          \n                          to do so. However, now we are left with a string type column. Lastly, we will use the\n                          \n                           STR\n                          \n\n                           _TO_DATE()\n                          \n                          function\u00a0to bring it back to a date type.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Use of Trim function\n                          \n\n\n                          Many times, strings will leave unwanted spaces at the end or beginning of the value. This is problematic when using formulas that call out the exact value. The\n                          \n                           trim()\n                          \n                          function will trim off any unnecessary white space.\n                          \n\n                          The `Zipcode` column contains values that have white space, such as '12345\u00a0 \u00a0'. Knowing white space exists in your values is extremely important if you are, for example, using the\n                          \n                           COUNT()\n                          \n                          function.\n                          \n                           COUNT()\n                          \n                          will count the number of characters in a string including white space. By using the\n                          \n                           trim()\n                          \n                          function first, you ensure that you count only the actual number of characters in your `Zipcode` values.\n                          \n\n\n                           COUNT(TRIM(`Zipcode`))", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360043430153", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
