Use Domo's VoiceStorm connector to retrieve lists of liked comments, leaderboards, posts, users, and more. To learn more about the VoiceStorm API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://dev.voicestorm.com/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your VoiceStorm account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the VoiceStorm connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your VoiceStorm account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A VoiceStorm API token\n* A VoiceStorm token secret\n* Your VoiceStorm company domain\n\nTo obtain an API token and token secret, ask your VoiceStorm customer service account manager for API keys (which are necessary for you to access the REST API platform). The API keys include the API token and token secret.\n\n\n You can find your VoiceStorm company domain by looking at the portion of your VoiceStorm URL immediately following\n\nhttps://\n\n. For example, if the URL was\n\n\n https://mycompany.voicestorm.com/v1\n\n\n , the domain would be\n\nmycompany\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your VoiceStorm Account\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the VoiceStorm Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your VoiceStorm account.
