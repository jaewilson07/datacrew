This allows you to upload your data that contains PII data with the information redacted so that it is never stored in Domo. For more information on PII, see\n                        \n                         What Constitutes PII?\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Privacy compliance is accomplished through a process called Poly-Anonymization\u2122. Poly-Anonymization involves taking any personal identifying pieces of information (name, gender, address, social security number, etc.) and swapping it out for an anonymous value (Poly-ID). This value is unique, inconsistent, unpredictable, and not hashed. After data anonymization has been completed, organizations can share the resulting data either internally or externally without the usual risk that would be associated with such activity. For more information on this process and on Anonomatic, visit their site\n                        \n                         https://anonomatic.com\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         Video - PII Vault Plugin For Domo Workbench - Introduction and Overview\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Try it out\n                       \n\n                        In order to test the PII Vault Protection and Compliance feature with Domo, you need to do the following:\n                       \n\n\n                         Create an Anonomatic Trial account.\n                        \n\n                         Download the Workbench plugin.\n                        \n\n\n                        This free trial will let you upload 2,000 unique personal profiles and will last for 30 days.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             This feature is available\n                             \n                              on demand and paid\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            To request this feature be enabled,\n                           \n\n\n\n                              Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager, Technical Consultant, or Account Executive.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              If you do not have contact information for your CSM, TC, or AE, contact Technical Support.
