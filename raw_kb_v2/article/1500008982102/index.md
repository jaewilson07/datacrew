General retake policy
-----------------------

By default, each exam purchase comes with two attempts. If a passing score is not achieved after the first attempt, there is no waiting period before a user can use their second attempt.


 If a candidate fails to achieve a passing score after the second attempt, the certification exam must be purchased again to unlock another two attempts.


 There is no limit to the number of exam purchases that can be made.


**Tip:**
 Domo strongly recommends reviewing the training topics suggested after failing the first attempt before attempting the retake.
