This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Jive connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Jive account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Jive username and password\n* Your Jive URL (e.g.\n\n\n https://community.jivesoftware.com\n\n\n )\n\nConnecting to Your Jive Account\n---------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Jive Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Jive account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center.
