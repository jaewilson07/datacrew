They are usually used in scientific applications, especially physics, in which they often show energy inputs, useful output, and wasted output. However, they are often used in business as well, especially in showing cost breakdowns, inventory flows, web traffic, and more.\n                       \n\n                        In a Sankey chart, items are connected to other items using colored lines or arrows. Each pairing has a value. The thickness of any connecting line is determined by the value of the pairing in comparison to other values found in the dataset. For example, if point A was connected to point B and had a value of 10,000, and this value was among the greater values in the dataset, the line would appear thick. On the other hand, if the value of 10,000 was among the smaller values in the dataset, it would appear thin.\n                       \n\n                        The following screenshot shows an example of a publicly available Sankey chart. This chart shows both production and imports of various fuel sources and their total final consumption for the country of Iceland. Note that the line for the production of geothermal energy is far larger than the others (indicated by the thick brown connector line).\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        This screenshot was taken from the World Balance website at\n                        \n                         iea.org\n                        \n                        (International Energy Agency), which shows energy production and consumption for most nations in the world.

It was created by Ben Schmidt, a professor of history at Northeastern University.\n                       \n\n                        Powering Sankey charts\n                       \n\n                        A Sankey chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet\u2014one for the \"From\" column, one for the \"To\" column, and one for the values corresponding to each pairing. The items in the \"From\" column appear on the left side of the chart, and the items in the \"To\" column appear on the right side. For information about the different kinds of data in a chart, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        At minimum, a Sankey chart contains two groupings\u2014an \"input\" grouping on the left and an \"output\" grouping on the right. In this simple version of the chart, input items connect to one or more output items, but the output items themselves do not connect to other output items. So item A might connect to items B, C, and D, but B, C, and D would not have their own connections. This is exemplified in the following simple DataSet showing the flow of money between different nations. Note that all countries in the \"From\" column are paired with another country in the \"To\" category, but the \"To\" countries do not have their own connections; they are \"dead ends\" in the data.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        When this DataSet is visualized, the resulting chart looks something like the following, with direct connections between the input and output countries; no intermediary countries appear in the flow.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        You can also have a more complex chart, with multiple output groupings. You can do this by structuring your data so that output items that should have their own connections are shown in both the \"From\" and \"To\" columns. In the following example DataSet, all intermediary countries (i.e. those that receive money as well as send it to others) appear in both the \"To\"\n                        \n                         and\n                        \n                        \"From\" columns. For example, Portugal receives payment from Brazil, and Angola, China, and Japan receive payment from Portugal. Therefore, Portugal is represented in both the \"To\" and \"From\" columns.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        When this DataSet is visualized, the resulting chart looks something like the following, with an intermediary group both receiving input and sending output:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Notes:\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               When structuring your data for a Sankey chart, make sure you do not make bidirectional connections between items. For example, if you had \"Brazil\" in your \"From\" column and \"Portugal\" in the corresponding \"To\" column, you could not also have \"Portugal\" in the \"From\" column and \"Brazil\" in the corresponding \"To\" column. Otherwise, you will get a \"Circular reference detected\" error and the chart preview will not load.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n                              If your \"From\" and \"To\" columns contain duplicate items, make sure the names are spelled the same, including any punctuation and spaces. Otherwise, the items will be considered distinct from each other and they will not be considered both input and output items.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        In the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Sankey chart.
