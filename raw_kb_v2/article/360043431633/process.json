You can use Domo\u2019s Moz connector to retrieve data for a variety of metrics, such as URL, link, and anchor text metrics.\u00a0To learn more about\u00a0the Mozscape API, go to\n\nhttps://moz.com/help/guides/moz-api/mozscape\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n The user interface for building this connector is not yet available in our Connectors listing in the Data Center, meaning you will not be able to configure the connector on your own. However, we at Domo are more than happy to configure the connector for you so you can begin using it to pull your data into Domo. Please don't hesitate to reach out to your CSM or Domo Support. For contact information, see\n\n\n Getting Help\n\n\n .\n\n\n You connect to your Moz account in the Data Center.
