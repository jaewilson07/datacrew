You connect to your Facebook Atlas account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Facebook Atlas connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Facebook Atlas account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The name of the user who will have access to your Facebook Atlas data.\n* The application ID for the app that you created to access your Facebook Atlas account.\n* The application secret\u00a0for the app that you created to access your Facebook Atlas account.\n\nConnecting to Your Facebook Atlas Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Facebook Atlas Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Facebook Atlas account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Application ID\n  |\n Enter the application ID for the app that you created to access your Facebook Atlas account.\n  |\n|\n Application Secret\n  |\n Enter the application\u00a0secret for the app that you created to access your Facebook Atlas account.\n  |\n|\n User Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the user who will have access to your Facebook Atlas data.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Facebook Atlas credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Facebook Atlas DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with other menus for configuring your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Facebook Atlas report you want to run.

The DataSet will retrieve the data from the most recent execution of the report.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDataSets should be set to update once a day.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042926774\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003765\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nFacebook Atlas Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,631\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "facebook_atlas_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
