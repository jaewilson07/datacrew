 FAQs
------


####
 Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?

You need to create an application that is authorized to read your Facebook Atlas data and a Facebook account that is authorized by that application.

###
 How do I get my Atlas reports to show up in Domo?

Domo can return data from a report that you have created in Facebook Atlas if it is configured to run automatically and returns the data in CSV format. The DataSet will retrieve the data from the most recent execution of the report.

###
 How often can the data be updated?

DataSets should be set to update once a day.

###
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

No.
