(\n\nhttps://developer.sprinklr.com/\n\n).\n\n\n The Sprinklr connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Sprinklr account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Sprinklr\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Sprinklr allows an organization to aggregate their various social platform accounts into one place and track social media KPIs.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Engagements (ie, Facebook Likes, Twitter Loves, LinkedIn Shares)\n* Reach\n* Impressions\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Social marketers\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Application process to access the API could take 2 weeks. Actual implementation time once authenticated takes about 5 hours.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 7\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nMany of the report options require manual configuration. More information about these options can be found in the API documentation. For example, the \"Account Insights,\" \"Post Insights,\" and \"Paid Ad Stats Insights\" reports require you to fill in a\n\ngroupby\n\nfield. Whatever you enter in this field becomes the dimensions in the report. Available columns that can be used in the\n\ngroupby\n\nare listed in the API documentation. The connector tool tips demonstrate the appropriate format that is required for each configuration step.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Sprinklr account and create a DataSet, you must have a Sprinklr\u00a0client ID and client secret.\n\n\n To get access to the API, you must submit an application and be approved by Sprinklr. Steps to complete this application process can be found here:\n\nhttps://developer.sprinklr.com/apps/myapps\n\nYou must also set up a redirect\\_uri to\n\n\n*https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/sprinklr/exchange*\n\n\n when creating the API key.\n\n\n Once access is confirmed, you will be able to authenticate using your client ID and client secret.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Sprinklr Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Sprinklr\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Credentials Pane**\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Sprinklr\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Environment\n  |\n Select the Sprinklr environment you want to pull data from, either production or sandbox.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Sprinklr client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Sprinklr client secret.\n  |\n\nFor more information about authentication, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0Sprinklr credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Sprinklr\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu in which you select a report type, along with various other menus and fields which may appear depending on the selected report type.\n\n\n**Menu**\n |\n**Description**\n |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Sprinklr report.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Insights\n  |\n Returns account-level information.\n  |\n|\n Bootstrap Info\n  |\n Returns static data for various resources.\n  |\n|\n Custom Metric Information\n  |\n Returns information about user-defined custom metrics.\n  |\n|\n Dashboard Column\n  |\n Returns details on the requested monitoring dashboard column.\n  |\n|\n Paid Ad Stat Insights\n  |\n Returns statistics about paid ads.\n  |\n|\n Post Insights\n  |\n Returns insights for the published brand posts.\n\n\n For a list of acceptable columns for this report, see\n\nhttps://developer.sprinklr.com/docs/read/developr/objects/reports/Post\\_Insights\\_Report\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Profile Conversion Data\n  |\n Returns messages in a conversation for a given user ID.\n  |\n|\n Profile Details\n  |\n Returns the profile details of the requested social profile.\n  |\n|\n Listening Stream\n  |\n Returns the message stream associated with each messag.e\n  |\n|\n Listening Topic Configuration\n  |\n Returns the list of all available configured topic groups and topics.

Each report in Sprinklr is filtered and run on a separate query that cleans the Sprinklr data displayed in the reports on the Sprinklr website. When setting up the connector, you\n *must*\n use these same filters;\u00a0otherwise,\u00a0data will be duplicated or missing. To do this, you must\u00a0use the API call that is in the backend of a Sprinklr Report.\n\n\n To access this code or to find the filters and backend report to pull from the connector, do the following:\n\n. Open\u00a0the Chrome browser.\n2. Right-click in the browser and select\n **Inspect**\n .\n3. In the developer screen, navigate to the\n **Network**\n tab.\n4. Refresh your screen on the Sprinklr report page.\n\n\n This causes\u00a0several elements to\u00a0appear under the\n **Name**\n column.\n5. Search through the queries\u00a0and find the corresponding report or data you want\u00a0to replicate.\n6. Select the query and search under\n **requests**\n to find all the inputs you need to enter into the Domo Connector.\n7. Connect to the Sprinklr\u00a0connector to Domo using your credentials.\n8. Select the report used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr this is found under\n **requests >**\n**parameter**\n .\u00a0In the sample it is\u00a0called \u201cPost Insights.\u201d\n9. For\n **Aggregation Function**\n , select the function used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr this is found under\n **groupBys\u00a0>**\n**p**\n**rojections**\n . In the sample it is called\n **SUM**\n .\n10. For\n **Measurement**\n**Name**\n , select the function used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr this is found under\n **groupbys\u00a0>\u00a0projections >\u00a0measurement**\n .\u00a0 In the sample it is called\n **TOTAL\\_ENGAGEMENT**\n .\n11. For\n **Group By Options,**\n enter the\n **groupby**\n fields found in the Sprinklr report under the\n **Requests**\n dropdown menu in the\n **Network**\n tab, using the syntax\n\n(columnName,dimensionName,groupType,detail=value).\n\nFor example, if I had the \u201cClient\\_ID\u201d field listed in the group, I would use the following syntax for\n **Group By Options**\n :\n\n(Client\\_ID,Client\\_ID, field)\n\n.\n\n\n We also recommend you\u00a0use a date group by even though the Sprinklr report may not contain that information, so the Domo cards will render the data in the needed format.\u00a0For example:\n\n(date,DATE\\_HISTOGRAM,interval=1h)\n\nor\n\n(POST\\_PUBLISHED\\_DATE,FIELD)\n12. For\n **Filters**\n , enter the filters\u00a0used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr these are found under\n **requests > filters**\n .\u00a0 Use the syntax under ? that you find by the\n **Filters**\n box.\n13. (Conditional) If the query code in the Sprinklr report states\u00a0that\n **Columns to Expand**\n and\n **Measurement**\n**Options**\n are being used, enter the info that is included in the \u201crequest\u201d data.\n14. When configuring the time frame, use the time frame stated in the actual Sprinklr report/graph or the one\u00a0needed for your card visualization. For most Sprinklr reports in Domo, no time frame is provided in\u00a0the actual Sprinklr report .\u00a0You can see in the backend that the\u00a0time stated in the\n\n\n**Time**\n\n\n filter is in a format that is not database friendly or recognizable as a date.\n\nBuilding Drilldown\n--------------------\n\nTo create drilldown\u00a0in your Sprinklr data, design or find the type of drilldown you wish to see in your card and create a new Sprinklr\u00a0DataSet\u00a0that shows that data. For the drilldown to work, you will need to pull or rename the same field names in a DataFlow that correspond with the top level Sprinklr data source.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDataSets should be set to update once a day.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nSprinklr limits calls to Production instances to 5 calls per second and 500 per hour.\u00a0Calls to Sandbox instances are limited to 2 calls per second and 100 per hour.\u00a0Note that a single DataSet run may require multiple calls.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043431993\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003700\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSprinklr Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,870\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "sprinklr_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
