To learn more about the AdSense\u00a0API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/adsense\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Google AdSense account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google AdSense connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to\u00a0a\u00a0Google AdSense\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the password for the Google account you want to connect to.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Google AdSense Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google AdSense Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Google AdSense connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Google accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can enter your Google credentials. Once you have entered valid Google credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google AdSense DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Google\u00a0when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Google.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains various menus in which you can configure your Google AdSense report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Metrics\n  |\n Select up to 100 metrics for your Google AdSense report.\n  |\n|\n Dimensions\n  |\n Select up to 100 dimensions for your Google AdSense report.\n  |\n|\n From (Start) Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to begin pulling in report data for. Pair with\n **End Days**\n to create a range of days for the report. For example, if you entered\n\n14\n\nfor\n **Start Days**\n and\n\n7\n\nfor\n **End Days**\n , each time your report ran it would pull data from the past\n\n14\n\ndays until the past\n\n7\n\ndays.\n  |\n|\n To (End) Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to stoplling in report data for. Pair with\n **Start Days**\n to create a range of days for the report. For example, if you entered\n\n14\n\nfor\n **Start Days**\n and\n\n7\n\nfor\n **End Days**\n , each time your report ran it would pull data from the past\n\n14\n\ndays until the past\n\n7\n\ndays.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n How do I know my Google\u00a0credentials are secure?\n\nThe connector uses OAuth, which authenticates the account with Google without Domo ever having to access your Google account credentials.\n\n###\n I am not able to create an account because the account information never loads. How can I create an account?\n\nYour ad blocker is blocking the AdSense account information. Open an incognito window in Chrome and try again.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043431273\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003768\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle AdSense Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,640\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_adsense_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
