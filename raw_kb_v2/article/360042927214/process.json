The users who are not enabled with Salesforce SSO by\n **February 15, 2021**\n will lose the ability to log into Pardot until they are connected to a Salesforce user.\n\n\n* Beginning on\n **February 15, 2021**\n , you will need to use Domo\u2019s Salesforce Pardot Connector with Single Sign-On Support (com.domo.Connector.pardot.oauth) to create new DataSets for Pardot.\n* Current DataSets using Domo\u2019s Salesforce Pardot Connector (com.domo.Connector.pardot) will need to be migrated to the Single Sign-On version by\n **February 15, 2021**\n to prevent disruptions of service.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nSalesforce Pardot to Salesforce\u00a0Pardot SSO Connector Migration\n\n.\n\nSalesforce Pardot is a marketing automation SaaS company that develops automated marketing and demand generation software and services for business-to-business marketers. To learn more about the Salesforce Pardot API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://developer.pardot.com/\n\n). Both versions 3 and 4 are implemented in this connector.\n\n\n The Salesforce Pardot connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Salesforce Pardot account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Salesforce Pardot\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Results of email marketing activities\n* Lead generation success\n* Response to specific campaigns\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Response rate to email marketing\n* Number of leads generated\n* Response rate\n* Conversion rate\n* Open rate\n* Click rate\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Email marketing analyst\n* CMO\n* Creative director\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Use Append to pull only the data modified or created since the last run to limit the number of calls.\n* When pulling deleted prospects, use the\n **Updated date**\n filter since this is\u00a0the date that is modified when a prospect is deleted in Pardot.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Salesforce Pardot account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Salesforce Pardot username and password.\n* Your Salesforce Pardot user key.\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, visit\n\nhttp://developer.pardot.com.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Salesforce Pardot Account\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Salesforce Pardot Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Salesforce Pardot account.

In that case, Pardot returns \"Client IP address/location must be activated before accessing API.\"\u00a0If that happens, Domo IP addresses must be whitelisted. For more information, see\n\nhttp://help.pardot.com/customer/port...ion-activation\n\n.\n* Pardot requires a very specific \"dictionary\" to decipher its results. The connector returns codes specific to every implementation. The mapping of codes to definitions requires significant maintenance.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042927214\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003721\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSalesforce Pardot Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,819\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "salesforce_pardot_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
