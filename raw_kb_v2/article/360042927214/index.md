**Important:**
 Beginning on
 **February 15, 2021**
 , Pardot’s user authentication system will be discontinued and all users will be required to use Salesforce Single Sign-On (SSO). The users who are not enabled with Salesforce SSO by
 **February 15, 2021**
 will lose the ability to log into Pardot until they are connected to a Salesforce user.


* Beginning on
 **February 15, 2021**
 , you will need to use Domo’s Salesforce Pardot Connector with Single Sign-On Support (com.domo.Connector.pardot.oauth) to create new DataSets for Pardot.
* Current DataSets using Domo’s Salesforce Pardot Connector (com.domo.Connector.pardot) will need to be migrated to the Single Sign-On version by
 **February 15, 2021**
 to prevent disruptions of service.

Salesforce Pardot is a marketing automation SaaS company that develops automated marketing and demand generation software and services for business-to-business marketers. To learn more about the Salesforce Pardot API, visit their page (

http://developer.pardot.com/

). Both versions 3 and 4 are implemented in this connector.


 The Salesforce Pardot connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Salesforce Pardot account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Salesforce Pardot connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Best Practices
----------------


* Use Append to pull only the data modified or created since the last run to limit the number of calls.
* When pulling deleted prospects, use the
 **Updated date**
 filter since this is the date that is modified when a prospect is deleted in Pardot.

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Salesforce Pardot account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Salesforce Pardot username and password.
* Your Salesforce Pardot user key.

For information about obtaining these credentials, visit

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Some Pardot accounts may have IP security enabled. In that case, Pardot returns "Client IP address/location must be activated before accessing API." If that happens, Domo IP addresses must be whitelisted. For more information, see

http://help.pardot.com/customer/port...ion-activation

.
* Pardot requires a very specific "dictionary" to decipher its results. The connector returns codes specific to every implementation. The mapping of codes to definitions requires significant maintenance.
