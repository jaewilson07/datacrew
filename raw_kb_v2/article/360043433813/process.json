Dive in to your team's activities, Projects and Tasks, DataSets, Buzz conversations, and more to find insights and shape your company\u2019s Domo experience.\n\n\n You must have an Admin security role to access the DomoStats Connector or to connect to the DomoStats apps. However, once the DataSets have been created or the app has been deployed, they can be shared with anyone in your organization.\n\n\n You import DomoStats DataSets in the\n **Data Center**\n . This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DomoStats Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo pull in DomoStats DataSets using this Connector, you must have Admin security access. No credentials are required for connecting.\n\n\n Connecting to DomoStats DataSets\n----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Details**\n pane\u00a0in the DomoStats Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a single\n **Report**\n menu from which you select your desired DomoStats DataSet.\n\n **Report**  | **Description**  |\n|\n Accounts\n  |\n Returns information about the Accounts that are in the instance.\n  |\n|\n Accounts with Permissions\n  |\n Returns information about the Accounts that are in the instance and what users have access to them.\n  |\n|\n Activity Log\n  |\n Returns information about team member activities within Domo such as logins, card creation, card viewing, DataSet creation, etc.\n\n\n See\n\nActivity Log\n\n\n DataSet\n\nbelow.\n  |\n|\n AutoML Training Jobs\n  |\n Included with data science package.\n  |\n|\n Beast Modes used in Cards\n  |\n Returns information about which Beast Modes are currently in use in cards.\n  |\n|\n Buzz\n  |\n Returns information about Buzz usage within Domo such as conversation participants, number of messages posted, etc.\n  |\n|\n Card Datasource\n  |\n Returns the DataSets that power a card.\n  |\n|\n Card Pages\n  |\n Returns the dashboards where a card displays.\n  |\n|\n Card Permissions\n  |\n Returns information about card permissions.\n\n\n See\n\nCard Permissions DataSet\n\nbelow.\n  |\n|\n DataFlow Input DataSources\n  |\n Returns the IDs of inputs to DataFlows.\n  |\n|\n DataFlow Output DataSources\n  |\n Returns the IDs of outputs from DataFlows.\n  |\n|\n DataFlows\n  |\n Returns information about DataFlows within your Domo\u00a0instance, such as DataFlow name, type, status, last updated date, etc.\n\n\n See\n\nDataFlows DataSet\n\nbelow.\n  |\n|\n DataFlows History\n  |\n Returns DataFlow run history information for your Domo instance, such as DataFlow name, run start and end time, whether runs were successful, etc.\n\n\n See\n\nDataFlows History DataSet\n\nbelow.\n\n\n**Note:**\n This report may have up to a 24-hour window without data.

This helps keep DataSets organized and accessible.\n\n\n 1. In the navigation header, select\n **Data**\n .\n\n\n 2. Select\n **DataSets**\n from the\n\nnavigation rail.\n\n3. In the\n **Search**\n bar, type the name of your DataSet. You\n\n\n can also locate DataSets using filters.\n\n\n 3. In the\n **Search**\n bar, select\n **Add Filter**\n .\n\n4. Choose\n **Type**\n and enter\n **DomoStats**\n .\n\n\n A list of DomoStats DataSets will generate. Choose your DataSet from the list.\n\n###\n Tagging a DomoStats DataSet\n\nLocating and organizing your DataSets is made possible by tagging. Tagging groups the DataSets in collections that can be found using the\n **Tag**\n filter.\n\n\n 1. Locate the DataSet in Domo. (See the previous section, Locating DomoStats DataSets, for a step-by-step guide.)\n\n\n 2. Select\n **+ Add Tag**\n under the DataSet's name.\n\n3. Choose from the list of available tags, or create a new tag using the search feature.\n\n4. Select\n **+**\n next to\n **Create new tag.**\n\n\n 5. Select\n **Save.**\n\nThe DataSet is now tagged and can be\u00a0found using the Tags filter.\n\nDataSet Fields\n----------------\n\nThis section gives field-by-field descriptions for certain DomoStats reports DataSets.\n\n###\n Activity Log DataSet\n\n\n| **Field**  | **Description**  |\n|\n Object\\_Name\n  |\n The name of the object that received an action.\n  |\n|\n User\\_ID\n  |\n The ID of the person or thing that performed an action.\n  |\n|\n Source\\_ID\n  |\n The ID of the type.
