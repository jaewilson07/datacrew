Intro
-------

The DomoStats Connector gives you the freedom to explore how your team is using Domo. Dive in to your team's activities, Projects and Tasks, DataSets, Buzz conversations, and more to find insights and shape your company’s Domo experience.


 You must have an Admin security role to access the DomoStats Connector or to connect to the DomoStats apps. However, once the DataSets have been created or the app has been deployed, they can be shared with anyone in your organization.


 You import DomoStats DataSets in the
 **Data Center**
 . This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DomoStats Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To pull in DomoStats DataSets using this Connector, you must have Admin security access. No credentials are required for connecting.


 Connecting to DomoStats DataSets

 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Details**
 pane in the DomoStats Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,

###
 Locating DomoStats DataSets

After a DataSet is created, you can locate the DataSet through filters and tagging. This helps keep DataSets organized and accessible.


 1. In the navigation header, select
 **Data**
 .


 2. Select
 **DataSets**
 from the

navigation rail.

3. In the
 **Search**
 bar, type the name of your DataSet. You


 can also locate DataSets using filters.


 3. In the
 **Search**
 bar, select
 **Add Filter**
 .

4. Choose
 **Type**
 and enter
 **DomoStats**
 .


 A list of DomoStats DataSets will generate. Choose your DataSet from the list.

###
 Tagging a DomoStats DataSet

Locating and organizing your DataSets is made possible by tagging. Tagging groups the DataSets in collections that can be found using the
 **Tag**
 filter.


 1. Locate the DataSet in Domo. (See the previous section, Locating DomoStats DataSets, for a step-by-step guide.)


 2. Select
 **+ Add Tag**
 under the DataSet's name.

3. Choose from the list of available tags, or create a new tag using the search feature.

4. Select
 **+**
 next to
 **Create new tag.**


 5. Select
 **Save.**

The DataSet is now tagged and can be found using the Tags filter.
