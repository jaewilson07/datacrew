For information on creating scheduled reports, see\n\nScheduling Reports.\n\nAccessing the Toolkit\n-----------------------\n\n1. In the navigation header, go to\n **More**\n >\n **Admin.**\n\n\n 2. In the\n **Governance**\n menu, select\n **Toolkit.**\n\n*Note:**\n If the\n **Toolkit**\n option does not display in the Governance menu, ensure your user role has the required grants. You may need to enable the Toolkit by reaching out to your Account Executive (AE).\n\nRequired Grants\n-----------------\n\n\n To access the Governance Toolkit, you will need one of two grants enabled: Create Custom Pipeline Processes or Administer Custom Pipeline Processes. Grants can be added to a custom user role. By default, the Administer Custom Pipeline Process grant is enabled for Admin users.\n\n\n####\n\nCreate Custom Pipeline Processes\n\n\n* Allows the user to create, update, share, and delete jobs.\n* Only allows the user to view jobs that they created or jobs that have been shared with them.\n\n\n####\n\nAdminister Custom Pipeline Processes\n\n\n* Allows the user to create, update, share, and delete jobs.\n* Allows the user to see all jobs within the pipeline.\n\n\n To learn more about custom roles and grants, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles.\n\nAdding a Triggered Report to a New Job\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1.

After choosing DataSets or Alerts, select\n **Next.**\n\n*Note:**\n Scheduled reports can be triggered by DataSet updates or Alerts, but not both.
