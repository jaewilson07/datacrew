Intro
-------

AdvancedMD makes software for independent medical practices that lets users integrate physician and patient workflows.  The AdvancedMD Connector allows you to retrieve data about patient demographics and Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes so that your medical practice can measure patient progress over time to see what's working well and help your patients improve as fast as possible. To learn more about the AdvancedMD API, visit their page (

 You connect to your AdvancedMD account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the AdvancedMD connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in
