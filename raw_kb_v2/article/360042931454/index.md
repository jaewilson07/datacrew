Intro
-------

Domo Dimensions is a repository of mapping files, including ZIP codes, US state names, country names, area codes, a calendar, and more. Domo Dimensions allows you to pull a single file from a list of provided files that we find to be useful when aggregating common forms of data. e.g. zip codes, calendar, countries, etc. Use the Domo Dimensions connector to power cards, or use it to map existing datasets to power cards.


 This topic discusses the configuration options specific to the Domo Dimensions connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in
