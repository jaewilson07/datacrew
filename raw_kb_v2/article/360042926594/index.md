This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Constant Contact Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Constant Contact connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Constant Contact accounts in Domo) to open the Constant Contact OAuth screen where you can enter your Constant Contact username and password. Once you have entered valid Constant Contact credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Constant Contact DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

####
 Can I use the same account to create multiple DataSets?

Yes.

####
 How often can the data be updated?

As often as needed.

####
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

If the API reaches the daily call limit, the API key will not be able to make calls until 12:00 am the next day.
