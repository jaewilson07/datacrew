You must have an \"Admin\"\n\ncustom role\n\nwith the \"Edit users\" privilege enabled to do this.\n\n\n For information about managing user accounts for connectors, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n**To change information in a user account,**\n\n.

If you have enabled SSO and you want to update any email addresses, you will need to do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n **More**\n**> Admin > Authentication > SAML (SSO)**\n .\n2. Temporarily disable SSO.\n3. Navigate to the\n **Governance >**\n**People**\n tab and locate the user whose email address you need to update.\n4. Edit the email address to match the address you have in your SSO environment.\n5. Reenable SSO in the\n **Authentication >**\n**SAML (**\n**SSO)**\n sub-tab.\n\nBecause deactivating SSO can affect users' ability to access the instance, we would suggest doing this outside of normal operating hours.\n\n\n For more information about SSO in Domo, see\n\nUnderstanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043438933\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004064\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nChanging User Information\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,040\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:19 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "changing_user_information", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "administrating_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamlGAC"}, {"text": "controlling_access_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanMGAS"}, {"text": "user_and_group_management", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapJGAS"}]}
