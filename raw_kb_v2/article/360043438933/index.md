You can change information for a user by changing account information in
 **More >**
**Admin > Governance > People**
 , including the user name, email address, phone number, title, security role, group membership, and content access. You must have an "Admin"

custom role

with the "Edit users" privilege enabled to do this.

 Email addresses are
 *not*
 editable while SSO is enabled. If you have enabled SSO and you want to update any email addresses, you will need to do the following:

. Navigate to
 **More**
**> Admin > Authentication > SAML (SSO)**
 .
2. Temporarily disable SSO.
3. Navigate to the
 **Governance >**
**People**
 tab and locate the user whose email address you need to update.
4. Edit the email address to match the address you have in your SSO environment.
5. Reenable SSO in the
 **Authentication >**
**SAML (**
**SSO)**
 sub-tab.

Because deactivating SSO can affect users' ability to access the instance, we would suggest doing this outside of normal operating hours.
