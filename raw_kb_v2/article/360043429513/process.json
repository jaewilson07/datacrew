Unlike other pie-type charts in Domo, Stream Funnel charts allow you to include series data (though this is not required). Legends are not shown in a Stream Funnel chart unless series data is included. Stream Funnel charts also do not show value data except upon mouse-over. Therefore they are most effective for showing relative differences between stages rather than representing exact amounts.\n\n\n This chart type is exactly the same as a\n\nStream chart\n\n(classified in the Chart Picker as an Area chart rather than a pie-type chart) but is shown vertically rather than horizontally.\n\n\n The following example shows a Stream Funnel without series data:\n\nWhereas the next example shows the same chart with series data applied:\n\nAlso unlike other types of Funnel charts, drill path is available in Stream Funnel charts. For more information about drilling, see\n\nAdding Drill Path to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n Powering Stream Funnel Charts\n-------------------------------\n\nStream Funnel charts require two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a category column or row containing the names of each stage, and a value column or row containing the corresponding values for each stage. You can also add a column containing series data if you want. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Stream Funnel chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from the category, value, and series columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Stream Funnel chart:\n\nCustomizing Stream Funnel Charts\n----------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a Stream Funnel chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n .
