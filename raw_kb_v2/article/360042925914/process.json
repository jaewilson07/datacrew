For example, you might put in the \"To Do\" list tasks that you have just conceived or that are still in the planning stages. Then, when work begins on those tasks, you would move them into the \"Working On\" list to indicate that work is underway on those tasks. Finally, when work has been finished on the tasks, you would move them into the \"Completed\" list.\n\n*Note:**\n Tasks in the \"To Do\" and \"Working On\" lists (and any new lists you create based on the \"To-Do\" and \"In Progress\" types) count towards the \"Open Tasks\" number for a project. Tasks in the \"Completed\" list (and any new lists you create based on the \"Completed\" type) count towards the \"Closed Tasks\" number for a project. For more information about creating new lists, see\n\nAdding a Task List to a Project\n\n.\n\n*To move a task from one task list to another,**\n\n. Click and drag the task to the desired list.\n\nYou can also change the position of tasks within a list. You do this the same way\u2014by clicking a task and dragging it to the position you want within the list.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042925914\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004364\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMoving Tasks Through a Project Workflow\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,763\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:45 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "moving_tasks_through_a_project_workflow", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "getting_to_know_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamsGAC"}, {"text": "projects_and_tasks", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zao5GAC"}]}
