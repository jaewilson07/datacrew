For example, you might put in the \"To Do\" list tasks that you have just conceived or that are still in the planning stages. Then, when work begins on those tasks, you would move them into the \"Working On\" list to indicate that work is underway on those tasks. Finally, when work has been finished on the tasks, you would move them into the \"Completed\" list.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Note:\n                         \n                         Tasks in the \"To Do\" and \"Working On\" lists (and any new lists you create based on the \"To-Do\" and \"In Progress\" types) count towards the \"Open Tasks\" number for a project. Tasks in the \"Completed\" list (and any new lists you create based on the \"Completed\" type) count towards the \"Closed Tasks\" number for a project.
