Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack. With this connector visualize your ElasticSearch data in Domo for additional insights. Use Domo's Elasticsearch connector to return search hits that match the query defined in the request. Get real-time dashboards of your data, available from any device. To learn more about the Elasticsearch API, visit their page (

 You connect to your Elasticsearch account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Elasticsearch connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Elasticsearch account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Elasticsearch host name
* The username and password associated with your Elasticsearch account

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
