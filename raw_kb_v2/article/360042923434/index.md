 FAQ
-----


#####
 What credentials do I need to power up this connector?

You need the username or email ID associated with your Concur account.

####
 How do I know that my Concur credentials are secure?

The login process uses the OAuth process, so your Concur credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.

####
 How frequently can the data be updated?

As often as needed.

####
 How does my user role affect the data returned in the Concur connector?

You can receive the company-wide expense reports only if your user has the 'Web Services Admin role'. Otherwise, you can only see items for your user.

####
 Can I use the same account for generating different reports?

Yes.
