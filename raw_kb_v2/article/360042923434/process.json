To learn more about Concur's API, visit their page\n\nhttps://developer.concur.com/api-reference/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Concur account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Concur connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Concur account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Client ID\n* Client Secret\n* The username and password used to log into your Concur account\n\nTo obtain your Client ID and Secret, contact your Concur Partner Enablement Manager or Partner Account Manager. Once you have registered an application, you will receive a Client ID and Client Secret. For more information on getting started with Concur's API, see\n\nhttps://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html\n\nConnecting to Your Concur Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Concur Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Concur instance.

You can manage connector accounts in the Accounts tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Concur report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|\n Report\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Company Card Transactions\n  |\n Receives a list of unassigned company card charges for the user.\n  |\n|\n Entry Attendee Associations\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Entry Attendee Associations.\n  |\n|\n Expense Allocations\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Allocations.\n  |\n|\n Expense Attendees\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Attendees.\n  |\n|\n Expense Attendee Types\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Attendee Types.\n  |\n|\n Expense Delegators\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Delegators.\n  |\n|\n Expense Entries\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Entries.\n  |\n|\n Expense Form\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Form.\n  |\n|\n Expense Group Configurations\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Group Configuration.\n  |\n|\n Expense Itemizations\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Itemizations.\n  |\n|\n Expense Reports\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Expense Reports.\n  |\n|\n Expense Reports Detail\n  |\n Receives detailed data about Concur Expense Reports.\n  |\n|\n Extract Definitions\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Extract Definitions.\n  |\n|\n Extract Jobs\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Extract Jobs.\n  |\n|\n List Items\n  |\n Receives data about Concur List Items.\n  |\n|\n Locations\n  |\n Receives details of locations that are used by Concur and that are valid at the company of user.\n  |\n|\n Receipt Images\n  |\n Receives data about Concur Receipt Image.\n  |\n|\n Reports Detail\n  |\n (deprecated.

This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n####\n How frequently can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n How does my user role affect the data returned in the Concur connector?\n\nYou can receive the company-wide expense reports only if your user has the 'Web Services Admin role'. Otherwise, you can only see items for your user.\n\n####\n Can I use\u00a0the same account for generating different reports?\n\nYes.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042923434\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003822\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nConcur Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,742\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "concur_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
