Google Fit  uses sensors in your mobile devices or activity tracker to record physical fitness activities, which are measured against the your fitness goals to provide a comprehensive view of your fitness.  To learn more about the Google Fit API, visit their page (

https://developers.google.com/fit/

).


 You connect to your Google account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Fit connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Google account and create a Google Fit DataSet, you must have Google credentials.


 Connecting to Your Google Account
-----------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Google Fit Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Google Fit connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Google accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can enter your Google credentials. Once you have entered valid Google credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google Fit  DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Google.


###
 Details Pane

This pane contains a primary
 **Reports**
 menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.

 FAQs
------


#####
 How do I know my Google credentials are secure?

Domo's GoogleFit connector uses OAuth, which authenticates the account with Google without Domo ever having access to your Google account credentials.

####
 Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?

No. A standard Google account with Google Fit data is all that is required to power up this connector.

####
 How often can the data be updated?

DataSets should be set to update once a day.
