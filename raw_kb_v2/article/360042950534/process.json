Do NOT share any of the content in this page with customers!\n\nThere are two approaches to getting data from Oracle Hyperion/Essbase\u00a0and into Domo. The first is to have the customer run jobs to extract the data from the dabase, put it into a CSV file, and use Workbench to upload it to Domo. If that's what you're going to do, then you can stop reading now.\n\n\n If, however, you want Workbench to connect directly to the Hyperion/Essbase\u00a0database, then you have two options for connecting. You can either run Workbench directly on the Hyperion/Essbase\u00a0server (assuming it's installed on a Windows server), or run Workbench on a different workstation/server. In the case of the former, the ODBC driver you need is already installed, and it's called\n **DataDirect <version number> Oracle Wire Protocol**\n . Configuring the ODBC driver is beyond the scope of this document. Sorry. You'll have to figure that out on your own.\n\n. The first thing you'll need to do is go to this page:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-enterprise-edition/downloads/bi-downloads-2537285.ht...\n2. Next, accept the license agreement and download\n **File 2**\n for Microsoft Windows x86-64-bit.\n3. Unzip the file you downloaded,\n\nobi\\_WINDOWSX64\\_11.1.1.9.0\\_2of5.zip\n\n, to the location of your choice.\u00a0For purposes of this demonstration, we'll assume you unzipped it to\n\nc:\\OBIEE.\n4. Open a command prompt and navigate to the\n\nDataFiles\n\ndirectory of the files you unzipped. E.g:\n\n\n`cd /d c:\\OBIEE\\bishiphome\\Disk2\\stage\\Components\\oracle.bi.bifndnepm\\11.1.1.9.0\\1\\`\n\n\n`DataFiles`\n\n\n5. Unzip the\n\n\\common\\ODBC\n\ndirectory from\n\nfilegroup1.jar\n\nto a location of your choosing. For purposes of this demonstration, we'll assume\n\nc:\\DataDirect\n\n\n`unzip -j filegroup1.jar common\\ODBC\\* -d\u00a0c:\\DataDirect`\n\n. Make a backup of your Windows Registry by opening the Windows Registry Editor, right-clicking on\n **Computer**\n , and selecting\n **Export**\n .\n7. You will need to rename\n\nDataDirect.reg.txt\n\nto\n\nDataDirect.reg\n\n.\n8. (Optional)\u00a0If you unzipped\n\nfilegroup1.jar\n\nto a location other than\n\nc:\\DataDirect\n\n, you will need to edit\n\nDataDirect.reg\n\nso that it reflects this new path.\u00a0Right-click on the file\n\nDataDirect.reg\n\nand select\n **Edit**\n ,\u00a0change the paths, and save the file. Don't screw up. Keep in mind that backspaces must be escaped with a backspace (\\\\). Single (\\) and triple backspaces (\\\\\\) are not your friends here. Don't let them stay in your file.\n9. Double-click the file\n\nDataDirect.reg\n\n. When asked if you want to continue, click\n **Yes**\n .\n\n\n Y\n\nou should now be able to add a 64-bit ODBC Data Source. If you get an error, it's because you modified DataDirect.reg and there is now a typo or incorrect path in the registry.\n\n0. Open Windows Registry Editor and fix the errors in\n\nHKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\ODBC\\ODBCINST.INI\n\n. A correct entry will look similar to\u00a0this:\n\n\n That's it. It's now on you to configure the 64-bit ODBC datasource. May the Force be with you.\n\njames.blevins@domo.com\n\n\n datadirect.reg.txt\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042950534\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003156\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nInstalling Drivers for Hyperion/Essbase\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,384\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:10 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "installing_drivers_for_hyperionessbase", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "other_connection_methods", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanzGAC"}]}
