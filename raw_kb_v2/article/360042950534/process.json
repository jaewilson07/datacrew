The first is to have the customer run jobs to extract the data from the dabase, put it into a CSV file, and use Workbench to upload it to Domo. If that's what you're going to do, then you can stop reading now.\n                       \n\n                        If, however, you want Workbench to connect directly to the Hyperion/Essbase\u00a0database, then you have two options for connecting. You can either run Workbench directly on the Hyperion/Essbase\u00a0server (assuming it's installed on a Windows server), or run Workbench on a different workstation/server. In the case of the former, the ODBC driver you need is already installed, and it's called\n                        \n                         DataDirect <version number> Oracle Wire Protocol\n                        \n                        . Configuring the ODBC driver is beyond the scope of this document. Sorry. You'll have to figure that out on your own.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The first thing you'll need to do is go to this page:\n                          \n                           http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-enterprise-edition/downloads/bi-downloads-2537285.ht...\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                          Next, accept the license agreement and download\n                          \n                           File 2\n                          \n                          for Microsoft Windows x86-64-bit.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Unzip the file you downloaded,\n                          \n                           obi_WINDOWSX64_11.1.1.9.0_2of5.zip\n                          \n                          , to the location of your choice.\u00a0For purposes of this demonstration, we'll assume you unzipped it to\n                          \n                           c:\\OBIEE.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                          Open a command prompt and navigate to the\n                          \n                           DataFiles\n                          \n                          directory of the files you unzipped.
