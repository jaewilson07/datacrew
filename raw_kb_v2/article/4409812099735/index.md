Figma is a web-based, collaborative graphics editor and prototyping tool used in interface designing. With Figma, everyone works towards a shared goal. The Figma apps for Android and iOS allow viewing Figma prototypes in real-time on mobile devices. Use Domo's Figma Connector to obtain the details about the files in a specific project, components, component sets and styles within a file library as well as a team library, and the projects within a specified team.


 With the Figma Connector, enable your product teams to ship new products faster and feel more confident in their decisions. By combining your Figma data with Domo's leading business intelligence platform, you'll develop comprehensive strategies to fully optimize your business. Within minutes you'll be able to create customized reports for your most important KPIs, helping you get a holistic view of your file library and team library performance. To learn more about the Figma API, visit their page (

 The Figma Connector is a "Cloud App" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Figma account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Figma Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in
