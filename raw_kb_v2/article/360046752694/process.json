The Sumo card builder interface consists of a\n                        \n\n                          Column View\n                         \n\n                        and a\n                        \n\n                          Pivot View\n                         \n\n                        .\n                        \n\n                          Column View\n                         \n\n                        provides an interface for creating standard column-based tables, whereas in\n                        \n\n                          Pivot View\n                         \n\n                        you can create pivot tables. You can manipulate table data in each view independently. The view that is selected when you save your table is the view that appears in this Sumo card in the page view.\n                       \n\n\n                         In the build/edit interface for a Sumo card, you can add and remove columns, sort, aggregate, change how date data is represented, and so on. The available options are the same whether you are building a Sumo card, editing an existing card, or applying temporary edits in the\n                         \n                          Details\n                         \n                         view.

You can add columns to your pivot table by dragging and dropping them into the desired region of the template table. Normally you drop category columns into the rows and columns regions of the template table and value columns into the values region. However, you are not required to do so. For example, you might want to show sales by zip code. The \"Zip Codes\" column would be interpreted by Domo as a values column and thus appear in your \"Values\" unused column listing. But you could drop it into the rows or columns region of your template table, and it would be treated as category data.\n                            \n\n                             For more information about building pivot tables, see\n                             \n                              Adding a Sumo Card\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n                             When you click a column name in the template table, a dialog pops up in which you can specify filters for this column.
