This gives you greater control over the layout of your data and allows you to provide more effective and visually pleasing data stories for your viewers. Collections are given default names and descriptions, but you can change these to better suit your business needs. You can reorder Cards within a Collection, reorder Collections themselves within a Page,\u00a0or remove\u00a0Cards from the Collection. You can also minimize Collections so that only the names show, or delete them. When you remove Cards from a Collection or delete the Collection, the Cards are returned to the Page in their default \"unorganized\" state.\n                       \n\n                        Collections are available\n                        \n                         only\n                        \n                        in standard Pages. In Domo Stories Pages, groups of Cards are called \"Domo Stories\" and have different functionality from Collections. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating Domo Stories\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        The layout of Cards in a Collection is preserved per user. For example, if a user collapses the \"Sales\" collection, leaves the Page, then comes back, the \"Sales\" collection is still collapsed. Another user coming to the Page for the first time, however, sees all collections expanded. If he or she then make\u00a0changes, those changes are preserved\u00a0just for that user.\n                       \n\n                        You can resize Cards that are in a Collection just as you can any other Card. For more information about resizing Cards, see\n                        \n                         Changing the Size of Cards in a Page\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           If you have a \"Participant\" security role, you can only view, minimize, and reorder Cards within Collections. You cannot add or remove Collections,\u00a0remove Cards from a Collection, move Cards to a different Collection, or change the name or description of a Collection. For more information about security roles, see\n                           \n                            Default Security Role Reference\n                           \n                           .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        The following example shows a Page in which Cards with sales data have been organized into two Collections\u2014\"Sales by Region\" and \"Sales by Category.\" A user viewing this Page can more easily find the data he needs by going to the desired Collection.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Video - Personalizing Pages\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating and Managing Collections\n                       \n\n\n                         To create a Card Collection,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Navigate to the Page in which you want to create the Card Collection.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                          in the upper right corner of the screen.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select\n                          \n                           New Collection\n                          \n                          .
