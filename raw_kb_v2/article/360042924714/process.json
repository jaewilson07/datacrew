By using different images to indicate different ranges, you can convey to users whether the current value is positive, neutral, or negative. The classic example of this kind of gauge in Domo is the face gauge, which shows a smiling red face for positive range values, a neutral orange face for middling values, and an angry red face for negative values.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In addition to faces, all of the following shapes are available for you to use in shape gauges:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Different shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, pentagons, and octagons\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Thumbs up/thumbs down\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Airplanes taking off/landing\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Lightning bolts\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Batteries that are empty, half-full, and full\n                         \n\n\n\n                          And dozens more\n                         \n\n\n\n                        In addition, you can vary shapes by customizing their\u00a0colors, giving you even more options to choose from.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        You can have up to 10 ranges in a shape gauge.\n                       \n\n                        Other gauge types in Domo include\n                        \n                         Single Value gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Filled gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Progress Bar gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Radial gauges\n                        \n                        , and\n                        \n                         Comparative Fill gauges\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Powering shape gauges\n                       \n\n                        A shape gauge requires only one column or row of data from your DataSet, which\u00a0should contain\u00a0value data.
