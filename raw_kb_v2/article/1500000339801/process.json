It helps you customize and personalize your marketing business with API integration and value-added marketing applications. The REST API provides a powerful, convenient, and simple REST-based web services interface for interacting with Salesforce. Experience the ease of integration and development with Domo's Salesforce Marketing Cloud Rest connector. Use this\u00a0connector to get the data about your campaigns and campaign assets with its powerful, convenient, and simple REST-based interface. To learn more about the Salesforce Marketing Cloud API, visit their\n\nAPI documentation\n\n.\n\n\n The Salesforce Marketing Cloud\u00a0Rest\u00a0connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Rest connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\nTo connect to your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Salesforce Marketing Cloud subdomain. It is a 28-character string starting with the letters \"mc\".\n* The client ID and client secret from your OAuth 2.0 API integration.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Salesforce Marketing Account\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n\n\n**Credentials**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Details**\n\n\n panes in the\n\nSalesforce Marketing Cloud\u00a0Rest\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n\n\n**Scheduling**\n and\n\n\n**Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n\n\n Credentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nSalesforce Marketing\n\naccount.
