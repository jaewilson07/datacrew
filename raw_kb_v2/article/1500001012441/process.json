Use Domo's Hubspot Writeback connector to export your data from a Domo DataSet to your Hubspot account. To learn about the HubSpot API, visit their website (\n\nhttp://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your HubSpot account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Hubspot Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need your\u00a0Domo Client ID and Client Secret.\n\n\n To create a Domo client ID and client secret:\n\n. Log into the\n\nDomo developer account\n\n.\n2. In the top right corner under\n **My Account**\n click\n **New Client**\n .\n3. Enter the application name and description.\n4. Provide the application scope by selecting the checkboxes for\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n6.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500001012441\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003996\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nHubspot Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,974\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "hubspot_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
