By transferring\u00a0long, slow-moving email threads to Buzz, you can\u00a0take advantage of the clear context visibility and speed to collaborate that Buzz provides.\n                       \n\n                        You import an email thread into Buzz by\u00a0following these basic steps:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Generate a unique email address within Buzz just by clicking a button.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Copy the email address into your email conversation as a recipient.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Send the email.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        This pulls the conversation into Buzz as a new conversation, along with its context, collaborators, and attachments. All collaborators are notified by email that the conversation has been imported into Buzz; the email also provides a link allowing them to jump directly into the new conversation. Collaborators may also continue to participate in the conversation via email, and their messages will still appear in Buzz.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Sending Emails to Buzz\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Things to Note\n                       \n\n                        Here are some things to keep in mind when using this tool:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The email address you generate in Buzz is unique to you.\u00a0You can use it anytime you want to send an email from your Inbox into Buzz.
