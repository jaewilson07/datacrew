Use Domo's GitHub connector to retrieve data about GitHub followers, repositories, organizations, users, gists, and much, much more. To learn more about the GitHub API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your GitHub account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the GitHub connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your GitHub account and create a DataSet, you must have your GitHub credentials (i.e. your username/email address and password).\n\n\n Connecting to Your GitHub Account\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the GitHub Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0GitHub\u00a0connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing GitHub\u00a0accounts in Domo) to open the GitHub OAuth screen where you can enter your GitHub\u00a0credentials. Once you have entered valid third-party tool\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new GitHub DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into GitHub when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of GitHub.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails P\n\n\n ane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the GitHub report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Public Events\n  |\n Returns all public events\n  |\n|\n All Public Gists\n  |\n Returns the list of all Public Gists\n  |\n|\n All Public Repositories\n  |\n Returns all public repositories\n  |\n|\n All User Issues\n  |\n Returns all user issues\n  |\n|\n All Users\n  |\n Returns the list of all users\n  |\n|\n Assignees -

This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account anytime.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nYou can make up to 5000 requests per hour.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042928694\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003582\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGitHub Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,747\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "github_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
