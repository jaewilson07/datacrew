 Troubleshooting
-----------------

If you cannot see the field for
 **DataSet Cloud**
 during job configuration, make sure you have downloaded Workbench 5.2 from the Appstore.


 Confirm that you are connected to an instance of Domo that has Cloud Amplifier enabled and that the authenticated Workbench user has the Override Default Cloud grant in the same instance.


 If you still cannot see the field, contact
