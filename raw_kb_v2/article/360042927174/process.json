Use Domo's Sailthru connector to compile reports on emails, blasts, users, and the like. To learn more about the Sailthru API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         https://getstarted.sailthru.com/new-.../api-overview/\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        There are two versions of the Sailthru connector\u2014a simplified and an advanced version. The major difference is that the advanced version allows you to configure a range of specific or relative dates for the data in your report, whereas the simplified version only lets you enter a number of past days. Also, the advanced version offers an additional report type\u2014\"Emails.\" This topic discusses the advanced version of the report. To learn about the simplified version, see\n                        \n                         Sailthru Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your Sailthru account in the Data Center.
