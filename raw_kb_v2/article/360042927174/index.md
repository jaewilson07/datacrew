Intro
-------

Sailthru is a cross-platform marketing company whose platform tracks user preferences and behavior on clients' websites, email, and mobile apps. Use Domo's Sailthru connector to compile reports on emails, blasts, users, and the like. To learn more about the Sailthru API, visit their page (

https://getstarted.sailthru.com/new-.../api-overview/

).


 There are two versions of the Sailthru connector—a simplified and an advanced version. The major difference is that the advanced version allows you to configure a range of specific or relative dates for the data in your report, whereas the simplified version only lets you enter a number of past days. Also, the advanced version offers an additional report type—"Emails." This topic discusses the advanced version of the report. To learn about the simplified version, see

Sailthru Connector

.


 You connect to your Sailthru account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sailthru Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Sailthru account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 A Sailthru API key
* A Sailthru API secret

You can obtain both of these by logging into your Sailthru account and navigating to the
 **Account Settings**
 page.


 Check

https://my.sailthru.com/settings/api\_postbacks

to see if IP whitelisting is enabled for API access on your Sailthru account. If so, your credentials will not validate in the connector until you add Domo's IPs to the whitelist. A current list of Domo's IPs can be found here:
