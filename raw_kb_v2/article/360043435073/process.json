This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Trello connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Best Practices\n----------------\n\nThis connector should run on \"Replace\" at any reasonable schedule.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Trello account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address or username you use to sign in to Trello\n* Your Trello password\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Trello Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Trello Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Trello connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n\n*Add Accoun**\n t\n\nif\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Trello accounts in Domo) to open the\u00a0Trello OAuth screen where you can enter your\u00a0Trello username/email address\u00a0and password. Once you have entered valid\u00a0Trello credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Trello DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0two primary\u00a0menus,\n **Report**\n and\n **Filter**\n , along with other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report and filter\u00a0you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Trello report.
