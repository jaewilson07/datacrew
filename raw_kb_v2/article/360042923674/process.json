The following article will give you the knowledge you need about joining data using SQL so you can avoid Invalid Query errors and duplicate row problems like this in the future.\n\n\n Append and Join Data Video\n----------------------------\n\nWatch the following video to gain a better understanding of joining and appending data:\n\n\n Use Case Example\n------------------\n\nJoins in SQL are used to combine two tables together, typically when you are adding additional columns. Joins work by combining two tables together on a unique column. The type of join you\u2019re using will determine the way the two tables will join together.\n\n\n For example, say you have a table (see Table 1) that gives you daily sales numbers and a second table (see Table 2) that gives you daily number of employees worked, and you would really like to see how many employees worked on any given day and compare that to your sales numbers for each day. Using a full outer left join, we would join the two tables together, so that date = date. Any row on table two that has a date that matches table one will be joined onto table one on the same row. So, for Table 3, we now have date, the daily sales, and the number of employees worked all in the same table.\n\n\n When you pull this DataSet into Domo, no error will result.\n\n####\n Table 1.

Let\u2019s look at Table 4 and 5, which are similar to Tables 1 and 2 above, but now two rows in both tables happen to have the same date of 2016-05-17. Again, if we perform a left outer join where date = date, each row from Table 5 will join on to every matching row from Table 4. However, in this case, the join will result in 4 rows of duplicate dates in the joined DataSet (see Table 6).\n\n####\n Table 4.

To help you get a better sense of which rows in a dataset are affected by each type of join, review the following visuals:\n\n\n LEFT OUTER JOIN\n\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN\n\nINNER JOIN\n\nFULL OUTER JOIN\n\nIn summary, ensure you\u2019re applying the proper type of join to match the same column types or column set-up that you would like to appear in your resulting dataset.\n\n\n Different Types of Joins Video\n----------------------------------\n\nWatch the following video to gain a better understanding of the different types of joins:\n\n\n Join Errors to Avoid\n------------------------\n\n\n* Joining where a string is equal to a value.\n* Joining on columns that have empty string values.\n* Performing a date function on a column in the join that looks like a date but for whatever reason is coming in as a string.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042923674\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004618\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nUnderstanding Joins\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 11,668\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "understanding_joins", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "understanding_data", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan0GAC"}, {"text": "data_literacy", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanSGAS"}]}
