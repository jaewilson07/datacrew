The following article will give you the knowledge you need about joining data using SQL so you can avoid Invalid Query errors and duplicate row problems like this in the future.\n                       \n\n                        Append and Join Data Video\n                       \n\n                        Watch the following video to gain a better understanding of joining and appending data:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Use Case Example\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Joins in SQL are used to combine two tables together, typically when you are adding additional columns. Joins work by combining two tables together on a unique column. The type of join you\u2019re using will determine the way the two tables will join together.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          For example, say you have a table (see Table 1) that gives you daily sales numbers and a second table (see Table 2) that gives you daily number of employees worked, and you would really like to see how many employees worked on any given day and compare that to your sales numbers for each day. Using a full outer left join, we would join the two tables together, so that date = date. Any row on table two that has a date that matches table one will be joined onto table one on the same row. So, for Table 3, we now have date, the daily sales, and the number of employees worked all in the same table.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          When you pull this DataSet into Domo, no error will result.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Table 1.

Let\u2019s look at Table 4 and 5, which are similar to Tables 1 and 2 above, but now two rows in both tables happen to have the same date of 2016-05-17. Again, if we perform a left outer join where date = date, each row from Table 5 will join on to every matching row from Table 4. However, in this case, the join will result in 4 rows of duplicate dates in the joined DataSet (see Table 6).\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Table 4.
