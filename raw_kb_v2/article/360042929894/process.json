To learn more about the\u00a0Picasa API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/picasa-web/\n\n).\n\n\n The Picasa connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Picasa account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Picasa connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nBecause Picasa is a Google application, you connect to Picasa by connecting to your Google account using your Google credentials (email address and password).\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Picasa Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n\nCredentials\n\nand\n\nDetails\n\npanes in the\u00a0Picasa Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Picasa connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Picasa accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can select the account you want to connect to.\u00a0After selecting an account, you are asked for the password for that account.\u00a0Once you have entered a valid password, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Picasa DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of\u00a0the currently active Google account.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains two menus, one from which you select a report type and one in which you enter the Picasa username.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0Picasa report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Albums\n  |\n Returns a list of albums for the specified user.\n  |\n|\n Photo Comments\n  |\n Returns a list of photo comments for the specified user.\n  |\n|\n Photos by Album\n  |\n Returns a list of photos for the specified user, broken down by album.\n  |\n|\n Tags\n  |\n Returns\u00a0a list of tags for the specified user.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the Picasa username of the user you want to retrieve information for. Enter\n\ndefault\n\nto refer to the authenticated user. If the username you enter is not the authenticated user, only public data is returned.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042929894\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003464\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPicasa Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,631\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "picasa_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
