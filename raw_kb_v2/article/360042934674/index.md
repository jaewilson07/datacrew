Intro
-------

The Profile page is like a user's personal home page in Domo. You can view information in any user's Profile view (and may also be able to edit it, depending on your

security role

).


 In a user's Profile view, you can do all of the following:

 See the user's personal information such as workplace role, department, contact information, and location.
* Follow the user.
* See where the user falls in your organizational hierarchy.
* See the user's stats in the company and in Domo, such as number of followers, number of likes in Buzz, etc.
* See the user's status (what they're working on).
* See the user's Domo Score.
* See the user's conversations, comments, photos, tasks, and status updates that have been "liked."
* See Buzz conversations the user has participated in.
* See what cards the user has viewed most recently or most frequently.
* See which DataSets a user owns.
* See what alerts the user is following.
* See what cards the user has added as Favorites.
* See the user's tasks and projects.
* View and manage personal photos.
* Award badges to a user.
* See what groups the user belongs to.
* Connect to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

The Profile view is divided into a number of panes from top to bottom. The page provides hyperlinks that allow you to quickly access all of the panes in the page. This topic discusses each pane from top to bottom in turn.

 Profile header
----------------

This is the "main" portion of the Profile view, the area first seen by viewers. Here you can view a user's personal information and see their user stats. You can also edit your own profile picture, enter status updates, and view/edit who you report(s) to.

*Note:**
 If a locked icon displays next to the item, this means that you are unable to edit it.

This is because the field is used as a Trusted Attribute. For more information on Trusted Attributes, see

Depending on your permissions, you may also be able to edit this information in other users' Profile pages. For more information about permissions, see

Managing Roles
