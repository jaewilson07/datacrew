Here you can view a user's personal information and see their user stats. You can also edit your own profile picture, enter status updates, and view/edit who you report(s) to.\n\n*Note:**\n If a locked icon displays next to the item, this means that you are unable to edit it.\n\nThis is because the field is used as a Trusted Attribute.
