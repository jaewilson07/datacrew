To learn more about the\u00a0BigQuery\u00a0API, go to\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/\n\n.\n\n\n You export data to BigQuery\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BigQuery\u00a0Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need the following:\n\n A Domo Client ID and Client Secret.\n* A Google Service Token JSON\u00a0file.\n\nThe following subsections explain in detail how to obtain the above credentials.\n\n##\n Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret\n\nTo create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\nand log in.\n2. Click\n **New Client**\n (found under \"My Account\" in the top right corner).\n3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n\nWhen you click\n **Create**\n , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.\n4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.\n\n\n###\n Obtaining a Service Token JSON File\n\nTo obtain a Google Service Token JSON file, do the following:\n\n. In the Google Developers Console, open the\n **Credentials**\n tab.\n2. Click\n **Create credentials**\n then select\n **Service account key**\n .\n3. Select\n **New service account**\n .\n4. Name the new service account.\n5. In the\n **Role**\n dropdown, select\n **Project > Owner**\n .\n6. For the\n **Key type**\n , select\n **JSON**\n .\n7. Click\n **Create**\n , then\n **Save**\n .\n8. Select a safe location for the file, as you will need it soon.\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google BigQuery\u00a0Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account as well as your destination table in BigQuery. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Paste the Domo client ID you copied in Step 4: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret, in the \"Prerequisites\" section above.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Paste the Domo client secret\u00a0you copied in Step 4: Creating a Domo Client ID and Client Secret, in the \"Prerequisites\" section above.\n  |\n|\n Service Token JSON\n  |\n Paste the JSON\u00a0Service Token you generated in Step 3: Creating a Service Account, in the \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Google BigQuery connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Input BigQuery Table Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the BigQuery table you want to send Domo data to. The table you indicate will be deleted and recreated with each run.\n  |\n|\n Input BigQuery DataSet Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the BigQuery dataset in which the table is found.\n  |\n|\n Input\u00a0Domo DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to a BigQuery table. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436933\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004041\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle BigQuery Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,887\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:19 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_bigquery_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
