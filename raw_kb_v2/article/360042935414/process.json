Pages are designed to give you the freedom to structure and arrange your data stories. Within each page is the ability to create subpages of related content or reports.\n\n\n Determine which pages and subpages you\u2019ll be creating first by asking who this dashboard is for and which business questions you\u2019re going to solve for within those pages and subpage. Simple navigation is the goal; use a nomenclature/hierarchy of Pages and Subpages that's familiar to the different functions within your company.\n\n##\n Collections & Cards\n\nCollections are best used to organize your cards around your business questions. Collections give you the ability to group your Primary Outcome card with the driver cards that answer your questions. Also, you can expand and/or collapse a collection of cards for a more fluid and clean navigation within a page.\n\n###\n Layout Tips for Collections and Cards\n\n\n* Limiting your number of Collections to roughly 3-5 Collections per page is ideal for navigation and information consumption.\n* Collection Titles are ideally your most pressing Business Questions that correspond to the function or page in Dashboard.\n* Use the Description in your Collection to define the problems you want to solve and the goals you\u2019re trying to achieve.\n* Use larger cards sizes for your Primary Outcome Cards or Hero Cards.\n* Select 3 to 6 Driver Cards per Collection that are sized smaller than the Hero Card. This will draw more attention and focus to your Primary Outcome(s) while still making it easy to see cards related to the Primary Outcome.\n\n\n###\n Page Locking\n\nEvery Domo user has the ability to take the cards and collections created on a page and arrange them to a custom view that makes most sense to them. However, as a Page Owner there are times when you want to lock the page layout so it can\u2019t be rearranged and the view is standardized for all users. In this case Page Owners can lock a page to maintain layout consistency for everyone access the page.\n\n\n###\n Page Filtering\n\nPage Filtering is best used to simplify and focus dashboards on data that matters most for the end user. For example, instead of a Manager having to build out a separate card for each Region or Country in your Business. You can quickly get to data and answer your questions by using Page Filters and filtering by country. Filters are not permanent and allow you to slice your data on the fly. You can quickly get to the information as well as save time by not having to build out a separate card for each dimension of the data you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\n###\n Related Cards\n\nWhile you can see the cards that are most directly related to a card in your collection the related card feature allows you to link to other cards found on other pages or subpages. This is especially useful if your related cards from other pages can provide more context and meaning to the card you\u2019re viewing.\n\n\n###\n Tracking to Goals/Pacing/Forecasting\n\nEvery Primary Outcome should have a goal you are tracking against and pacing to hit. We recommend cards that give context around the data being visualized. Visualizing your pace as it relates to the goal gives you quick insight on whether you\u2019re on or off target. If you\u2019re not on track and pacing with your goals, create cards that give you context to what you need to be doing in order to improve (what actions to take) to get back on track/pace.\n\n\n###\n Comparing Historical Data/Trends\n\nComparing current data to historical data is another effective way to track progress. Historical data provides the context that many executives and managers need to determine how their strategies and activities are making an impact on the growth of the company. This example card allows you to predict where you are and where you will be in comparison to previous months.\n\n##\n Content: Thinking across Multiple Datasets\n\nTake a step back and think through the optimal metric required to drive the Primary Outcome you are looking for. What is the real outcome you are trying to impact? Most likely, it will take more than one DataSet to answer it. Don\u2019t limit your dashboard simply by not thinking across DataSets.\n\n\n For example, you could track your campaign effectiveness three ways:\n\n Good: \u201cLeads by Campaign\u201d\n* Better: \u201cRevenue by Campaign\u201d\n* Best: \u201cROI or Profitability by Campaign.\u201d\n\nThe best tracking method typically requires multiple DataSets. Also, remember that your current access to data should not limit the creativity of which metrics you should be using or plan to use to run your business successfully. Identify the optimal metrics, even if you can\u2019t build them now, to keep as a roadmap for where you want to go in the future.\n\n\n###\n Forecasting, Predictive, & Multi-Linear Regression\n\nDashboards can be especially insightful when you apply Predictive and Multi-Linear Regression Modeling.\n\n\n Additional Elements in Domo to Optimize\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n###\n Alerts\n\nAlerts are especially useful for the decision makers who aren\u2019t interested in logging into the Domo platform every day in order to know what actions they should be taking with their business. Alerts allow business user to set up rules and conditions around their dashboards so as those are met they can get pinged directly when their attention is needed. Alerts tell you where to look for determining actions to take, and lead you to using Buzz as a collaboration tool to enact those decisions.\n\n##\n Buzz\n\nBuzz is great tool to implement Best Practices within your instance. As you initially design your dashboards and cards you\u2019ll need quick collaboration and feedback on what you\u2019ve built. The goal is to build the most useful and relevant dashboards that answer your users\u2019 business questions.\n\n\n Buzz allows you to quickly iterate and collaborate on those core principles, accelerating the adoption of your Dashboards and Cards. Buzz can take the place of your weekly meetings, as you talk about the data and what decisions you\u2019re going to make, the notifications of a card alert can be acted upon by having a meeting right then over Buzz to determine what you need to do.\n\n##\n Projects and Tasks\n\nOut of the business meetings you have in Buzz, with actions you need to happen based on your data, the projects and tasks can be assigned from Buzz conversations directly. By leveraging the value of Domo to establish a routine process of setting alerts, having Buzz collaboration conversations about a notification, and assigning projects and tasks based on the conversations, it allows you to move forward quickly on all of your data.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042935414\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004476\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDashboard Optimization Best Practices\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 3,301\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "dashboard_optimization_best_practices", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "training", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamyGAC"}, {"text": "selfservice_training", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoCGAS"}, {"text": "best_practices_resources", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoXGAS"}]}
