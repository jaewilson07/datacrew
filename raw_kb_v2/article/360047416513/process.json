Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5.

You do this in the\n **Add Do\n\n\n mo\u00a0Account**\n wizard.\n\n\n**To add an account in Workbench 4,**\n\n. Click\n **Add New**\n in the\n **Accounts**\n grouping\u00a0in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window.\n\n\n This opens the\n **Add Domo Account**\n wizard.\n2.
