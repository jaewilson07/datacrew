Decipher is a mobile-friendly, online survey software and reporting solution for insights pros who need to execute sophisticated quantitative research. To learn more about the Decipher API, visit their page (

https://support.focusvision.com/Deci...r\_REST\_API\_2.0

).


 You connect to your Decipher account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Decipher connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in adding
