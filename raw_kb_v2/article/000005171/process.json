You can change a field's designation by selecting either of these icons.\n                          \n\n\n                          An input field requires the integrating system to pass a mapping or value to the form. This is so that the field pre-populates with the mapping or value data when it renders to an end user.\n                         \n\n                          An output field passes the data in the field to the integrating system for use. When you create a form, you must determine what data the form requires as input and what data the form provides as output.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           View version list\n                          \n                          \u2014\u00a0Selecting\n                          \n\n                           View version list\n                          \n                          \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200blets you access the version history of a form.\n                         \n\n                          You can save a form as many times as you want before publishing it. The first version of a form has a Draft\u00a0status until you publish it, at which point the form has a Published\u00a0status.\n                         \n\n                          You cannot change a form's contract after the form has been published. This prevents breaking integrations with other products that use the form. However, after you publish a form, you can change\n                          \n                           its\n                          \n                          labels, descriptions, and the order of fields and sections.\n                         \n\n                          When you save a form after publishing it, a new version is created with a Draft\u00a0status. If you make changes to this version, the changes do not take effect at runtime until you publish it. You can create as many versions as you want, but note that you cannot change the contract from the original published form.\n                         \n\n                          You can view a previous version of the form, or make a previous version the current version of the form, using the\n                          \n                          action menu\n                          \n\n                          in each\u00a0version row.\u00a0,\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Save menu\n                          \n                          \u2014\u00a0The save menu has three options:\n                          \n                           Save Draft\n                          \n                          ,\n                          \n                           Safe Draft As\n                          \n                          , and\n                          \n                           Save & Publish\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                          You can\u00a0save your form as many times as you want before you publish it.

Each section represents a different page of the form when the form renders at runtime, so if you want one page, you only need one section.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For each item in a section, there are\n                        \n                         Label\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Field Type\n                        \n                        , and\n                        \n                         Data Type\n                        \n                        fields.\n                       \n\n                        Field Label and Description\n                       \n\n                        Enter text in the\n                        \n                         Label\n                        \n                        field to identify the name of the\n                        \n\n                        field that displays in the published form.
