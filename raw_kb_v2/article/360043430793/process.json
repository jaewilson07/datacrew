General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your AddThis account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your AddThis username and password.\n* Your AddThis Profile ID.\n\nTo find your Profile ID, do the following:\n\n.
