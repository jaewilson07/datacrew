To learn more about the Celtra API, refer to their blog (\n                        \n                         http://www.celtra.com/insights/blog/...ed-adcreator-3\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your Celtra account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Celtra connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n                        \n                         Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Best Practices\n                       \n\n                        The dimensions and metrics available when using the Celtra connector are almost identical to those in the Celtra Report Builder (which you can find in Celtra by going to\n                        \n                         Reporting Center > Report Builder\n                        \n                        ). It is recommended you use the Report Builder to build the report you want in Domo, noting the dimensions and metrics, then select those same fields in the Domo connector. This lets you quickly find the right data, speed up your connector configuration time, and schedule your reporting.\n                       \n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        To connect to your Celtra account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          A Celtra App ID\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A Celtra secret key\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Your Celtra subdomain\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can obtain your App ID and secret key by navigating to\n                        \n                         User Name > Settings\n                        \n                        in Celtra. After you create the API application, you will receive these credentials.\n                       \n\n                        You can find your Celtra subdomain by looking at the portion of your Celtra instance URL right after\n                        \n                         https://\n                        \n                        .
