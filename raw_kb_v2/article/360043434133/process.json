To learn more about the SocialFlow API, visit their Github page (\n\nhttps://github.com/SocialFlowDev/soc...ow-api-example\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your SocialFlow account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SocialFlow connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your SocialFlow account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address associated with your SocialFlow account\n* Your SocialFlow password\n\nAlternatively, you can sign in with Google credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to Your SocialFlow Account\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SocialFlow Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo SocialFlow connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing SocialFlow accounts in Domo) to open the SocialFlow OAuth screen where you can enter your SocialFlow\u00a0or Google credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new SocialFlow DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into SocialFlow\u00a0when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of SocialFlow.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the SocialFlow report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Accounts\n  |\n Returns a list of social accounts the SocialFlow client has authorized.\n  |\n|\n Content Archive\n  |\n Returns data for messages currently contained in the SocialFlow Content Archive.\n  |\n|\n Content Queue\n  |\n Returns data for messages currently in the SocialFlow Queue.\n  |\n|\n Content Sources\n  |\n Returns all content sources a user has added to SocialFlow.\n  |\n|\n Notifications\n  |\n Returns a list of notifications of recent activity detected by SocialFlow.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Service User ID\n  |\n Select the user or account you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434133\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003500\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSocialFlow Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,344\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "socialflow_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
