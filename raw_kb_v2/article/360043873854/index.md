Intro
-------

Greenhouse Software provides a recruiting software as a service that lets companies create a uniform interview procedure so candidates can be judged based on the same rubric. Use Domo's Greenhouse Demographic connector to retrieve lists of demographic questions and answers for recruiters. To learn more about the Greenhouse API, visit their page (

).


 You connect to your Greenhouse account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Greenhouse Demographic connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

 Prerequisites

To connect to your Greenhouse account and create a DataSet, you must have a Greenhouse API token. This token is provided by Greenhouse. If you do not have an API token, contact your Greenhouse customer service rep.
