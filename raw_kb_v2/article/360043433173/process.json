This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Cisco Prime connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Cisco Prime account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password for your Cisco Prime account\n* The hostname or IP address of the Cisco Prime instance\n\nConnecting to Your Cisco Prime Account\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Cisco Prime Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Cisco Prime account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the hostname or IP address for the Cisco Prime instance.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username for your Cisco Prime account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password\u00a0for your Cisco Prime account.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Cisco Prime credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Cisco Prime DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Cisco Prime report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Access Points\n  |\n Returns data about\u00a0wireless access points,\u00a0both unified and autonomous.
