 You connect to your Cisco Prime account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Cisco Prime connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Cisco Prime account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The username and password for your Cisco Prime account
* The hostname or IP address of the Cisco Prime instance
