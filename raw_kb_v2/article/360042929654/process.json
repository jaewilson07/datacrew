SugarCRM produces the web application\u00a0that is available in both open-source and commercial open-source applications. Use Domo's\u00a0SugarCRM\u00a0OAuth Connector to pull data for all your modules from SugarCRM REST API.\u00a0To learn more about the SugarCRM API, visit their website. (\n\nhttp://support.sugarcrm.com/Document...ces/index.html\n\n).\n\n\n The SugarCRM connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n ****Cloud App****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your SugarCRM\u00a0OAuth account in the\u00a0Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SugarCRM OAuth\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n****Primary Use Cases****\n | * Lead management\n* Pipeline management\n* Sales management\n* Customer relationship management\n |\n|\n****Primary Metrics****\n | * Leads\n* MQL\n* SAO\n* Closed Deals\n* Won Deals\n* Average Deal Size\n* Open Opportunities\n |\n| ****Primary Company Roles**** |\n Marketing, sales\n  |\n| ****Average Implementation Time**** |\n 10-15 hours\n  |\n| ****Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**** |\n 5\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your SugarCRM\u00a0OAuth account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your SugarCRM username and password\n* The host URL for your company's SugarCRM instance\n* Your SugarCRM client ID (which you can find in the\n **SugarCRM Admin**\n page under\n ****OAuth Keys****\n ; \"sugar\" is the default client ID for API access)\n\nConnecting to Your SugarCRM\u00a0OAuth Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SugarCRM\u00a0OAuth Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your SugarCRM\u00a0OAuth account.
