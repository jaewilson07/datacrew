To learn more about the Twitch API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://dev.Twitch/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Twitch account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Twitch connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Twitch account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password for your Twitch account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Twitch Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Twitch Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Twitch connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Twitch accounts in Domo) to open the Twitch OAuth screen where you can enter your Twitch username and password. Once you have entered valid Twitch credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Twitch DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Twitch when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Twitch.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Twitch report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Active Teams\n  |\n Returns a list of active teams.\n  |\n|\n All Streams\n  |\n Returns a list of all live streams.\n  |\n|\n Blocks\n  |\n Returns a block list for a specified user.\n  |\n|\n Channel Follows\n  |\n Returns a list of users who follow a specified channel.\n  |\n|\n Channel Streams\n  |\n Returns streams for a specified channel.\n  |\n|\n Channel Subscribers\n  |\n Returns a list of subscribers for a specified channel.\n  |\n|\n Channels Followed by User\n  |\n Returns a list of channels followed by a specified user.\n  |\n|\n Chat Emoticons\n  |\n Returns a list of chat emoticons.\n  |\n|\n Check Subscription for User\n  |\n Returns subscription details for a specified user and channel.\n  |\n|\n Current Streams Summary\n  |\n Returns a summary of live streams.\n  |\n|\n Editors\n  |\n Returns a list of editors for a specified channel.\n  |\n|\n Featured Streams\n  |\n Returns a list of featured live streams.\n  |\n|\n Followed Streams\n  |\n Returns a list of live streams you are following.\n  |\n|\n Games\n  |\n Returns a list of the most popular games.\n  |\n|\n Get Specific Channel\n  |\n Returns details for a specified channel.\n  |\n|\n Ingest\n  |\n Returns a list of Twitch ingest servers.\n  |\n|\n Relationship Between User and Channel\n  |\n Returns relationship details for a specified user and channel.\n  |\n|\n Search Games\n  |\n Searches for games based on a specified search query.
