Notebook cards are Cards containing text you enter. You can type or paste text in a Notebook Card. You can format text using bold, italics, strikethrough, and numbered and bulleted lists by selecting options in the toolbar. You can also add images, hyperlinks, tables, and dynamic Summary Numbers to Notebook Cards.\n\n*Note:**\n When you paste text certain formatting may be preserved, including bold, italics, lists, tables, font size, and headings. The formatting that is preserved varies, depending on the source. Typically, formatting associated with basic HTML tags is preserved, although styles may differ. Pasted images are stripped\u00a0out. If you want to add images, use the Image Uploader.\n\n\n**Video - Notebook Cards**\n\nAdding Notebook Content\n-------------------------\n\n*To add a Notebook Card to Domo,**\n\n. Navigate to the page where you want the Notebook Card to appear.\n2. Click\n\n*> Create new Card**\n .\n\n\n A dialog appears with a number of card creation options to choose from.\n\n*Tip:**\n You can also open this dialog from anywhere in Domo by selecting\n\nin the app toolbar and selecting\n **Card**\n .\n3. Click\n **Notebook**\n .\n\n\n The Notebook create view appears.\n4. (Optional) To change the default title, click the title field and replace the text with your desired title text. You can also add a description and Smart Text.\n5. Enter your text in the blank field.\n6. Apply formatting and add tables, hyperlinks, images, and dynamic Summary Numbers\u00a0as desired.\n\n\n The following table describes the available toolbar options:\n\n\n|\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Font Size Picker\n  |\n Lets you change the font size of selected text. Four sizes are available\u2014\n **Header**\n (largest),\n **Title**\n ,\n **Subtitle**\n , and\n **Text**\n (smallest).\n  |\n|\n Styling Options\n\n|\n Lets you change the styling of selected text.\n\n* Click\n\n to apply bold style to the selected text.\n\t* Click\n\n to apply italic style to the selected text.\n\t* Click\n\n to apply strikethrough style to the selected text.\n\t* Click\n\n to open the color picker for the selected text. |\n|\n Bulleted\u00a0List\n\n|\n Adds a bulleted list to the card. When you add a bulleted list, a new bullet item is added each time you hit Enter. To turn off the list, hit Enter or click the icon a second time.\n  |\n|\n Numbered List\n\n|\n Adds a numbered list to the card. When you add a numbered list, a new list item is added each time you hit Enter. To turn off the list, hit Enter or click the icon a second time.\n  |\n|\n Horizontal Alignment\n\n|\n Lets you change the horizontal alignment on the page of the line of text that currently contains the cursor. Note that this option is used to change the alignment of just one line, while the\n **Vertical Alignment**\n option changes the alignment of all text on the page.\n  |\n|\n Vertical Alignment\n\n|\n Lets you change the vertical alignment of all the text on the page.\u00a0Note that this option is used to change the alignment of all text on the page, while the\n **Horizontal Alignment**\n option changes the alignment of just one line.\n  |\n|\n Table\n\n|\n Lets you add a table to the card. When you click this icon, a grid image appears; you can mouse over this image to select the desired number of rows and columns in the table then click the bottom-rightmost square to add the table. In the following example, the user wants a 3x3 table, so he mouses over the grid as shown here:\n\nThe user then clicks on the square in the bottom right to add the table.\n\n\n Tables in Notebook Cards size columns automatically depending on the amount of text entered. You can change column width manually by clicking and dragging on the column borders.\n\n\n When you click in a table cell, an options icon\n\nappears. Click on this to open an options menu for the table. These options are as follows:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Add column left\n  |\n Adds a column to the left of the selected row.\n  |\n|\n Add column right\n  |\n Adds a column to the right of the selected row.\n  |\n|\n Delete column\n  |\n Deletes the selected column.\n  |\n|\n Add row above\n  |\n Adds a row above the row with the cursor.\n  |\n|\n Add row below\n  |\n Adds a row below the row with the cursor.\n  |\n|\n Delete row\n  |\n Deletes the selected row.\n  |\n|\n Delete table\n  |\n Deletes the entire table.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Summary Number\n\n|\n Lets you add a dynamically changing Summary Number to this card,\n\nsimilar to those that appear in most cards with charts\n\n. You choose the DataSet with data you want to summarize, along with the column and the desired aggregation type. You can also configure display options. Once you have added a Summary Number to your Notebook Card, it will update automatically anytime the data updates. The process for adding Summary Numbers to Notebook Cards is discussed in more detail later in this article.\n  |\n|\n Image Uploader\n\n|\n Opens the Image Uploader tool, which lets you\u00a0select and upload an image from your computer. JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs are all supported.\n\n\n You can delete an image by either selecting it or moving the cursor to the right of it then pressing Backspace/Delete.\n  |\n|\n Hyperlink\n\n|\n Lets you add a hyperlink to the card. When you add a hyperlink, you can define the action that takes place when a user clicks on it. These actions include either opening a specified web page or opening other content in Domo, either in the same browser tab or in a different tab. This is discussed in more detail later in this article.\n  |\n|\n Smart Text\n\n|\n Lets you add dynamically changing text to this Card. You can choose to display DataSet info, Filters, Segments, or Date range data. Once you have added the Smart Text to your Notebook Card, it will update automatically anytime the data updates. The process for adding Smart Text to Notebook Cards is discussed in more detail later in this article.\n  |\n7. Click\n **Done**\n when you are finished.\n\n\n You can close without creating a Notebook Card by clicking the \"x\" in the top right corner.\n\nAfter you click\n **Done**\n , a Notebook Card containing your text is added to Domo.\n\n\n Defining Hyperlink Actions\n----------------------------\n\nWhen adding a hyperlink to a Notebook Card, you can define the action that occurs when a user clicks on it. These actions may be either of the following:\n\n Opening other content in Domo, either in the same browser tab or in a different tab\n* Opening a specified web page\n\n***To configure specified Domo content to open when the link is clicked,****\n\n.

Click\n ****Save****\n again.\n\nAdding Summary Numbers\n------------------------\n\nYou can add a Summary Number to your Notebook Card referencing a given DataSet column. Thereafter, anytime the underlying data changes, the Summary Number will change automatically. To add a Summary Number, you choose the DataSet\u00a0with data you want to summarize, along with the column and the desired aggregation type. If you want, you can filter your selected column as well as configure display options. Once you have added a Summary Number to your Notebook Card, it will update automatically anytime the underlying data updates.\n\n\n Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) are respected when adding Summary Numbers to Notebook Cards. For more information about PDP, see\n\nPersonalized Data Permissions (PDP)\n\n.\n\n\n**To add a Summary Number to a Notebook Card,**\n\n. Create a new Notebook Card or open an existing Notebook Card and go into the editor by clicking\n **Edit**\n in the upper right corner.\n2. Click\n\nin the editor toolbar.\n\n\n This opens the\n **Create Summary Number**\n dialog, in which you set all of the options for your Summary Number.\n3. In Section 1, do the following:\n\n1. In the\n\t **DataSet**\n\t field, select the DataSet\u00a0containing the column you want to derive your Summary Number from.\n\t2. (Optional) In the\n\t **Label**\n\t field, enter a description that will appear when a user hovers over the Summary Number.\n\t3. In the\n\t **Data to summarize**\n\t menu, select the DataSet column you want to derive your Summary Number from.\n\t4. In the\n\t **Displayed by**\n\t field, select how you want the data to be aggregated.\n\n\n\t For example, if your Summary Number is to reflect a monetary value, you would probably want to select\n\t **Sum**\n\t or\n\t **Average**\n\t .\n\t5. (Optional) If you want to filter the values in the column, click\n\t **Add Filter**\n\t , choose the column you want to filter on, then configure your filters.\n\n\n\t Filter options differ depending on the type of data you're filtering.\n\n\t* (Conditional) If the selected column contains series data,\n\n\n\t\t\t1. Select the checkboxes for each series you want to pass your filters.\n\n\n\t\t\t You can select all of the checkboxes by clicking\n\t\t\t ****All****\n\t\t\t or deselect all of the checkboxes by clicking\n\t\t\t ****None****\n\t\t\t .\n\n\n\t\t\t You can filter the series that appear in the list by entering a keyword or a string of characters found in a keyword in the\n\t\t\t ****Filter by****\n\t\t\t field.\n\t\t\t2.
