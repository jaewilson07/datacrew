This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Pivotal Tracker\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Pivotal Tracker\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have a Pivotal Tracker\u00a0username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Outbrain Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Pivotal Tracker\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Pivotal Tracker\u00a0account.
