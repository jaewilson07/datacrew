These new options\u00a0bring a whole new experience to Alerts and help you to\u00a0trust your alerts more than ever before. These new options include the following:\n\n You can schedule when you want an alert to evaluate so nothing is missed. If you don't want your alert evaluating over the weekends, or after business hours, you can adjust it.\n* You can choose whether to continue to receive notifications for triggered alerts based on the alert evaluation schedule you have set. For example, if you selected\n **Hourly**\n for your evaluation schedule, once the alert triggered a notification would be sent once every hour until the triggered state ended or you deactivated the alert.\n* New time-based (\"current value\") alerts help you to set measurable goals and then be alerted when the progress you expect is not taking place.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCreating an Alert for a Visualization Card\n\n.\n\n###\n Alert Sharing\n\nGet the right alerts into the hands of the right people using the new Alert Sharing feature.\u00a0You can now share alerts with other users in your Domo so they receive notifications every time that alert triggers. You can also share alerts in Buzz conversations, in which case all users following the conversation receive notifications.\u00a0Alert sharing allows you to create business alignment by providing shared understanding on critical data conditions.\n\n\n By popular demand, we also support the ability to share an alert with a group. It is now even easier to align your team on the most critical business conditions. No longer do you need to add\u00a0each of your team members individually.\n\n###\n Mobile Alerts\n\nWe now provide native alert support for the iOS and Android applications. Alerts enable you to set custom thresholds to be notified when your business KPIs hit a defined limit. This enables you to run your business even more seamlessly. In addition to the power of alerts, Domo users can now receive push notifications for any subscribed triggered alert and be taken right to the card within their native apps. In the card, you can find detailed information about the alert so you can dig in to fully understand the reason for the alert. Available in the iOS and Android app updates.\n\n\n###\n Chart Updates\n\nThe following additions and updates have been made to the visualization experience in Domo:\n\n A new chart type, 100% Stacked Bar with Line, is now available.\n\nFor more information, see\n\n100% Stacked Bar with Line Graph\n\n.\n* Two new country maps have been added:\n\n+ The Philippines. For more information, see\n\n Country Map\n\n .\n\t+ Post-2015 France. This map includes updated regional divisions as per the changes that went into effect on January 1, 2016. The legacy version of the map will continue to be available. For more information, see\n\n Country Map\n\n .\n* Another new map, U.S. State, lets you show county-level\u00a0data for specific states. All you need to power a U.S. State chart is a column with FIPS\u00a0(county) data and your value column.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nU.S. County Map\n\n.\n* You now have the ability to set line or range scale markers dynamically based on a percentile, percentage, or standard deviation. You can also include scale markers based on quantiles (shown in the following example).\n\nFor more information about these properties, see\n\nAdding Scale Markers\u00a0to Your Chart\n\n.\n* Various new properties have been implemented for customizing legends, hover legends, and data labels in pie-type graphs. For more information, see\n\nProperties for Pie-Type Charts\n\n.\n* You can now set custom sizing on table cards in the card view when the \"Full Size\" option is selected\u2014anywhere from 1 to 6 card sizes in both width and height.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nChanging the Size of Cards in a Page\n\n.\n* You can access table formatting and total/subtotal options from the column dropdowns\u00a0above your table preview, allowing you to make quick customizations to specific columns in your table.\n\n\n###\n Duplicate Page\n\nDomo\u00a0now provides a\n **Save As**\n option for pages, which allows you to copy all content, collections, layouts, card sizes, and filters. This results in a new page with all content and settings duplicated.\n\n\n Using this option, you can duplicate a page with all of the following elements copied:\n\n Cards\n* Card sizes\n* Filters built into cards using Analyzer\n* Collections\n* Page-level filters\n\nThis option does\n *not*\n copy the following elements from pages:\n\n Sub-pages\n* Temporary filters created at the card Details level\n* Alerts on cards\n* Scheduled reports\n* Users the original page was being shared with\n\nYou can access this option by selecting\n **Save As**\n in the wrench menu for the page. You then enter the desired name for the new page, indicate whether you want to open the new page after you save, then save the changes.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nDuplicating Pages\n\n.\n\n##\n Bulk Add Users\n\nYou\u00a0can now easily add teams, departments, and organizations to your Domo instance in a single action. The new \"Bulk Add\" feature enables you to provide a list of people you want to add to your\u00a0Domo instance. The file just needs to be in CSV\u00a0format and include, at a minimum, a list of email addresses and display names.\n\n\n All you need to do to import your list of users is go into\n **Admin > People > Bulk Add**\n and follow the instructions. You can even download a sample CSV file that shows you how your list should be formatted. The days of adding users to Domo one by one are over!\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAdding Users to Domo\n\n.\n\n##\n New Self-Service Connectors\n\nThis month we have polished and released another 49 connectors that are now available to all customers in their Domo account.
