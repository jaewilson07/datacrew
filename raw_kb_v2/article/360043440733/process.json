These new options\u00a0bring a whole new experience to Alerts and help you to\u00a0trust your alerts more than ever before. These new options include the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          You can schedule when you want an alert to evaluate so nothing is missed. If you don't want your alert evaluating over the weekends, or after business hours, you can adjust it.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          You can choose whether to continue to receive notifications for triggered alerts based on the alert evaluation schedule you have set. For example, if you selected\n                          \n                           Hourly\n                          \n                          for your evaluation schedule, once the alert triggered a notification would be sent once every hour until the triggered state ended or you deactivated the alert.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          New time-based (\"current value\") alerts help you to set measurable goals and then be alerted when the progress you expect is not taking place.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating an Alert for a Visualization Card\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Alert Sharing\n                       \n\n                        Get the right alerts into the hands of the right people using the new Alert Sharing feature.\u00a0You can now share alerts with other users in your Domo so they receive notifications every time that alert triggers. You can also share alerts in Buzz conversations, in which case all users following the conversation receive notifications.\u00a0Alert sharing allows you to create business alignment by providing shared understanding on critical data conditions.\n                       \n\n                        By popular demand, we also support the ability to share an alert with a group. It is now even easier to align your team on the most critical business conditions. No longer do you need to add\u00a0each of your team members individually.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Mobile Alerts\n                       \n\n                        We now provide native alert support for the iOS and Android applications. Alerts enable you to set custom thresholds to be notified when your business KPIs hit a defined limit. This enables you to run your business even more seamlessly. In addition to the power of alerts, Domo users can now receive push notifications for any subscribed triggered alert and be taken right to the card within their native apps. In the card, you can find detailed information about the alert so you can dig in to fully understand the reason for the alert.
