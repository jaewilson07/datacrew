All period-over-period charts include only two fields, one for an x-axis column (which will always include time period data) and one for a y-axis column (which will always include value data). For information about applying columns to a chart, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n The following table lists and describes all of the available period-over-period charts. You can click a thumbnail image to see a full-sized version of that image. For information about building all of the charts in this table, see\n\nPeriod-over-Period Charts\n\n.\n\n\n Period-over-Period Chart Type\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Screenshot\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Bar Line\n  |\n Period being compared is shown as bars; all other periods are shown as lines.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Variance Bar Line\n  |\n Periods are shown as bars and variance values are shown as lines.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Line Bar\n  |\n Period being compared is shown as a line; all other periods are shown as bars.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Variance Line Bar\n  |\n Periods are shown as lines and variance values are shown as bars.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Trendline\n  |\n All periods are shown as lines.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Variance Trendline\n  |\n All periods and variance values are shown as lines.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Grouped Bar\n  |\n All periods are shown as bars.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n\nRunning Total Line\n\n|\n\nAll periods are split into\n\n\n running total lines\n\n\n .\n\n|  |\n|\n Multi-Value Gauge\n  |\n Shows the value for the selected date range, with the percent change from the selected comparison timeframe (e.g. the quarter-to-date value with the percent change from one quarter ago for comparison).
