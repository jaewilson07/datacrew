There are currently seven period-over-period chart types in Domo, all of which have a corresponding standard chart type. All period-over-period charts include only two fields, one for an x-axis column (which will always include time period data) and one for a y-axis column (which will always include value data). For information about applying columns to a chart, see

 The following table lists and describes all of the available period-over-period charts. You can click a thumbnail image to see a full-sized version of that image. For information about building all of the charts in this table, see
