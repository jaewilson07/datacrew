Awardco is a cloud-based employee recognition solution designed to boost employee engagement and simplify the reward process with incentivized programs. With Awardco, managers can recognize and reward the deserving employee within a matter of seconds, making the recognition process more empowering, relaxing, and flavorful from service awards to sales incentives. Use Domo's Awardco connector to retrieve data about recognitions, redemptions, transactions, and users in your organization. To learn more about the Awardco API, visit their page (
