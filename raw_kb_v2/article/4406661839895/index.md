Intro
-------


 AirNow receives real-time air quality observations from over 2,000 monitoring stations and collects forecasts for more than 300 cities around North America. Use Domo's AirNow Connector to access these air quality observations and forecasts through Domo.


 You create an AirNow DataSet in the Data Center.

The

AirNow

Connector is a "Cloud App" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your

AirNow a

ccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the

AirNow

Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

* Historical observations
* Monitoring site by geographical bounding box
 |
| **Primary Company Roles**  | * Disaster management department
* Weather control department
* Any business unit within an organization looking to correlate weather data with business performance for meaningful business intelligence
* Any individual or business requiring weather data that is tied to a specific location, region, or geographic area
 |
| **Average Implementation Time**  |
 Less than 10 mins
  |
| **Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**  |

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your AirNow account and create a DataSet, you must have your AirNow API key.

You can request your API Key at

https://docs.airnowapi.org/account/request/


 Connecting to Your AirNow Account
-----------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the AirNow Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your AirNow account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:

Once you have entered valid AirNow credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new AirNow DataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

##
 Details Pane

This pane contains a primary
 **Reports**
 menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.
