This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the NASA connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to the NASA API\u00a0and create a DataSet, you must have a NASA API key. To request an API key, visit\n\nhttps://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to the NASA API\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the NASA Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to the NASA API. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter your NASA API key. To request an API key,\u00a0visit\n\nhttps://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid NASA credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new NASA DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the NASA report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Astronomy Picture of the Day\n  |\n Returns data about the Astronomy Picture of the Day.\n  |\n|\n Coronal Mass Ejection\n  |\n Returns coronal mass ejection (CME) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Geomagnetic Storm\n  |\n Returns geomagnetic storm (GST) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Interplanetary Shock\n  |\n Returns interplanetary shock (IPS) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Solar Flare\n  |\n Returns solar flare (FLR) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Solar Energetic Particle\n  |\n Returns solar energetic particle (SEP) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Magnetopause Crossing\n  |\n Returns magnetopause crossing (MPC) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Radiation Belt Enhancement\n  |\n Returns radiation belt enhancement (RBE) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n High Speed Stream\n  |\n Returns high speed stream (HSS) data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n WSA + ENLIL\u00a0Simulation\n  |\n Returns WSA + ENLIL simulation data for the given time period.\n  |\n|\n Notifications\n  |\n Returns all notifications for the given time period.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043435433\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003367\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNASA Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,644\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "nasa_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
