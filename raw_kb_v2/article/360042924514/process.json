The difference between the two is that with a standard Textbox, the text in the box comes directly from the DataSet, and only one macro is available; this macro lets you dynamically reference the first value in your selected value column.\n                       \n\n                        In a Dynamic Textbox, you enter the text yourself, but more than a dozen macros are available, allowing you to reference information from your selected category and value columns such as change percentage, column names, first/last/penultimate value, minimum/maximum/average value, first or last category, and so on.\n                       \n\n                        This allows you to build text cards with dynamic fields that update anytime your data updates. In the following example card, all of the called-out fields are set to update dynamically based on the content in the DataSet:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        The text can be as long as you want and can contain any character. You can format the text to be centered, left-aligned, or right-aligned, and can adjust margin size. You can also change the font size, color, and style. These and other options are discussed below.\n                       \n\n                        This article details how to use Dynamic Textboxes in the following topics:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Powering Dynamic Textboxes\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Customizing Dynamic Textboxes\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Powering Dynamic Textboxes\n                       \n\n                        Dynamic Textboxes\u00a0require\u00a0two columns or rows of data from your DataSet. One column references the\n                        \n                         category\n                        \n                        column you are deriving macros from, and the other column references the\n                        \n                         values\n                        \n                        column. For example, if you wanted your text to say something like \"Sales for [region] was [value],\" you would drag the column with your region names into the\n                        \n                         Category\n                        \n                        field and the column with your values into the\n                        \n                         Value\n                        \n                        field.\n                       \n\n                        At this point, the preview\u00a0simply pulls in the first category or value from your DataSet, which is probably not what you want.
