When you add a DataSet to Domo, you are assigned as the owner of that DataSet. For most DataSet types, you can change the owner of a DataSet in the details view of the DataSet. To change the owner of DataSets you do not currently own, you must have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with the "Manage DataSets" privilege enabled. For more information about default security roles, see

Managing Roles

.


 When you remove a user from Domo, you are prompted to reassign any DataSets owned by that user. For more information, see

Removing Users from Domo

 You can change DataSet owners singly or in bulk. To change owners in bulk,Â you must have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with the "Manage DataSets" privilege enabled.
