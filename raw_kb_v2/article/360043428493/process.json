A horizontal bar chart has the same overall concept, but the categories are represented along the vertical axis and the values are represented along the horizontal axis.\n                       \n\n                        Powering bar charts\n                       \n\n                        Both vertical and horizontal bar charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories and one for values. However, you can add series columns to a vertical or horizontal bar chart if you want. Adding series data to a bar chart turns it into a different chart type, usually either a\n                        \n                         grouped bar chart\n                        \n                        , depending on the data.\n                       \n\n                        For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your bar chart.
