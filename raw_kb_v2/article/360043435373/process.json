The Domo CNN connector takes those headlines and creates a new DataSet that can be used to provide current headlines into your Domo instance. For information about the CNN API, visit\n\n\n https://developer.cnn.com/docs/read/api\n\n.\n\n\n The CNN RSS connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou create a CNN DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0CNN connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to pull current news headlines into cards in Domo.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n N/A\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Executive\n* Director\n* Manager\n* Analyst\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 1-2 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 1\n\n\n |\n\n\n Best Practices\n-----------------\n\nThis connector provides predetermined feeds of news headlines by topic. As such it is simple to select the topics of interest. However, note that a new connection must be made for each report.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n No credentials are required.\n\n\n Creating a\u00a0CNN DataSet\n-------------------------\n\n\n This section describes how to create a CNN\u00a0DataSet in the CNN RSS\u00a0Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a single menu in which you select a CNN report type.\n\n\n The following table describes all of the predefined reports you can create using the Domo\u00a0CNN RSS connector.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nBusiness\n\n|\n\nReturns information on business news.\n\n|\n|\n\nCNN Student News\n\n|\n\nReturns information on student news.\n\n|\n|\n\nCrime\n\n|\n\nReturns information on crime news.\n\n|\n|\n\nEntertainment\n\n|\n\nReturns information on entertainment news.\n\n|\n|\n\nHealth\n\n|\n\nReturns information on health news.\n\n|\n|\n\nLiving\n\n|\n\nReturns information\u00a0on living news.\n\n|\n|\n\nMost Popular\n\n|\n\nReturns information on the most popular news.\n\n|\n|\n\nMost Recent\n\n|\n\nReturns information on the most recent news.\n\n|\n|\n\nPolitics\n\n|\n\nReturns information on politics news.\n\n|\n|\n\nTechnology\n\n|\n\nReturns information\u00a0on the latest technology news.\n\n|\n|\n\nTravel\n\n|\n\nReturns information on travel news.\n\n|\n|\n\nTop Stories\n\n|\n\nReturns information on the latest top stories.\n\n|\n|\n\nU.S.\n\n|\n\nReturns information on U.S. news\n\n|\n|\n\nVideo\n\n|\n\nReturns information on video news.\n\n|\n|\n\nWorld\n\n|\n\nReturns information on world news.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nEnsure that the connector is pulling the correct report and is on the needed schedule.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nThe CNN RSS feed will update when CNN publishes a new article to the selected feed.
