Use Domo's\n\nXTM Cloud C\n\nonnector to retrieve data about aspects of XTM projects, including statistics, cost estimates, actual costs, and more. To learn more about the\n\nXTM Cloud\n\nAPI, visit their page (\n\nhttps://xtm.cloud/api/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nXTM Cloud\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nXTM Cloud C\n\nonnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\n\nXTM Cloud\n\naccount and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The user ID and password for your XTM account.\n* Your client name associated with your XTM account.\n* Your XTM\u00a0domain. This is essentially the URL of your XTM instance minus the\n\nhttp://\n\n. For example, if your instance was\n\nhttp://domo.xtm-intl.com\n\n, you would enter\n\n\n domo.xtm-intl.com\n\n\n .\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nXTM Cloud\n\nAccount\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the XTM International Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nXTM Cloud\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the user ID (not your username) for your XTM account.\n\nYou can find the User ID in XTM on the User list.\n\n|\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password for your XTM account.\n  |\n|\n Client\n  |\n Enter the\n\nClient name for your XTM account.\n\n|\n|\n Domain\n  |\n\nEnter the Domain where you log in to your XTM account.\n\n\n Example: If you logged in at \"\n\nhttps://www.xtm-cloud.com,\"\n\n\" you would enter \"\n\nwww.xtm-cloud.com\n\n\" here.\n\n|\n\n\n Once you have entered valid XTM Cloud credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new XTM Cloud DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the XTM Cloud report you want to run. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Concordance\n  |\n Returns a concordance that matches the specified search parameters.\n  |\n|\n Customers\n  |\n Returns a list of customers.\n  |\n|\n Job Metrics\n  |\n Returns original and up-to-date metrics for the specified jobs.\n  |\n|\n Project Estimates\n  |\n Returns estimates for the specified project.\n  |\n|\n Project Metrics\n  |\n Returns original and up-to-date metrics for all jobs and general metrics for the whole project for each target language or one specified target language.\n  |\n|\n Project Statistics\n  |\n Returns up-to-date user statistics for all jobs for the whole project for each target language or one specified target language.\n  |\n|\n Project Status\n  |\n Returns the status of a specified project. There are three levels of response: project, jobs and workflow steps.\n  |\n|\n Projects\n  |\n Returns the list of Projects.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Returns all users associated with the account.\n  |\n|\n Workflows\n  |\n Returns all workflows related to the projects associated in the account.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Search Phrase\n  |\n Enter the search phrase.\n  |\n|\n Resource to search in\n  |\n Select the resource to search in.\n  |\n|\n Select the Source Language\n  |\n Select the source language for the project.\n  |\n|\n Select the Target Languages\n\n|\n Select the target language for the project.\n  |\n|\n Exact Match\n\n|\n Select the option to enable or disable exact match searching.\n  |\n|\n Select the Project\n\n|\n Select the project.\n  |\n|\n Project Select Type\n\n|\n Specify whether you want to retrieve the data for all projects or selected projects.\n  |\n|\n Select the Projects\n  |\n Select the projects.\n  |\n|\n Fetch level of statuses\n  |\n Select fetch level of statuses.\n  |\n|\n Skip Failed Projects\n  |\n When this option is checked, if XTMIntl fails to return details for a Projects, it will be excluded from the dataset and Domo will continue processing instead of failing the entire dataset run. This may result in missing data.\n  |\n|\n Select the Job ID\n\n|\n Select the Job Id.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042931554\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003321\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nXTM Cloud Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,375\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "xtm_cloud_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
