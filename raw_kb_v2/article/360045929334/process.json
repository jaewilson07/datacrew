Using\n\nDomo's\n\nZoom connector, you can\u00a0access\u00a0data associated with your Zoom usage including the number of meetings attended and time spent on zoom calls. As an Admin Zoom user, you can access activity data for all users within your Zoom account. To learn more about the Zoom API, visit their\n\nAPI Documentation\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Zoom account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Zoom connector user interface. General information for adding\n\nDataSets\n\n, setting update schedules, and editing\n\nDataSet\n\ninformation is discussed in\n\nAdding a\n\nDataSet\n\nUsing a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Zoom account and create a\n\nDataSet\n\n, you must have the following:\n\n Your Zoom email address\n* Your Zoom password\n\nor connect to Zoom via Google, Facebook, or an\n\nSSO\n\nlogin.\n\n*Important:**\n Each account can only be used once to authenticate to Zoom.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Zoom Account\n---------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Zoom Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your\n\nDataSet\n\n\n ,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a\n\nDataSet\n\nUsing a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Zoom connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Zoom accounts in Domo) to open the Zoom OAuth screen where you can enter your Zoom email and password. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Zoom\n\nDataSet\n\n. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Zoom when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Zoom.\n\n\n###\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n
