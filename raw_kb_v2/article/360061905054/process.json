Use the\u00a0Podium connector to understand your online reviews data with the Domo Podium integration. To learn more about the Podium API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://podium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API.html\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Podium account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Podium connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n To connect to your Podium account and create a DataSet, you must have the\u00a0API Token and Organization ID associated with your Podium account.\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nPodium\n\nAccount\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nPodium\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nPodium\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Token\n  |\n Enter the API Token. You may need to contact Podium to request this.\n  |\n|\n Organization ID\n  |\n Enter the organization ID. You may need to contact Podium to request this.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid Podium credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Podium\u00a0DataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\nPodium\n\nreport you want to run. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Invites\n  |\n Returns a location's invites\n  |\n|\n Location Summary\n  |\n Returns a summary of data about a location\n  |\n|\n Organization's Locations\n  |\n Returns a list of your organization's locations\n  |\n|\n Private Feedback\n  |\n Returns private feedback that has been provided for a location\n  |\n|\n Reviews\n  |\n Returns reviews about a specific location\n  |\n|\n Sites Summary\n  |\n Returns summary data about a location, broken down by website\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Location\n  |\n Select Location ID.\n  |\n|\n Report Duration\n  |\n Select the duration for the report (a Single Date, or a Date Range)\n  |\n|\n Single Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Specific Date\n  |\n Select the specific date using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Relative Date\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for in the\n ****Days Back****\n field. Specify either today or 0, yesterday or 1, or today-7 or 7 to get data for 7 days into the past.\n  |\n|\n Date Range\n  |\n Select the specific or relative date range.\n  |\n|\n Start Date - Specific\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n End Date - Specific\n  |\n Select the last date in your date range\u00a0using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Start Date - Relative\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data from (start day). Combine with\n ****************End Date****************\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\u00a010\u00a0for\n ****************Start Date****************\n and\u00a05\u00a0for\n ****************End Date****************\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n End Date - Relative\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data to (end day). Combine with\n ****************Start Date****************\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\u00a010\u00a0for\n ****************Start Date****************\n and\u00a05\u00a0for\n ****************End Date****************\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the Connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n###\n\nWhat version of the Podium API does this connector use?\n\nThis connector uses version 2 of the Podium API (\n\nhttps://podium.co/api/v2/\n\n).\n\n###\n\nWhich endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint URL(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Invites\n  |\n /locations/{locationId}/invites\n  |\n|\n Location Summary\n  |\n /locations/{locationId}/summary\n  |\n|\n Organization's Locations\n  |\n /organizations/{orgId}/locations\n  |\n|\n Private Feedback\n  |\n /locations/{locationId}/private-feedback\n  |\n|\n Reviews\n  |\n /locations/{locationId}/reviews\n  |\n|\n Sites Summary\n  |\n /locations/{locationId}/sites/summary\n  |\n|\n Users Summary\n  |\n /locations/{locationId}/users/summary\n  |\n\n\n####\n\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the API token and organization id associated with your Podium account.\n\n###\n\nHow often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n\nAre there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\nTroubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360061905054\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003238\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPodium Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,393\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "podium_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
