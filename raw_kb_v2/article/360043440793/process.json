Deep-dive on a single Card while maintaining the context of the other Cards on a Page, or apply Dashboard filters to change the view as you drill.\n\n\n To enable Drill Paths on Dashboards, select\n **Edit Content > Change interaction**\n for the Card, then choose the\n **Drill in place**\n radio button.\u00a0You must be in\n **Edit Dashboard**\n mode for these options to be available.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCreating Domo Stories\n\n.\n\n###\n Dashboard background colors\n\nCustomize your Dashboards with background colors to match any branding or theme. Choose colors from a palette or use hexadecimal values to personalize.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nCreating Domo Stories\n\n.\n\n###\n Summary metric view\n\nThe new summary metric view allows you to toggle charts on and off using the\n **Display settings**\n option in Domo Stories. This creates a formatted Summary Number so you can leverage existing content in the context that works best for your Domo Story.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nCreating Domo Stories\n\n.\n\n##\n Improved DataSet picker\n\nUse the new DataSet picker to search for DataSets with any filter criteria, like tags, certification state, row count, Card count, last execution time, execution status, and more. You can also sort your results for easier discovery.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nPowering a KPI Card with Data\n\n.\n\n##\n Enhanced Dashboard Filters\n\nEnhanced Dashboard Filters bring more clarity and context to Page filtering. Instead of choosing a DataSet to filter on, you can choose your filter columns from a list of all available columns used in Cards on the Page. Summary text on each Page appears whenever filters are applied, so you quickly see which filters are applied. Plus, Beast Mode calculations shared on a DataSet will now appear in the Dashboard Filter list.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n\n##\n Enhanced Analyzer Card Filters\n\nConfigure filters for Cards faster than ever before with enhanced Analyzer filters. With the new filtering improvements, you can:\n\n Filter on values containing specific words\u00a0without having to create Beast Mode LIKE functions.\n* Change the date type for a column without having to open a DataFlow.\n* Choose specific dates and numbers to filter on rather than indicating a range.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nAdding Filters to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n##\n New and updated Connectors\n\nConnect to all your data with our collection of over 1,000 connectors. We\u2019ve added several new connectors, including new bi-directional connectors, and we\u2019ve made updates to some existing ones.\n\n###\n New Connectors\n\n\n* Particle\n* Instagram Business\n* Salesforce with upsert\n* USGS Wildfire\n* Snapchat Ads\n* SEVENROOMS\n\nDocumentation coming soon!\n\n###\n Writeback\u00a0(Bi-directional) Connectors\n\nNew Writeback Connectors allow you to push Domo DataSets to third-party applications instead of pulling data from those applications into Domo.
