 New features and enhancements
--------------------------------

Features and enhancements in this release include the following:

##
 Domo Stories enhancements

Domo Stories Dashboards are now enhanced with Drill Paths, summary metrics, and background colors for even more control over the presentation of your data.

###
 Drill in Place

Drill Paths are now available from Pages, so you don't have to leave your Dashboard to drill into a Card. Deep-dive on a single Card while maintaining the context of the other Cards on a Page, or apply Dashboard filters to change the view as you drill.


 To enable Drill Paths on Dashboards, select
 **Edit Content > Change interaction**
 for the Card, then choose the
 **Drill in place**
 radio button. You must be in
 **Edit Dashboard**
 mode for these options to be available.

###
 Dashboard background colors

Customize your Dashboards with background colors to match any branding or theme. Choose colors from a palette or use hexadecimal values to personalize.

###
 Summary metric view

The new summary metric view allows you to toggle charts on and off using the
 **Display settings**
 option in Domo Stories. This creates a formatted Summary Number so you can leverage existing content in the context that works best for your Domo Story.

##
 Improved DataSet picker

Use the new DataSet picker to search for DataSets with any filter criteria, like tags, certification state, row count, Card count, last execution time, execution status, and more. You can also sort your results for easier discovery.

##
 Enhanced Dashboard Filters

Enhanced Dashboard Filters bring more clarity and context to Page filtering. Instead of choosing a DataSet to filter on, you can choose your filter columns from a list of all available columns used in Cards on the Page. Summary text on each Page appears whenever filters are applied, so you quickly see which filters are applied. Plus, Beast Mode calculations shared on a DataSet will now appear in the Dashboard Filter list.

##
 Enhanced Analyzer Card Filters

Configure filters for Cards faster than ever before with enhanced Analyzer filters. With the new filtering improvements, you can:

 Filter on values containing specific words without having to create Beast Mode LIKE functions.
* Change the date type for a column without having to open a DataFlow.
* Choose specific dates and numbers to filter on rather than indicating a range.
