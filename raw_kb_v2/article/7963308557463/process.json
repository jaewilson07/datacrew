It makes collaborative coding possible and enjoyable for large-scale enterprise software development teams.\n\n\n GitHub Enterprise includes the same great set of features as\n\nGitHub.com\n\nbut is packaged for running on your organization's local network. All repository data is stored on machines that you control, and access is integrated with your organization's authentication system (LDAP, CAS). Use GitHub Enterprise when you need complete control over repository and project information.\n\nYou connect to your\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\nConnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your GitHub Enterprise account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\n*username**\n .\n* A (\n\nproperly scoped\n\n)\n **Personal Access Token**\n* The\n **hostname**\n to your GitHub Enterprise instance\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\nAccount\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes on the GitHub Enterprise Connector page. The components of the other panes on this page,\n\n\n**Scheduling,**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\n\n Send PAT in authorization header as\n  |\n Select how you would like to send the PAT in the Authorization header of the API calls.\n\n\n Github recommends using the\n **Token**\n -based Authorization header.\n  |\n|\n Hostname\n  |\n Enter the hostname without \"\n\nhttp://\"\n\n\" or \"\n\nhttps://\"\n\n\".\n\n\n Example: If the URL is\n `https://xx.yy.zz.com`\n , just type\n `xx.yy.zz.com`\n |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Type in the username for the account you'd like Domo to use to connect to your GitHub Enterprise instance.\n  |\n|\n Personal Access Token (PAT)\n  |\n Type in the personal access token.\n\nWhen you\n\ncreate a personal access token\n\n, ensure you give it\n\nadequate scopes (permissions)\n\nfor each report you want to run.\n\n|\n\nOnce you have entered valid\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\nDataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n\n\n**Accounts**\n\n\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n\n\n If you are already logged into\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\nwhen you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n\n\n**Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of\n\nGitHub Enterprise.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n\n\n**Reports**\n\n\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\nreport you want to run. Make sure you grant your Personal Access Token (PAT) the necessary scopes for the reports you want to run.\n\n\n If you want to be able to run every report, you can use this link to\n **create**\n an access token with\n ***all***\n of the necessary\n **scopes**\n :\n\nhttps://\n **YOUR\\_GITHUB\\_INSTANCE.com**\n /settings/tokens/new?description=Domo%20GitHub%20Enterprise%20Connector&scopes=user,read:org,gist,repo,admin:org,admin:org_hook,admin:repo_hook,admin:public_key`\n\nThe following reports are available:\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Report Description\n  |\n Necessary PAT Scopes\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n All Notifications\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all notifications for the current user, grouped by the repository.\n\n|\n user\n  |\n|\n All Organizations\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all organizations.\n\n|\n read:org\n  |\n|\n All Organizations (Advanced)\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all organizations using site admin dashboard API.\n\n|\n read:org\n  |\n|\n All Private Feeds\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all private feeds.\n\n|\n no scope\n  |\n|\n All Public Events\n  |\n\nReturns a list of public events.\n\n|\n no scope\n  |\n|\n All Public Gists\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all public gists.\n\n|\n gist\n  |\n|\n All Public Repositories\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all public repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repo Comments\n  |\n\nReturns a list of comments for all repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repo Commits\n  |\n\nReturns a list of commits for all repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repo Issues\n  |\n\nReturns a list of issues for all repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repo Pull Request\n  |\n\nReturns a list of pull requests for all repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repo Pull Request Comments\n  |\n\nReturns a list of pull requests comments for all repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repo Pull Request Reviews\n  |\n\nReturns a list of pull requests reviews for all repositories.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Repositories (Advanced)\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all repositories data using site admin dashboard API.\n\n|\n repo\n  |\n|\n All Users\n  |\n\nReturns a list of all users in the order that they signed up on GitHub.\n\n|\n user\n  |\n|\n All Users (Advanced)\n  |\n Returns a list of all users with their state.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 7963308557463\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003178\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,475\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "github_enterprise", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
