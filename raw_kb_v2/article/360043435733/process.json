The Domo Fitbit Connector integrates Domo with\u00a0Fitbit to extract data from the\u00a0Fitbit API. The connector allows you to compile reports about a variety of health-related metrics.\u00a0To learn more about the\u00a0Fitbit API, visit their site (\n\nhttps://dev.fitbit.com/docs/\n\n).\n\n\n The Fitbit connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Fitbit account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Fitbit connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Health tracking, exercise tracking, weight loss, etc.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Activity metrics\n* Food consumption\n* Badges received\n* Amount of sleep\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * HR roles\n* Anyone who owns a Fitbit and wants to track their health metrics\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Fewer than 10 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Fitbit account and create a DataSet, you must have the email address and password you use to log into your Fitbit account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Fitbit Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Fitbit Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Fitbit connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Fitbit accounts in Domo)\n\n\n to open the\u00a0Fitbit OAuth screen you can enter the email address and password you use to log into your Fitbit account. Once you have entered valid\u00a0Fitbit credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Fitbit DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report\n\ns**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Fitbit report.

You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n How frequently does my data update?\n\nYour data can be retrieved every day. You may be able to retrieve some data for today's date, but the most accurate data will be from the day before or earlier.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nFitbit allows each user to make up to 150 API requests per hour. Note that a single DataSet run may require multiple API calls.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nEnsure that you have the correct Fitbit username and password.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043435733\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003345\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nFitbit Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,712\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "fitbit_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
