Use these features to access general or specific details about Workflows instances and, if needed, to recover instances that have\u00a0failed to execute.\n\n\n This article discusses Workflows tracking details in the following topics:\n\n Instances List\n* Filter panel\n* Metrics\n* Instances table\n* Instance details and playback (in progress)\n* Workflow instance recovery\n* Cancel workflow instances\n\nInstances List\n------------------\n\nYou can use the\n **Instances List**\n to view and filter Workflows\u00a0instances that have been deployed. This page shows how many instances have been deployed or executed for a specific period and provides other metrics to facilitate workflow management.\n\n\n###\n\n\n Filter Panel\n\nThere are several ways to narrow your search for an instance. The available filter options are listed below.\n\n **Workflow**\n \u2014\u00a0A list to filter the model. You must select one.\n* **Version**\n \u2014\u00a0A list to filter the instance by model versions. The available choices are All\u00a0Versions\u00a0or any deployed version by its version number.\n* **Status**\n \u2014 Checkbox options to filter instances by their current status.\u00a0The available statuses are Complete, In-Progress, Canceled, and Failed.\u00a0You can use all options in any combination.\n* **Time Period**\n \u2014\u00a0A list to filter instances by their Started By\n\n\n date. The available options are Today, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Year to Date, Lifetime, and Custom.\u00a0Note that choosing a longer time period may require more time to return results.\n\n##\n\n\n Metrics\n\nBelow are the six metrics currently available to help admins and editors understand how their instances perform.\n\n **Success**\n \u2014\u00a0The number of instances that completed successfully.\n* **In-Progress**\n \u2014\u00a0The number of instances that are currently\u00a0running.\n* **Canceled**\n \u2014\u00a0The number of instances that were canceled in the middle of the\u00a0flow.\n* **Failed**\n \u2014\u00a0The number of instances that have failed.\n* **Total**\n \u2014\u00a0The combined number of instances based on the selected\u00a0Filters.\n* **Avg Cycle Time**\n \u2014\u00a0The average runtime of all the instances based on the\u00a0selected\u00a0Filter should this be plural.\n\n\n A pie chart is also available to visually represent the metrics and their statuses as percentages.\n\n\n###\n\nBack to top\n\n\n###\n\n\n Instances Table\n\nThe\n **Instances**\n table displays information\u00a0about instances and helps you navigate\n\n\n to the instance\n\nDetails page, where you can view the inflight status of a workflow instance.\n\nYou can use the search bar to filter the list of instances by ID and other filtering options.\n\n###\n Filter Options\n\n\n* **Completed**\n \u2014\u00a0Similar to the Time Period Filter, this is a list to filter\u00a0instances by their completion date.\n* **Started by**\n \u2014 A list to filter\u00a0by the person who initiated the instance.\n\n###\n Instance List\n\nYou can select any\n\n\n instance in the list to navigate to the instance\n\n\n Details\n\npage, where you can view the instance diagram and flight status. Here are some pieces of information the table gives you:\n\n **ID**\n \u2014\u00a0The ID of the instance. This can be used in the\n **Instances**\n table search bar as a Filter.\n* **Version**\n \u2014\u00a0The model version the instance is related to.\n* **Status**\n \u2014\u00a0The most recent status of the instance.\n* **Started By**\n \u2014\u00a0The person who initiated the instance.\n* **Start**\n \u2014\u00a0The date and time the instance initiated.\n* **Complete**\n \u2014\u00a0If the instance status is Complete, a date and time displays. If the instance status is In-Progress, Failed, or Canceled,\u00a0the status displays as N/A.\n\n\n Back to top\n\nInstance Tracking Details and Playback (in progress)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe\u00a0Instance Tracking Details\n\npage displays a specific execution of an instance and the data used in that specific instance.\n\n\n You can navigate to this page by selecting an instance from the\n **Instances**\n list. Note that you can only access this page if you have the View Instance Details permission for the workflow.\u00a0Learn more about permissions in the\n\nWorkflows Overview\n\n.\n\nWhen you select an instance in the\n **Instances**\n list, the Details page for that instance displays.\n\nThe instance Details page displays the flow path the instance took during its execution and the data values that were passed and produced\u00a0by\n\n\n each step. You can see all of the completed steps, and which steps still remain if the instance is still in progress.\n\n##\n Instance Status\n\nThe instance status shows the overall status for the execution of\u00a0a\u00a0specific instance.\n\n\n See details about the three possible statuses below.\n\n **Complete**\n \u2014\u00a0The initiated instance has successfully reached one or multiple end shapes.\n* **In Progress**\n \u2014\u00a0The initiated instance is currently in progress and has\u00a0not reached its end shapes.\n* **Failed**\n \u2014\u00a0The initiated instance produced an error and failed before it could reach its end shapes.\n\n##\n Playback Controls\n\nUse the playback controls to start and replay the events of an initiated workflow instance. The controls display in the upper\n\n-\n\nright corner of the instance Details page.\n\nThe following table describes the playback controls:\n\n\n Icon\n  |\n Control\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |\n Toggle\n  |\n Controls whether the instance starts to auto-play or defaults to\n\nshow\n\nthe furthest point of execution.\n  |\n|  |\n Replay\n  |\n Replays the workflow from the first start shape.\n  |\n|  |\n Play\n  |\n Plays or resumes the workflow\u00a0from the last stopped point.\n  |\n|  |\n Stop\n  |\n Stops/pauses the workflow from\u00a0playing.\n  |\n|  |\n Fast Forward\n  |\n Increases the speed of playback. There are four speeds, and selecting the button repeatedly cycles through them.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Shape Status\n\nShapes that\u00a0were\n\n\n invoked\u00a0during\n\n\n the execution of the instance display with an icon and a corresponding colored border:\n\n **Completed shapes**\n \u2014 Display with a green check mark and a green border.\n* **In Progress shapes \u2014**\n Display with a blue spinner icon and a blue border.\n* **Failed shapes \u2014**\n Display with a red X\u00a0and a red border.\n\n\n####\n Shape Iterations\n\nFor shapes that have been activated multiple times in a workflow instance, the number of iterations display in the lower-right corner of the shape. If the shape has only been activated one time in the instance, no number displays.\n\n\n###\n Data Panel\n\nYou can select a shape on the Details page either during or after the playback to\n\n\n see the data used in the execution of an instance.\n\n\n To view the data panel for a shape in the workflow, select a shape.\n\n\n The data panel opens at the bottom of the screen and displays the data values used in the shape.\n\nAt the top of the data panel is the banner, which includes the title of the shape, the date and time it executed, the date and time it completed, the duration it was active, and the current status of the shape, which corresponds to the\u00a0shape's playback icon.\n\nThe data panel also displays the parameter names and types, along with how they were\u00a0mapped and the actual values used.\n\nUser Tasks and Service Tasks shapes display inputs and outputs, while other shapes display what the values of the variables were when the shape was activated.\n\n\n Data panels for shapes that have been activated multiple times and have more than one iteration include an option to scroll through the different iterations and see the data for each one. If multiple iterations for the shape exist, the option to scroll through them displays on the left side of the data panel, just below the banner.\n\nWorkflow Instance Recovery\n------------------------------\n\nThe instance Details page offers recovery capabilities if you have the Edit Instance Details permission for the workflow. Recovery means that if a workflow instance fails to complete due to a runtime error,\n\n\n or if\n\n\n the instance is still in progress, you can update the data and retry the execution from that point.\n\n\n If you have access to edit a workflow instance, you can\n\n\n select\n **Edit Instance**\n for shapes that have a status of Failed or In Progress. This option displays\u00a0in the upper\n\n-\n\nright corner\u00a0of the data panel for that shape.\n\n\n Select\n **Edit Instance**\n to enter Recovery mode.\n\nIn Recovery mode, a banner displays at the top of the screen. In the banner, you\n\nhave options to\n\n\n can\n\nselect\n **Exit Recovery**\n ,\n **Retry**\n , and\n **Cancel Instance**\n .\n\n\n###\n Recovery Options\n\nThe recovery options are described below.\n\n **Exit Recovery**\n \u2014\u00a0Returns you to\u00a0View-only mode on the instance Details page.\n* **Retry**\n \u2014\u00a0Attempts to execute\n\n\n again from where the workflow\u00a0failed or\n\n\n is currently in progress.\n* **Cancel Instance**\n \u2014\u00a0Stops all execution on a workflow instance and updates the status to Canceled.\n\n\n###\n Edit Workflow Instance Data\n\nWhile in Recovery mode, you can change input data\n\non\n\n\n at\n\nthe current or last active point in the workflow instance before attempting to retry the instance. To do this, locate the input you want to change in the data panel and select\n\n*Edit**\n for that input.\n\nSelecting\n\n*Edit**\n allows you to add or change the data value. When you are finished editing, select\n\n*Keep**\n or\n\n*Discard**\n .\n\nChange as many data inputs on the shape as you need to before selecting\n **Retry**\n as a recovery option in the banner.\n\n\n Note that you can only enter Recovery mode when as error has occurred or when the workflow instance is waiting for a shape in an In Progress\u00a0status to complete. The only shapes that have an In Progress status long enough for you to apply Recovery capabilities are a User Task or a Timer. The other shapes execute too quickly,\u00a0and trying to edit them while they are in an In Progress\u00a0status is not possible. However, you can attempt to recover any shape that has a Failed\n\n\n status.\n\n\n Cancel Workflow Instances\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you have a workflow instance in an In Progress\u00a0status that you know will never reach a Completed\u00a0status, it is best practice to cancel that instance so that it displays properly in the logs\u00a0and doesn't get\n\n\n updated by mistake.\n\n\n If a workflow instance that generates a task in a queue (from a User Task)\u00a0updates to Canceled, the task in the queue updates to a status of Void.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 000005179\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005179\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nWorkflows Tracking\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 550\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 4/6/2023, 7:48 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 4/6/2023, 8:05 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "workflows_tracking", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "administrating_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamlGAC"}, {"text": "workflows", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZkAMGA0"}]}
