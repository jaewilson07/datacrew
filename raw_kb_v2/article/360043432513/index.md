**Specific Dates**


 For specific dates you should use a

yyyymmdd

format. For example,

createdDate:[20160401 TO 20160402]

would query where the

createdDate

is between Apr 1, 2016 and Apr 2, 2016. For date and time use a format such as

2016042110000000

. That would be Apr 21, 2016 10:00AM. For open-ended ranges you can use the

\*

. For example,

updatedAt:[20160401 TO \*]

would account for anything greater than Apr 1, 2016.


**Relative dates**


 The connector supports relative dates. For example,

dateAdded:[today-7 TO today]

would query where the

dateAdded

field is between seven days ago and today.


 For a list of searchable fields, run the "Search Metadata" report.
