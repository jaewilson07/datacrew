It consists of different processes that run on specific hosts within your CDH cluster. The Domo Apache Impala SSH connector brings your data from the Apache server securely through an SSH tunnel into Domo.\n                        \n\n\n                        The\n                        \n                         ApacheImpala\n                        \n                        Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud.
