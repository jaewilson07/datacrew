All projects in Domo, including your "Personal Tasks" project, start out with these basic task lists—"To Do," "Working On," and "Completed." These lists are all part of a general chronological workflow. Generally speaking, tasks that work hasn't yet started on would be placed in the "To Do" list. You would then move them into the next column, "Working On," when work actually began on them. Finally, you would move them into "Completed" when the work was finished. For more information about moving tasks, see

 However, you may want additional lists in your workflow. The basic workflow stages that appear by default in Domo may not be specific enough for your project. For example, you may want to add stages such as "Ideas," "Customer requests," "Won't fix," etc. Domo lets you add as many new workflow lists as you want. All new lists must conform to one of three basic types—"To-Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
