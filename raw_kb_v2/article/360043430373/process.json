Usually this displays cards for all Alerts pertaining to the given category. The exception to this is when you perform a search, in which case the card carousel shows cards for all Alerts that include your search term. All Alert cards have options, such as subscribing to an Alert, adding a trending cards as a favorite, and so on.
