Intro
-------

In Domo, you can configure Alerts to set thresholds on metrics and receive notifications when there are important changes to your business. With Domo Alerts, you can take action when they arrive, and rest easy when they don't.


 In the Alert Center, you can do all of the following:

 View Alerts in a variety of categories—triggered, subscribed, owned by you, needs attention, and suggested.
* Share Alerts with other users in your Domo instance.
* Subscribe to suggested Alerts created by other users or unsubscribe from Alerts.
* See the trigger history for any Alert.
* Delete any Alert.
* Change the rule (i.e. the criteria that must be met for the Alert to trigger) and messaging for your Alerts.
* Change your Alert Notification settings.
* Open the
 **Discover**
 tool for Alerts.

You can access the Alert Center from any Page or Subpage by clicking
 ****Alerts****
 in the Page navigation bar at the top of the screen.

Parts of the Alert Center
---------------------------

The Alert Center is made up of 3 main screens, which you can switch between using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. These screens—and the icons you click on to access them—are as follows:

##
 Discover tool

The Alert Discover tool helps business leaders keep a pulse on all the important things happening in their business. Imagine a central command center with updates about opportunities being pushed from this month’s pipeline, unusual spikes in cost per conversion, trending hot topics in your organization, or important obstacles as simple as data connection failures. All of these updates and more live side-by-side in the Discover tool, where you can then take action as a team to capitalize on the most valuable opportunities.


 Discover brings all of the important information into a central location where you can discover and interact with new content. Domo intelligently organizes all the activity into a rich set of topics that users can explore. Subscribe to your boss’s Alert. Share a card with someone on your team. Start a new conversation with an old friend who logged into Domo for the first time.

You can refer to the following table to find out more about these components:

 Topics
  |
 Allow you to find out more about the Alerts in your Domo. Mousing over a category "freezes" the hopper/heat map, allowing you to more easily see the number of Alerts in that category as a percentage of all Alerts in the heat map. Clicking on a category opens the card carousel for that category (see below).


 Alerts are divided into a number of topic categories, as follows:
 * **Say hello to new people**
 . Shows the number of new people in your Domo instance.
* **Subscribe to these Alerts**
 . Shows the number of suggested Alerts in your Domo.
* **Everyone views these cards**
 . Shows the number of trending (most viewed) cards in your Domo.
* **Alerts you follow**
 . Shows the number of Alerts you are following.
* **Recently shared with you**
 . Shows the number of cards that have been shared with you recently.
* **Cards you should be following**
 . Shows the number of cards Domo recommends you follow.
* **Recently discussed cards**
 . Shows cards that have been discussed recently in Buzz conversations.
 |
|
 Search
  |
 Lets you search Discover for an Alert in any of the four topic categories.


 When you enter a search term without pressing Enter, any topics in which the search term is found filter down to show the number of Alerts that include that search term, while topics without the search term are grayed out.


 The heat map also freezes when you enter a search term. Any Alerts in the heat map that include the search term appear in their usual colors, and all other Alerts are grayed out. This makes it easy to pinpoint and open the desired Alerts in the card carousel (see below).


 If you enter a search term and press Enter, the card carousel opens and shows cards for all Alerts corresponding to the search term.


 The following screenshot shows an example of using search. The user has searched for the term "mark." Three results are returned. Two of these are for new people (both named "Mark") and one is for a trending card called "Marketing Inquiries." All three are shown in the heat map—two are green (those corresponding to new people) and one is purple (the one corresponding to the trending card).

|
|
 Heat map
  |
 Provides a dynamic, ever-changing visual representation of your Domo Alerts. The heat map continually updates as new Alerts fly in from the hopper. There are a number of colors of Alerts, each of which corresponds to a topic category. For example, "New people" Alerts appear green; "Suggested" and "Subscribed" Alerts appear orange; and "Trending" Alerts appear purple.


 If you mouse over a square in the heat map, the action freezes and all squares belonging to that category appear colorized, while squares in all other categories are grayed out. This is shown in the following screenshot, in which the user has moused over a green square:

If you click a square in the heat map, the Alerts in that category open in the card carousel (see below).
  |
|
 Hopper
  |
 Shows new Alerts in your Domo instance as they fly into the heat map.


 There are a number of colors of Alerts, each of which corresponds to a topic category. For example, "New people" Alerts appear green; "Suggested" and "Subscribed" Alerts appear orange; and "Trending" Alerts appear purple.


 If you mouse over an Alert in the hopper, the action freezes and all squares in the heat map belonging to that category appear colorized, while squares in all other categories are grayed out.


 If you click an Alert in the hopper, the Alerts in that category open in the card carousel (see below).

####
 Card Carousel

When you click a topic category, heat map square, or hopper Alert, or when you perform a search, the card carousel opens. Usually this displays cards for all Alerts pertaining to the given category. The exception to this is when you perform a search, in which case the card carousel shows cards for all Alerts that include your search term. All Alert cards have options, such as subscribing to an Alert, adding a trending cards as a favorite, and so on. The specific options available for an Alert card depend on the topic category.


 In the following example, the user has clicked on an orange "Suggested Alert" square in the heat map. The card carousel opens to show cards for all suggested Alerts, with the Alert the user clicked on appearing in the center and the others flanking it.

Note that although options appear on all cards in the carousel, they are only clickable in the center card.


 You can navigate through Alerts in the carousel by clicking the left and right navigation arrows on either end of the carousel, or close the carousel by clicking the "x" in the top right corner.


 Options available for each topic category are as follows:
