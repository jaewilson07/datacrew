In addition to the flow of an item, the Sankey chart captures the relative size of the flow itself by changing the line width from node to node.\u00a0For more information, see our\n                        \n                         Sankey Chart\n                        \n                        article.\n                       \n\n                        Sankey charts consist of nodes, or end points, and colored arrows or lines. See below for a simple Sankey chart.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The original Sankey chart is ideal for physical flows that go to a destination once per flow,\u00a0like energy and materials. However, it's not ideal for recursive concepts like web traffic, where flows need to circle back to previous nodes and require special treatment to display properly. To meet these needs, Domo has created the circular Sankey chart.\n                       \n\n                        The following image emphasizes the chart's circular reference:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Powering Circular Sankey Charts\n                       \n\n                        A circular Sankey chart requires each of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          A `From` dimension\n                         \n                         \u2014 The source of the flow.\n                        \n\n\n                          A `To` dimension\n                         \n                         \u2014 The destination of the flow.\n                        \n\n\n                          A value\n                         \n                         \u2014 The size of the flow.\n                        \n\n                       For information about value, category, and series data, see our\n                       \n                        Understanding Chart Data\n                       \n                       article.\n                       \n                        In Analyzer, you can choose the columns containing the data for your circular Sankey chart.
