With Domo, you can combine data from multiple sources into a single platform--pulling data from product development, marketing, sales, operations, and finance for a real-time, holistic view of your business. Once your data is in Domo, you can get stunning, dynamic JIRA visualizations with real-time data, on any device.\n\n\n Domo's JIRA connector allows you to connect to your JIRA account to extract data from JIRA. You can import data including issue tracking, completed tickets per team, ticket resolution time, and project management metrics, using either custom or predefined queries. To learn more about the JIRA API, see\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/jira...e-query-issues\n\n.\n\n\n The JIRA Rest API Connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your JIRA account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the JIRA connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Tracking progress and movement of tickets\n* Number of tickets assigned to specific users or groups\n* Seeing if too many tickets of a certain type are open (bugs)\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Bug / issue / ticket tracking (by age, type, status, submitter)\n* Completed tickets per team\n* Ticket resolution time\n* Project management metrics (tracking individual tasks of a larger project or epic).\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Product managers\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n This can vary wildly depending on the implementation and the user's level of knowledge of their JIRA\u00a0system.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 7\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* You should usually use \"Replace\" with the JIRA connector, as \"Append\" does not work well.\n* If the query is for data across a long time period, scheduling should be kept to a minimum (once a day). For shorter queries, more frequent updates are appropriate.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your JIRA account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password/API key you use to log into JIRA. The\n\nJira cloud users must use an API Key. You can create one here:\n\nhttp://id.atlassian.com\n* The URL for your company's JIRA instance\n* The JQL query you will use to pull data (if you are building a custom report)\n\nCredentials are received upon account creation. A JIRA\u00a0Admin is likely to have created username and passwords for most users in your company if you use\u00a0an on-premise JIRA implementation.\n\n##\n SSO\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) credentials will NOT work.\u00a0However, you can work around SSO limitations by doing the following:\n\n. Have your JIRA administrator create a local account with a username and password specifically for API use.\n2. Create an API key at\n\nhttp://id.atlassian.com/\n\n.\n3. On the JIRA connector page in Domo, enter the API key you created instead of the password. (Depending on the account, you may need to enter your username or JIRA account email address as the username.)\n\nConnecting to Your JIRA Instance\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the JIRA Rest PAI Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your JIRA instance. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your JIRA instance.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to log into your JIRA instance. The\n\nJira Cloud users must use an API Key. You can create one here:\n\nhttp://id.atlassian.com\n\n\n |\n|\n Server URL\n  |\n\nEnter the URL for your JIRA instance (for example,\n\nonjira.mycompany.com\n\n).\n\n|\n\nOnce you have entered valid JIRA credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new JIRA Rest API DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\nAccounts\n\ntab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n\n*Reports**\n\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\n\n report you want to run.

This connector requires a local username and password.\n\n###\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |  |\n Endpoint URL(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Agile API:\n  |\n Agile Boards\n  |\n /rest/agile/1.0/board\n  |\n|\n Board Sprints\n  |\n /rest/agile/1.0/board/{boardId}/sprint\n  |\n|\n Sprint Issues\n  |\n /rest/agile/1.0/board/{boardId}/sprint/{SprintId}/issue\n  |\n|\n Fields\n  |  |\n /rest/api/2/field\n  |\n|\n Group Members\n  |  |\n /rest/api/2/group/member\n  |\n|\n Issue Query\n  |  |\n /rest/api/2/search\n  |\n|\n Projects\n  |  |\n /rest/api/2/project\n  |\n|\n Project Versions\n  |  |\n /rest/api/2/project/{projectId}/versions\n  |\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the username, password, and server URL for your Jira instance.\n\n###\n Domo is reporting that my Jira credentials are invalid. What am I doing wrong?\n\nPossible reasons for this error include:\n\n Your Jira server has not had API access enabled. Contact your Jira administrator to ensure that API access is turned on.\n* You're using your email address instead of your actual Jira username. In many cases, these may be the same; however, it's not uncommon for \"\n\nuser.name@company.com\n\n\" to be your email while \"\n\nuser.name\n\n\" is your actual username.\n\n\n####\n Can I use my SSO account to login?\n\nSSO implementations are not supported in Jira. However you can work around these limitations.\n\n Jira Server \u2013 Your Jira administrator can create a local account with a user name and password specifically for API use.\n* Jira Cloud \u2013 You can create an API key at\n\nATLASSIAN\n\n. On the connectors page, enter the API key you\u2019ve created instead of the password.\n\n\n Note: Depending on your account, you may need to enter your username or your Jira account email address as the username.\n\n\n####\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nData from Jira's servers is usually made available to the API immediately.\n\n###\n How do I know if my query is right?\n\nJira's platform provides a handy tool to verify if your query is valid. An easy way to access this tool is simply to do a search in Jira's search bar. Once on the search screen, you will see a green check box next to the query string for your search to indicate that it is valid. Otherwise you will see a red X. You can switch back to the basic search functionality to build a query from the available selectors, and then switch again to advanced to see the resulting query.\n\n###\n I keep running into connection errors (gateway timeout, bad gateway, connection timed out, connection reset, etc...). How do I fix that?\n\nThe most common cause of connection errors is that your Jira server has too much load to handle your requests. Contact your Jira administrator to see about allocating more resources to your Jira server.\n\n###\n Can this connector pull custom fields?\n\nBecause Jira returns so much data, the connector enables you to specify fields either as inclusive or exclusive. If you choose inclusive, only the fields you specify will be returned. If you choose exclusive, all fields will be returned except for those that you specify.\n\n\n**Note**\n : Field ids must be entered. If the field names are entered, then they will be ignored.\n\n###\n How can I pull the data from boards?\n\nSelect the report type as\n **Agile API**\n and the agile report as\n **Agile Boards**\n to get the list of all agile boards you have access to.\n\n###\n Can I use OAuth on this connector?\n\nIf you wish to use OAuth on Jira instances, use the Jira Cloud connector. Jira Cloud connector supports OAuth2 authentication. You can authenticate to the Jira Cloud connector with the same credentials you use to log into your Jira account online.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Jira requires a fair amount of configuration from the side of the JIRA\u00a0admin to ensure that API access is enabled. Common issues include setting the timeouts too short\u00a0or not providing sufficient resources to the JIRA server.\n* If users have trouble understanding how to format JQL, the easiest thing is to log into the JIRA front end. Via the search bar, JIRA provides a tool that can construct a JQL query with preset filters. After constructing your query, if you hit the\n **Advanced**\n button, JIRA\u00a0presents you with your selections\u00a0in JQL format.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434973\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003416\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nJIRA Rest API Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,212\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "jira_rest_api_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
