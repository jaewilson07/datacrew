Use Domo's Amazon Athena JDBC 2.0 connector to query data from your Athena instance. Use Domo's Amazon Athena JDBC 2.0 connector to visualize your Amazon Athena data using JDBC 2.0. To learn more about the Amazon Athena API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/athena/\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your Amazon Athena account in the Data Center.
