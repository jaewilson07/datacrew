You can use Domo's Microsoft SharePoint Online REST Connector to get the data from an organization-wide intranet portal in different aspects based on sites within Domo.\u00a0To do this, you must first create an app in Microsoft Azure. For more information about the Microsoft Sharepoint Online, visit their website at\n\nhttps://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-online-collaboration-software\n\n.\n\n\n You create a Microsoft Sharepoint Online connection\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Sharepoint Online REST connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to Microsoft Sharepoint Online in order to retrieve information, you must have the following:\n\n An installed Microsoft Azure app.\n* The secret ID and value for your Azure app. To generate an app and locate these credentials, see\n\nMicrosoft's documentation\n\n. You may need the following information to register for the app:\n\n+ **Azure Portal:**\n\n https://portal.azure.com/\n\t+ **Sharepoint App to Register:**\n\t SharePoint Online Rest API\n\t+ **Domo Re-direct URL:**\n\n https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/microsoft-sharepoint/exchange\n\n##\n\nTo Obtain the Sharepoint Secret ID:\n\n\n1. Go to\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n2. Select\n **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**\n\n.\n3. Find and click on your web app.\n4. The \"application\" ID is your secret ID.\n\n\n###\n\nTo obtain the Sharepoint Value:\n\n\n1. Go to\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n2. Select\n **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**\n .\n3. Find and click on your web app.\n4. Open\n **Certificates and secrets**\n .\n5. Click\n **+New Value**\n .\n6. Provide the value description and the expiry period for your secret. Click\n **Add**\n .\n7. Your new value will appear. Copy the Value field and paste it in your Domo connector Value field.\n\n\n###\n\nCreating an Azure App\u00a0for Enterprise OAuth\n\nTo create a Microsoft Azure app, do the following:\n\n. Log into\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n2. Click on\n **App registrations**\n\n.\n3. Click\n **New registration**\n\n.\n4. Enter the application name and select the supported account type. Enter the Redirect URI for Web as\n\n\n https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/microsoft-sharepoint/exchange\n\n.\n5. Click\n **Register**\n\n.\n6. Now, click\n **API Permissions**\n\n.\n7. Click\n **+Add Permissions**\n\nbutton.\n8. S\n\nelect\n\n*Microsoft Graph > Delegated Permissions**\n\n.\n9. Select the permissions as required.\n10. After adding the permissions, all configured permissions will be listed as below.\n\n\n Connecting to Microsoft Sharepoint Online\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Microsoft Sharepoint Online REST Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n``\n**Note:** Use Microsoft Account that has The Cloud Application Administrator role in admin.microsoft.com\n```\n\n##\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to a Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation via Azure.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003922\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMicrosoft Sharepoint Online REST Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 7,026\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "microsoft_sharepoint_online_rest_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "file_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaowGAC"}]}
