These tools include the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           New Chart Picker\n                          \n                          . You can now change the chart type for most charts right in the Details page instead of having to first open the Card Builder. In contrast to the chart type picker in Card Builder, which only shows icons for each chart type, the Details view chart type picker shows you actual thumbnail versions of each available chart type with your chart data already applied.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Legend Item Toggle\n                          \n                          . In most chart types with legends (excluding Maps), you can now click on a legend item to hide or show the corresponding data in the chart.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Chart Zoom\n                          \n                          . You can click and drag over a portion of a chart to \"zoom in\" on that portion. This works on most chart types, excluding pie-type charts, maps, gauges, Radar graphs, and a few others.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Quick Sort\n                          \n                          . For most Bar and Line graphs, you can now quickly change the sort method just by clicking an icon, without having to open the Card Builder.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Chart Save As\n                          \n                          . When you make changes to a chart in the Details view (whether by using any of the above features or filtering using the Analyzer tool), you can now save a copy of the edited chart to your Domo. You can then give the new version of the card a new name, enter a description to help viewers understand what has been changed in the card, and select the page in Domo where the new card will reside.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Data Forecasting\n                          \n                          . A new chart property for Bar and Line charts allows you to forecast the value of the remainder of the current period in your chart. It does this by taking the current value for the period and comparing it to the previous period.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Bulk Admin Options for Pages and Cards\n                       \n\n                        At long last, \"Admin\" users in Domo now have the ability to make bulk edits to the pages and cards in their company Domo instance! With this capability in place, users of your Domo instance will no longer need to waste time manually moving, deleting, and setting permissions on cards and pages, freeing them up to tackle more important tasks like answering the needs of your business.\n                       \n\n                        The\n                        \n                         Cards\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         Pages\n                        \n                        tabs in the Admin Settings have been completely revamped to allow you to make bulk changes with ease.

You can even select all of the cards or pages in your instance if you want to make changes to all of them. For any page or card, you can click anywhere in the row to bring up a tab with more information.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Bulk options for pages\n                       \n\n                        Bulk options for pages include all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Changing page owners\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Adding and removing users and groups\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Moving pages in the hierarchy (includes options for setting permissions on moved pages)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Locking and unlocking pages\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Deleting pages\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Bulk options for cards\n                       \n\n                        Bulk options for cards include all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Changing cards owners\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Adding and removing users and groups\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Duplicating cards\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Adding and removing cards to/from pages\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Locking and unlock cards\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Deleting cards\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For information about these options, see\n                        \n                         Admin Settings Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Domo Online Form v2\n                       \n\n                        The online forms (webforms) tool has been improved to provide more options for manually creating DataSets in Domo.
