To learn more about the Box API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.box.com/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Box Governance account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Box Governance connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Box account and create a Box Governance DataSet, you must have your Box username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Box Account\n--------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Box Governance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Box Governance connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Box Governance accounts in Domo) to open the Box OAuth screen where you can enter your Box credentials. Once you have entered valid Box Governance credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Box Governance DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Box when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Box.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Box Governance report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n File Classification Report\n  |\n Lets you retrieve data about File Classification policies.\u00a0These policies\u00a0provide\u00a0the ability to classify content and drive security settings based on that classification.\n  |\n|\n Legal Hold Reports\n  |\n Lets you retrieve either of two different Legal Hold subreports.
