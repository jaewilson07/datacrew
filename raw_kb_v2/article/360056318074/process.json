Use this information together with data from DomoStats to find out how your organization is using Domo. Use the Domo Governance Datasets Connector to integrate your Domo Governance Datasets data in minutes.\n\n\n You import Domo Governance DataSets\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Domo Governance Datasets\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo pull in Domo Governance DataSets using this connector, you need your Customer Name and Domo API Key.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Domo Governance Account\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the\u00a0Domo Governance\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Domo Governance\u00a0DataSets\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Customer\n  |\n Enter your customer name. Your customer name is the part in the URL that before .\n\ndomo.com\n\n. Ex: If your Domo instance is located at\n\nhttps://some-customer.domo.com\n\n, then your customer name is \"some-customer\".\n  |\n|\n Domo Access Token\n  |\n Domo Access Token. See\n\nManaging Access Tokens\n\nfor details.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Domo Governance\u00a0DataSets\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Domo Governance\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n**Important:**\n Using the Domo Governance DataSets will make the owner of the token show in the Activity Logs that they have visited every Card and Dashboard every day.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n ****Reports****\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Domo Governance DataSets report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Beast Modes\n  |\n Contains the definitions of all beast modes in your Domo instance. The report is divided into two sections. The first section contains all beast modes saved to the dataset. The second section contains all beast modes that exist only on the card. If the beast mode is used in the card's summary number and\u00a0also saved to the dataset, it will appear in this section as well.\n\n\n****Fields****\n :\u00a0Card ID,\u00a0Card Title,\u00a0Dataset ID,\u00a0Dataset Name,\u00a0Beast Mode ID,\u00a0Beast Mode Name,\u00a0Beast Mode Formula,\u00a0Beast Mode Status,\u00a0Beast Mode Saved to Dataset,\u00a0Beast Mode Applied to Summary Number\n  |\n|\n Beast Modes with Fields\n  |\n Similar to the Beast Modes report with an additional field. Contains the definitions of all beast modes in your Domo instance. The report is divided into two sections. The first contains all beast modes saved to the dataset. The second contains all beast modes that exist only on the card. If the beast mode is used in the card's summary number but is also saved to the dataset, it will also appear in this section.
