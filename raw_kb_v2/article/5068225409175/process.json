Magento allows access to hundreds of unique features that help to connect with wide range of customers. Use the Domo Magento 2 Advanced connector to pull your data about the customers, invoices, orders, products, shipments and more from your Magento 2 system.\n\n\n By combining your data with Domo, you can create powerful visualizations and reports to analyze your invoices, products, and shipments. Combine your Magento data with all your information on Domo and plan for future business demands.\n\nTo learn more about the Magento REST API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v...arted-api.html\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Magento account in the Data Center.
