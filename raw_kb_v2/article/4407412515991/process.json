Use Domo\u2019s Emarsys Contacts Writeback connector to export your contacts data from a Domo dataset to your Emarsys account.\n\nTo learn more about the\n\nEmarsys\n\nAPI, visit their page\n\nhttps://dev.emarsys.com/v2/emarsys-developer-hub/what-is-the-emarsys-api\n\n.\n\n\n You configure your Domo-\n\nEmarsys Contacts\n\nconnection in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nEmarsys Contacts\n\nWriteback Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this Connector, you must have the following:\n\n Your Domo developer account client ID and client secret\n* Your Emarsys Contacts username and secret\n\n\n#####\n To obtain your Domo developer credentials, do the following:\n\n\n1. Log into the\n\nDomo developer account\n\n.\n2. In the top right corner under\n **My Account**\n click\n **New Client**\n .\n3. Enter the application name and description.\n4. Provide the application scope by selecting the checkboxes for\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n\nOnce you have created a client, you can manage the client by clicking on\n **Manage Client**\n .\n\n\n Configuring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nEmarsys Contacts Writeback\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nEmarsys Contacts\n\naccount where you want your data to be copied to. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n\nEnter your Domo client ID.\n\n|\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n\nEnter your Domo client secret.\n\n|\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Emarsys Contacts username.\n  |\n|\n Secret\n  |\n Enter your Emarsys Contacts secret.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Emarsys Contacts Writeback DataSet.
