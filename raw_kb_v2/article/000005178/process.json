A fundamental part of Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the addition of a hierarchical namespace to Blob storage. Use this connector to bring-in data from Azure storage into Domo for creating visual insights on the data. Azure Data Lake Gen2 OAuth WriteBack connector provides file system semantics, file-level security, and scale.\u00a0It makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on Azure. It allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data and helps to speed up your transition from proof of concept to production. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is a set of capabilities dedicated to big data analytics, built on\u00a0Azure Blob storage. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the result of converging the capabilities of the two existing storage services, Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1.\u00a0Use Domo's prebuilt Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 WriteBack connector that connects with Azure Active Directory to export your data from a Domo dataset to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.\u00a0For more information about Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2, see\n                        \n                         https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        You export data to a Azure Data Lake Gen2 in the Data Center.
