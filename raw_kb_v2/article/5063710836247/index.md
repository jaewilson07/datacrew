QuickBooks is an accounting software used to help small businesses accept payments, pay bills, and complete payroll. With Domo you can combine multiple QuickBooks accounts through a one-click authentication process, providing you with consolidated reporting across multiple metrics. Using Domo and QuickBooks together gives you customizable dashboards that you can create by integrating your QuickBooks data with essential marketing, sales, or operational data.


 Once your data is in Domo, you can give stakeholders financial transparency with powerful and flexible charts, visualizing things like balance sheets, profit and loss, vendor balances, and more. And you can access all your data in real time, from any device. Easily see all your QuickBooks accounts in one dashboard, with real-time updates, so you can make better decisions for your business.
