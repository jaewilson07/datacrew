This is because\u00a0if you pull these metrics in a different granularity when the numbers are rolled up, they will no longer be accurate. For example, say we have a visitor to our site, Visitor 1. This individual visits the site once a day for a week. When we go to report how many people visited the site in a week, if we pull the data using a day granularity, Visitor 1 is\u00a0counted 7 times. However, if we pull the data using\u00a0a week granularity, Visitor 1 is only\u00a0counted once, giving us an accurate count of how many individuals visited the page in a week but NOT how many times the site was visited.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            API Explorer\n                           \n\n\n                           Adobe Analytics has an API Explorer that you can use to run your report and check the results.

Why is this happening and what can I do about it?\n                           \n\n\n                           A: Adobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see\n                           \n                            Adobe documentation\n                           \n                           for details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username: Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication. Please contact Adobe support to request a resolution to this issue.\n                          \nNote: JWT connector which is recommended by Adobe does not need to authenticate after two weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Q: Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?\n                           \n\n\n                           A: It is best if your account has the Admin access. At the very least you need access to the report suites you want as well as access to retrieve elements, metrics and segments from the API.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Q: My Adobe\u00a0Analytics OAuth datasets are failing intermittently and displaying unhelpful error messages like\u00a0\"Unable to complete report at this time. Please try again later.\" What should I do?\n                           \n\n\n\n                            A: This error originates on\n                           \n\n                            Adobe\n                           \n\n                            \u2019s end. Unfortunately, it is nothing we at Domo have direct control over, but we are working with\n                           \n\n                            Adobe\n                           \n\n                            to improve these types of errors. That said, you can take steps to alleviate the occurrence of these errors, which include reducing the number of connectors, the frequency at which they try to pull data, and the size of their requests. Attempting to schedule requests to run at different times can also help. Another possible solution is to use the \u201cretry\u201d setting in the connector.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Q: What do I do if I need to include more than 4 elements in my Adobe Analytics OAuth DataSet?\n                           \n\n\n\n                            A: Run Adobe's Data Warehouse reports. These do not use the Domo connector; rather they leverage scheduled emails to import data into Domo. These reports can use SFTP. Note that results may vary slightly from the Adobe Analytics front end.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Q: My report takes a long time. How do I speed up my report?\n                           \n\n\n                           A: In case of the Intermediate-Custom report, the number of elements selected and the parameters in the Additional Element Information text box can make a big difference in your report performance. Select the minimum number of elements needed.\n                          \n\n                           It is also possible to have a number of reports queued up in Adobe Analytics that is preventing your report from being finished. You can use the Queue report to see what reports are currently being processed by Adobe.\n                          \n\n                           If you have a large number of\u00a0datasets, try to stagger their execution times so that the datasets will not clog up Adobe's queue all at once.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Q: Is there a way to see what data is being returned from the Adobe Analytics API?\n                           \n\n\n                           A: Adobe Analytics has an API Explorer that you can use to run your report and check the results.
