Domo's Adobe Analytics Advanced connector allows you to retrieve data through prebuilt reports or\u00a0customized reports or by submitting a query to the Adobe Analytics API.\u00a0You can then combine metrics with data from CRM, POS, or any other system to make faster, better-informed business decisions. To learn more about the Adobe Analytics API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/en\\_US/documentation\n\n)\n\n\n You connect to the Adobe Analytics API in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Adobe Analytics Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Marketing and web analytics\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n Visits, page views, unique visitors, etc.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Analysts and executives\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n ~60 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 8\n  |\n\nAPI Limitations\n-----------------\n\n\n* Only 1 Report Suite can be selected for a given report.\n* Adobe only allows 4 elements per request.\n* Up to 30 metrics\u00a0can be selected.\n* Segments are mutually exclusive.\n* The API returns only the top ten results for an element by default, based on the first selected metric selected.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to the Adobe Analytics and create a DataSet, you must have the Client ID and\u00a0Client Secret associated with your\u00a0Adobe Analytics account.\n\n\n Visit\n\nAdobe Oauth Connection\n\ndocumentation to learn more about obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret.\n\n##\n\nCreating\u00a0a new OAuth project in Adobe Developer Console\n\nTo create a new OAuth project in Adobe Developer Console, do the following:\n\n\n 1. Log into\n\nhttps://console.adobe.io/projects\n\n.\n\n\n 2. Click\n **Create new project**\n button.\n\n3. Click on\n **Add API**\n to start using\u00a0the Adobe services.\n\n4. The APIs available to you will be listed in the\n **Add an API**\n window. Select\n **Adobe Analytics**\n .\n\n5. Now, you need to select the authentication type. Select\n **OAuth**\n here.\n\n6. Select the\n **Web**\n platform to configure the API.\n\n\n Enter the\n **Default redirect URI**\n as\n **https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v2/oauth/providers/adobe-analytics-oauth/exchange**\n\n\n Enter the\n **Redirect URI pattern**\n as\n **https://oauth/.domo/.com/api/data/v2/oauth/providers/adobe-analytics-oauth/exchange**\n\n\n 7.

The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to the Adobe Analytics API. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter the client ID\u00a0associated with your\u00a0Adobe Analytics account.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter the client secret\u00a0associated with your\u00a0Adobe Analytics\u00a0account.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Adobe Analytics 1.4 OAuth DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n\n**Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\nThis pane contains two primary menus,\n\n\n**Report Suite**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Report Type**\n , along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n###\n\nPrimary Menus\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Company\n  |\n Enter your company's name as featured on Adobe Analytics, which is used as a parameter for the\u00a0Company.GetEndpoint\u00a0method (see\n\nhttps://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/admin-api/methods/company/r\\_GetEndpoint.md\n\n)\n  |\n|\n Report Suite\n  |\n Select the Adobe Analytics Report Suite you want to pull data from.\n  |\n|\n Report Type\n  |\n Select a report type. The report type determines the set of inputs needed\u00a0to configure the DataSet.\n\n\n Report types are as follows:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Easy - Predefined\n  |\n Lets you select from a number of predefined Adobe Analytics reports.\n  |\n|\n Intermediate - Custom\n  |\n Lets you specify the elements, metrics, segments,\u00a0and date-time information for your report.\n  |\n|\n Advanced - Query\n  |\n Lets you\u00a0pull data using\u00a0an Adobe Analytics Web Service API Explorer Query.

For a list of report types, see the next section.\n  |\n|\n Backfill\n  |\n Select the number of days back that should backfill the first time the report is run.\n  |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a predefined report. These reports are available\n\n\n*only*\n\n\n when you select\n\n\n**Easy - Predefined**\n as your\n\n\n**Report Type**\n .\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Base Metrics\n  |\n Returns data about page views; average time spent on website; unique visitors by month, week, and day; new visitors; etc.\n  |\n|\n Commerce Metrics\n  |\n Returns data about number of visits, orders, checkouts, revenue, new and returning customers, etc.\n  |\n|\n Existing Customer Campaigns\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, and revenue, broken down\u00a0by existing customer campaign.\n  |\n|\n Existing Customer Products\n  |\n Returns data about existing customer visits, orders, checkouts, and revenue, broken down\u00a0by product.\n  |\n|\n Mobile Device Types\n  |\n Returns data about mobile views, visits, and daily unique visitors, broken down\u00a0by device type.\n  |\n|\n Mobile Metrics\n  |\n Returns metrics about mobile device usage, such as device type, OS, views, visits, and daily unique visitors.\n  |\n|\n Natural Search Conversion\n  |\n Returns\u00a0data about number of visits, orders, and revenue, broken down by natural search keyword.\n  |\n|\n Natural Search Visits\n  |\n Returns data about number of visits, page views, and\u00a0daily unique visitors, broken down by natural search keyword.\n  |\n|\n New Visitor Best Campaigns\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, revenue, and units, broken down by new visitor campaign.\n  |\n|\n New Visitor Geo\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, revenue, and units, broken down by region.\n  |\n|\n New Visitor Geo Country\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, revenue, and units, broken down by country.\n  |\n|\n New Visitor Keywords\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, revenue, and units, broken down by paid search keyword.\n  |\n|\n New Visitor Products\n  |\n Returns data about new customer visits, orders, checkouts, revenue, units, etc., broken down by product.\n  |\n|\n New Visitor Traffic\n\nSource\n  |\n Returns data about\u00a0visits, orders, revenue, and units, broken down by referrer type.\n  |\n|\n Page Effectiveness\n  |\n Returns data about page\u00a0visits, entries and exists, bounces, and bounce rate, broken down by page.\n  |\n|\n Page Metrics\n  |\n Returns data about page views, visits, daily unique visitors, and exists, broken down by page.\n  |\n|\n Paid Search Conversion\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, and revenue, broken down by paid search keyword.\n  |\n|\n Paid Search Visits\n  |\n Returns data about page views,\u00a0daily unique visitors, and visits, broken down by paid search keyword.\n  |\n|\n Products and Categories\n  |\n Returns data about visits, orders, and revenue, broken down by product and category.\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n####\n\n\"Intermediate - Custom\" Report Type Options\n\n\n|\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Elements\n  |\n Select\u00a0up to four element names.\n\n\n An\n\n\n*element*\n\n\n is a structure that breaks down a report's metrics data. For example, you can generate a report that breaks down page views (metric)\u00a0by the\u00a0browsers used to access the page (element). The resulting report lists page views by\u00a0browser type.\n\n\n By default\u00a0the Adobe Analytics API only returns the top 10 elements. If you want to\u00a0view more, you can do so by entering information for the additional elements in the\n **Additional Element Information**\n field.\n\n\n For more information about elements, see\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/elements\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Additional Element Information\n  |\n Enter any additional element information using the JSON format defined in the API Explorer (\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/api-explorer#Report.Queue\n\n).\n\n\n For example:\n\n\n`{\"top\":50,\n\n\"selected\":[],\n\n\"classifications\":[],\n\n\"id\":\"page\",\n\n\"name\":\"Page\"}`\n\n\n This parameter is described in detail later in this topic:\n\nUnderstanding\u00a0the Additional Elements field\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Segments\n  |\n Select\u00a0segment definitions for your report. You can select as many segments as you want. For more information about segments, see the API Explorer documentation (\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/api-explorer#Report.Queue\n\n).\n\n\n**Note:**\n Although you have the ability to select as many segments as you would like, be cautious about what those segments are doing to the overall picture of your data. Selecting segments will change the grouping of your data and can lead to unexpected results.\n\n\n |\n|\n Inline Segments\n  |\n Enter inline segment information using the JSON format defined in the API Explorer (\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/api-explorer#Report.Queue\n\n).\n\n\n Inline segments allow\u00a0you to create a segment in the connector without having to define it first in Adobe Analytics. For example, if I wanted to segment (filter) the data to show only the Home Page and Shopping Cart, I would populate the inline segmentation window with the below JSON snippet.\n\n\n`{\n\n\"id\": \"page\",\n\n\"selected\": [\"Home Page\", \"Shopping Cart\"]\n\n}`\n\nYou can also apply logic to your filtering.\n\n\n For more information about inline segments, see\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/sitecatalyst-reporting/c-segments\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Metrics\n  |\n Select\u00a0up to 30 metrics for your report. For more information about Adobe Analytics metrics, see\n\nhttps://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/reporting-api/metrics.md\n\n.\n\n\n Some combinations of metrics will lead to errors. Adobe has provided a list of metrics that are blacklisted from being used together.\n\n\n https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/reporting-api/combinations.md\n\n|\n|\n Date Granularity\n  |\n Select a date grain for the report. This determines whether\u00a0the data is broken down by day, by week, etc.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Specify whether the data in this report is for a single date or a range of dates.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the data in the report is for a specific\u00a0date or for a relative\u00a0date based on the selected\n **Date Granularity**\n .\u00a0For\u00a0example, if you selected\n\n\n**Date Granularity > Day**\n , you could select\n\n\n**Today**\n\n\n as\u00a0your report date. Then,\u00a0each time the data updated, it would show date for the current date.\n  |\n|\n Date Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of periods back that will be used to offset your relative date. The period is based on your selected\u00a0Date Granularity.\n\n\n For example, if you selected\n **Date Granularity > Day**\n and\n **Report Date > Yesterday**\n , then entered\n\n2\n\nfor\n\n\n**Date Offset**\n , the report would pull data for three days in the past (yesterday minus two days).\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Date From\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n\n\n**Date To**\n . Options in these menus are determined by the selected\n **Date Granularity**\n .\n\n\n For example, if you\u00a0selected\n **Date Granularity > Week**\n ,\u00a0you could then select\n **Date From > Last Week**\n\n\n and\n **Date To > This Week**\n .\u00a0Each time your report updated, it would then show data for\u00a0this week as well as last week.\n  |\n|\n Date To\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0last date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the first date in your range in\n\n\n**Date From**\n . Options in these menus are determined by the selected\n **Date Granularity**\n .\n\n\n For example, if you\u00a0selected\n **Date Granularity > Week**\n ,\u00a0you could then select\n **Date From > Last Week**\n\n\n and\n **Date To > This Week**\n .\u00a0Each time your report updated, it would then show data for\u00a0this week as well as last week.\n  |\n|\n Date From Offset\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0number of periods\u00a0back that will be used to offset the first date in your date range. The period is based on your selected\n **Date Granularity**\n .\n\n\n For example, if you selected\n **Date Granularity > Week**\n and\n **Date From > Last Week**\n , then entered\n\n2\n\nfor\n **Date From Offset**\n , the first date in the date range would be set to three weeks\u00a0in the past (last week minus two weeks).\n  |\n|\n Date To Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of periods back that will be used to offset the\u00a0last date in your date range. The period is based on your selected\n **Date Granularity**\n .\n\n\n For example, if you selected\n\n\n**Date Granularity > Week**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Date\u00a0To > This Week**\n , then entered\n\n2\n\nfor\n\n\n**Date To Offset**\n , the last date in your date range would be set to two weeks in the past (this week minus two weeks).\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date From\n  |\n Select the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date To\n  |\n Select the last date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Time Zone\n  |\n Select the UTC time zone for your data.\n  |\n|\n Include All Time Zones\n  |\n Check this box if you want all time zones included in your report.\n  |\n|\n Backfill\n  |\n Enter the number of periods back (based on the selected\n\n\n**Date Granularity**\n ) that should backfill the first time the report is run.\n  |\n\n\n####\n\n\"Advanced - Query\" Report Type Options\n\n\n|\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter\u00a0an Adobe Analytics Web Service API Explorer Query to pull data for your report. For more information about queries, see\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/api-explorer#Report.Queue\n\n.\n\n\n For example:\n\n\n`{\"reportDescription\":{\n\n\"reportSuiteID\":\"thankyoudev\",\n\n\"dateFrom\":\"2014-09-07\",\n\n\"dateTo\":\"2014-09-07\",\n\n\"dateGranularity\":\"Day\",\n\n\"elements\":[\n\n{\"top\":50,\n\n\"selected\":[],\n\n\"classifications\":[],\n\n\"id\":\"page\",\n\n\"name\":\"Page\"}],\n\n\"metrics\":[\n\n{\"decimals\":0,\n\n\"id\":\"pageviews\",\n\n\"name\":\"Page Views\"},\n\n{\"decimals\":0,\n\n\"id\":\"visits\",\n\n\"name\":\"Visits\"}],\n\n\"segments\":[],\n\n\"locale\":\"en_US\"}}`\n |\n\n##\n\nOther Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\n\n\n a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Understanding The \"Additional Elements\" Field\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following JSON snippet contains all of the code needed to utilize the\n\n\n**Additional Elements**\n parameter\u00a0of the connector. You just need\u00a0to replace\n\n\n*string*\n\n\n &\n\n\n*int*\n with the values you\u00a0choose. You can also delete the sections of this JSON that you will not be using. Examples on\u00a0how to use this will be discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"id\":\"\n *string*\n \",\n\n\n \"classification\":\"\n *string*\n \",\n\n\n \"top\":\"\n *int*\n \",\n\n\n \"startingWith\":\"\n *int*\n \",\n\n\n \"search\":{\n\n\n \"type\":\"\n *string*\n \",\n\n\n \"keywords\":[\n\n\n \"\n *string*\n \"\n\n\n ],\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n\n###\n\nUsing Additional Elements to Increase Your Top Results\n\nBy default, the Adobe Analytics API only return the top 10 results for the selected element. You can increase the number of top results using\n\n\n**Additional Elements**\n . For example, to\u00a0increase the limit to 100 you would add the following to the\n **Additional Elements**\n field:\n\n\n`{\u201ctop\u201d:100,\n\n\n \u201cid\u201d:\u201dpage\u201d}`\n\n\n*\"*\n id\"\u00a0is the ID of the element you want. There\u00a0is no upper limit to the \u201cTop\u201d number but\u00a0the less you pull back in using\u00a0the query, the more efficient it will be. You can do this for multiple\u00a0elements by separating them with a comma.\n\n\n`{\u201ctop\u201d:100,\n\n\n \u201cid\u201d:\u201dpage\u201d},\n\n\n {\u201ctop\u201d:100,\n\n\n \u201cid\u201d:\u201dregion\u201d}`\n\n##\n\nUsing Additional Elements to Search for Keywords in Elements\n\nYou can use\n\n\n**Additional Elements**\n to search for keywords in elements by inputting properly formatted JSON. You can search using AND, OR, and NOT operators.\u00a0Below is a table that describes these operators.\n\n\n Value\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n AND\n  |\n Combines multiple search terms to return results that have all of the search keywords.\n  |\n|\n OR\n  |\n Combines multiple search terms to return results that match any of the search keywords.\n  |\n|\n NOT\n  |\n Excludes the selected keywords from the search results.\n  |\n\nThe following example searches for the\u00a0top three pages that have \u201chelp\u201d OR \u201cfaq\u201d in the page name/URL. You can also do an AND\u00a0search by replacing the \u201cOR\u201d with \u201cAND\u201d.\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"id\": \"page\",\n\n\n \"top\": 3,\n\n\n \"search\": {\n\n\n \"type\": \"OR\",\n\n\n \"keywords\": [\"help\",\"faq\"]\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n\n You can also use special characters like the following to increase the power of your search:\n\n\n Special Character\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n \\*\n  |\n Wild Card. Add to the beginning or end of keywords (e.g.\n\npage\\*.html\n\n).\n  |\n|\n ^\n  |\n Starts With. Add to the beginning of your keyword/string to find results that start with this keyword/string (e.g.\n\n^http://\n\n).\n  |\n|\n $\n  |\n Ends With. Add to the end\u00a0of your keyword/string to find results that end\u00a0with this keyword/string (e.g.\n\n.html$\n\n)\n  |\n\nHere is an example of a search that uses these characters:\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"id\": \"page\",\n\n\n \"top\": 3,\n\n\n \"search\": {\n\n\n \"type\": \"OR\",\n\n\n \"keywords\": [\u201chelp*\",\"^faq\"]\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n\n Exact keyword matches can be obtained by placing the \"starts with\" and \"ends with\" special\u00a0characters at\u00a0the beginning and ending of the keyword:\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"id\": \"page\",\n\n\n \"top\": 3,\n\n\n \"search\": {\n\n\n \"type\": \"OR\",\n\n\n \"keywords\": [\"^faq$\"]\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n##\n\nAdding Classifications to the JSON\u00a0Syntax\n\nIf you wish to do any of the above advanced functions with a SAINT Classification then you\u00a0need to add the classification to the JSON syntax, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"id\": \u201cpage\",\n\n\n \u201cclassification\u201d:\u201dregion\u201d,\n\n\n \"top\": 3\n\n\n }`\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n------------------\n\n##\n\nUnique Metrics\n\nOne of the most frequently encountered issues with the Adobe Analytics connector involves unique metrics, such as Unique Visitors, Unique Pageviews, etc.\u00a0Unique metrics are non-additive and need to be pulled from the connector at the same level of granularity they will be viewed at. This is because\u00a0if you pull these metrics in a different granularity when the numbers are rolled up, they will no longer be accurate. For example, say we have a visitor to our site, Visitor 1. This individual visits the site once a day for a week. When we go to report how many people visited the site in a week, if we pull the data using a day granularity, Visitor 1 is\u00a0counted 7 times. However, if we pull the data using\u00a0a week granularity, Visitor 1 is only\u00a0counted once, giving us an accurate count of how many individuals visited the page in a week but NOT how many times the site was visited.\n\n##\n\nAPI Explorer\n\nAdobe Analytics has an API Explorer that you can use to run your report and check the results. It is available at\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/api-explorer\n\n.\n\n\n Tips and Tricks\n------------------\n\n\n* Make sure to leverage the Additional Element Information field,\n\n\n as explained above.\n* Classifications are identified by an \u201c->\u201d in the Element list.\n* The fewer elements per data source, the better.\n* Try and stay below 10 metrics per data source.\n* Stagger the runtimes of your data sources.\n* Learn how to use the Adobe Analytics API explorer.\n* Reference the Adobe API documentation (URL is provided under\n\nHelpful Links\n\n).\n* Segments will lengthen runtimes.\n* Although you have the ability to select as many segments as you would like, be cautious about what those segments are doing to the overall picture of your data. Selecting segments will change the grouping of your data and can lead to unexpected results.\n* sProps and eVars cannot be pulled together.\n\n\n FAQ\n------\n\n\n####\n\nQ: When should I use this connector?\n\n\n A: Connect your customer insight data to Domo using V1.4 of Adobe's API and authenticating using OAuth.\n\n###\n\nQ: I successfully created an Adobe Analytics OAuth account, but about two weeks later I got an alert: \"Account Adobe Analytics OAuth Account has been Deactivated\". Why is this happening and what can I do about it?\n\nA: Adobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see\n\nAdobe documentation\n\nfor details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username: Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication. Please contact Adobe support to request a resolution to this issue.\n\n\n```\n**Note:** JWT connector which is recommended by Adobe does not need to authenticate after two weeks\n```\n\n###\n\nQ: Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?\n\nA: It is best if your account has the Admin access. At the very least you need access to the report suites you want as well as access to retrieve elements, metrics and segments from the API.\n\n###\n\nQ: My Adobe\u00a0Analytics OAuth datasets are failing intermittently and displaying unhelpful error messages like\u00a0\"Unable to complete report at this time. Please try again later.\" What should I do?\n\n\n A: This error originates on\n\n\n Adobe\n\n\n \u2019s end. Unfortunately, it is nothing we at Domo have direct control over, but we are working with\n\n\n Adobe\n\n\n to improve these types of errors. That said, you can take steps to alleviate the occurrence of these errors, which include reducing the number of connectors, the frequency at which they try to pull data, and the size of their requests. Attempting to schedule requests to run at different times can also help. Another possible solution is to use the \u201cretry\u201d setting in the connector.\n\n\n####\n\nQ: What do I do if I need to include more than 4 elements in my Adobe Analytics OAuth DataSet?\n\n\n A: Run Adobe's Data Warehouse reports. These do not use the Domo connector; rather they leverage scheduled emails to import data into Domo. These reports can use SFTP. Note that results may vary slightly from the Adobe Analytics front end.\n\n\n####\n\nQ: My report takes a long time. How do I speed up my report?\n\nA: In case of the Intermediate-Custom report, the number of elements selected and the parameters in the Additional Element Information text box can make a big difference in your report performance.
