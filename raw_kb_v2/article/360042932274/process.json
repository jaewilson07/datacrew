Use this connector to export your data from a Domo DataSet to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. To find out more about the Google Cloud Storage API, visit\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json\\_api/\n\n.\n\n\n You export data to Google Cloud Storage in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Cloud Storage\u00a0Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need the following:\n\n A Domo Client ID and Client Secret. To obtain these credentials, do the following:\n\n1. Log into your Domo developer account at\n\n https://developer.domo.com/login\n\n .\n\t2. Create a new client\n\n .\n\t3. Select the desired data and user application scope.\n\t4. Click\n\t **Create**\n\t .\n* A Google Service Token JSON\u00a0file. To obtain this file, do the following:\n\n1. Open the\n\n Google Cloud Platform Console\n\n .\n\t2. In the\n\t ****Service account****\n\t menu,\u00a0select\n\t ****New service account****\n\t .\n\t3. In the\n\t ****Service account name****\n\t field, enter a descriptive name for the account.\n\t4. In the\n\t ****Role****\n\t dropdown, select\n\t ****Project owner****\n\t .\n\t5. Make sure\n\t ****Key type****\n\t is set to\n\t ****JSON****\n\t .\n\t6. Click\n\t ****Create****\n\t .\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google Cloud Storage\u00a0Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account as well as your Google Cloud Storage bucket. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID.\u00a0For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.\u00a0For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Service Token JSON\n  |\n Paste the JSON\u00a0Service Token you generated in the Google Cloud Platform Console. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Google Cloud Storage\u00a0connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Project\n  |\n Enter the API ID of the project\u00a0you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Bucket\n  |\n Select the bucket in which you want to store the data.\n  |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to S3. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n|\n Select Filename\n  |\n Select whether you want to reference your DataSet\u00a0using the\n **Input DataSet ID**\n or an output file name.\n  |\n|\n Filename\n  |\n Enter the output file name for your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932274\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004039\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle Cloud Storage Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,716\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:19 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_cloud_storage_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
