In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other File connectors by clicking\n                        \n                         File\n                        \n                        in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n                       \n\n                        There are two versions of this connector, a regular and an advanced version. The only difference between these is that the advanced version asks you for the username and password for the Domo instance you are copying from. Because of this, we do not provide separate documentation for the advanced version.\n                       \n\n                        This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DataSet Copy\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n                        \n                         Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        To copy data from one instance to another, you must have the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The access\u00a0token for the DataSet you are copying data from. This token belongs to the owner of the DataSet you are copying data from. If you have an \"Admin\" security role, you can generate access tokens; otherwise, you need to request an access token from an administrator.\u00a0Make sure the token is not expired. For information about generating access tokens, see\n                          \n                           Managing Access Tokens\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The Domo instance containing the DataSet you want to copy.
