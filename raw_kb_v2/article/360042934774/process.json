New filters enable you to use information that you know about what you are searching for without requiring you to use a keyword. For instance, what if you are looking for a card and you can\u2019t remember the card name, but you know it was created recently by a teammate? By filtering based on owner and creation date, you can quickly discover the latest cards created by your teammate in a matter of seconds.\n\n\n With a revamped search engine, keywords match not just on titles anymore; as you type, the engine goes deeper to match on descriptions, owner names, column names in DataSets, and even down to the content inside a document card.\n\n\n Also, when you open an item from the Search window, clicking the Back button returns you to the Search, making it easy to quickly view different items from the same search.\n\n\n Ultimately, you now have ways to find content in Domo when you need it, helping you get insights in real time and make smarter decisions.\n\nThe new global search functionality is available in both the web and mobile versions of Domo.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nSearching in Domo\n\n.\n\n##\n New Alert Center\n\nDomo\u2019s revamped Alert Center puts all of the interesting, important, and actionable insights from your data at your fingertips, resulting in faster responses to real opportunities. Effective business leaders manage their organizations using metrics and goals to help ensure consistent progress and optimized performance. Domo helps businesses draw insights from more data sources than ever before. As the volume of data businesses harvest continues to grow, an organization\u2019s ability to properly analyze all of the complex relationships in their data diminishes, but as of today, Domo\u2019s all-new Alert Center fills this essential gap.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAlert Center Layout\n\n.\n\n##\n New Version of Getting Started with Domo App\n\nDomo has created a new and improved\u00a0introductory training app called \u201cDomo Basics: Getting Started with Domo.\u201d\u00a0The previous \u201cGetting Started with Domo\u201d app has been revised\u00a0using\u00a0a\u00a0brand new learning interface and has been updated with the latest training content. The new\u00a0version\u00a0is designed to help new and existing Domo users learn the basics about using Domo to drive value within their organization and to introduce the steps that they need to take in order to execute against their desired outcomes.\n\n\n The new version of the app includes the following features:\n\n **Navigation Pane**\n .
