You can use Domo\u2019s\u00a0ArcSight connector to\u00a0pull Report Service and Query Viewer service reports.\u00a0To learn more about ArcSight, visit their page (\n\nhttps://h41382.www4.hpe.com/gfs-shared/downloads-273.pdf\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your ArcSight account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the ArcSight connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your ArcSight account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password for your\u00a0ArcSight account\n* The hostname and port number for your ArcSight server\n* The report ID if you are retrieving a Report Service report, or the query ID if you are retrieving a Query Viewer Service report\n\nConnecting to Your ArcSight Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the ArcSight Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your ArcSight account.
