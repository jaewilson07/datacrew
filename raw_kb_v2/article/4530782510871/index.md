Drag-and-Drop Apps bring the power of the Appstore to your Dashboard. You can now add Domo Bricks right from your dashboard editor, so you no longer have to go back and forth from the Appstore to your dashboard—you can stay in context with the rest of your dashboard content while adding cards from the Appstore.
