Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nYou can create new columns in DataSets in Workbench 4 by building calculations based on the data in other columns. For example, you\u00a0might\u00a0have a column containing\u00a0values with one or more decimal places.\u00a0You could create a new column in which\u00a0all of the values in the original column are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number,\u00a0using the\n\nCEILING\n\nor\n\nFLOOR\n\nfunctions, respectively. Workbench 4 contains over 80 such functions you can use in constructing calculations. Categories of\u00a0functions include logical (such as\n\nAND\n\n,\n\nNOT\n\n,\n\nIF\n\n, etc.), mathematical (such as\n\nACOS\n\n,\n\nRND\n\n, and\n\nSUMLIST\n\n), statistical (such as\n\nAVERAGE\n\n,\n\nMAX\n\n, and\n\nSTDEV\n\n), text (such as\n\nCONCATENATE\n\n,\n\nMID\n\n, and\n\nSUBSTITUTE\n\n), and date and time (such as\n\nDAY\n\n,\n\nEOMONTH\n\n, and\n\nTODAY\n\n). You can find descriptions of all of the functions in the Workbench 4 user interface.\n\n*Training Video - Creating Columns in Workbench Using Calculations**\n\nLearn how to create new Workbench columns using calculations.\n\n\n You build calculated fields for a selected DataSet job in the\n **Calculation Builder.**\n You access the\n **Calculation Builder**\n for a DataSet by adding a\n **Calculation**\n transform.\n\nTo add a calculated field in Workbench 4,\n\n. In the\n **Accounts**\n pane, select\u00a0the DataSet job you want\u00a0to add a calculated field\u00a0to.\n2. In the\n **Transforms**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window, click\n **Add New**\n .\n3. In the\n **Transform Type**\n menu, select\n **Calculation**\n then click\n **Next**\n .\n4. Click\n **Finish**\n .\n\n\n A\n **Calculation**\n item is added under\n **Transforms**\n for this DataSet job.\n5. Click the new\n **Calculation**\n item under\n **Transforms**\n .\n\n\n The\n **Calculation Builder**\n opens in the Dynamic Options panel.\n6. Enter a name for the calculation in the\n **Column Name**\n field.\n7. Build your calculation in the\n **Calculation**\n field using the column names in the\n **Available Fields**\n listing and the functions in the\n **Available**\n**Functions**\n listing.\n\n\n You can add column names and functions to a calculation by double-clicking them in the list.\n\n\n You can filter the functions by category by selecting the desired category in\u00a0the\n **Category**\n menu. All functions\u00a0are accompanied by descriptions; you can see\u00a0the description for a function by clicking that function. In addition, each function shows its proper usage. For example, the\n\nSUM\n\nfunction is represented as\n\nSUM (p1, [p2],...).\n\nThis means that you\u00a0are summing the values in all referenced columns, which are indicated by\n\np1\n\n,\n\np2\n\n, and so on.\n8. Click\n **Validate**\n to ensure that\u00a0your calculation is valid.\n\n*Note:**\n In calculations, column names\n *cannot*\n contain non-ASCII characters. You can reference a column in a calculation using\n\nColumn#\n\nwhere\n\n#\n\nis the 1-based column order. For example:\n\nCONCATENATE(Column2,Column3)\n9. Click\n **Save**\n in the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window\n **.**\n\nYour DataSet\u00a0now contains the new\u00a0column based on your calculation.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360046861474\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004770\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCreating Columns in Workbench 4 Using Calculations\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 11,630\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "creating_columns_in_workbench_4_using_calculations", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
