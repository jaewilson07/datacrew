Use this connector to pull data files from your OneDrive account into Domo. You can retrieve data files in any of the following file types: CSV, XLS, XLSX, XML, ZIP, and GZIP. For more information about the OneDrive API, see\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/lib.../dn659752.aspx\n\n.\n\n\n The Microsoft OneDrive connector is a \"File\" connector, meaning it retrieves files and outputs them to Domo. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other File connectors by clicking\n **File**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You set up the connection to your Microsoft account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the OneDrive connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft account and create a OneDrive DataSet, you must have a Microsoft username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Microsoft Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Microsoft OneDrive Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Microsoft OneDrive connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Microsoft OneDrive accounts in Domo) to open the Microsoft screen where you can enter your Microsoft username and password. Once you have entered valid Microsoft credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new OneDrive DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Microsoft when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Microsoft.\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Microsoft credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new OneDrive DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the OneDrive report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Children\n  |\n Lists the children of the item with the specified file/folder or path.\n  |\n|\n DefaultDrive\n  |\n Returns metadata about the authenticated user's default drive in OneDrive.\n  |\n|\n DownloadFile\n  |\n Downloads a file to into Domo as a DataSet.
