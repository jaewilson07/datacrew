In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your Conductor Searchlight account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is good for retrieving search engine optimization (SEO) metrics.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Keyword rankings\n* Competitor rankings\n* Search volume\n* Tracked searches\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Digital marketing\n* SEO analyst\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 5 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nThese reports can power cards individually, but sometimes it is helpful to combine the reports using Magic ETL so you can look at metrics like your keyword ranks compared to your competitor ranks, or to evaluate the search volume of your top ranked keywords. For more information about Magic ETL, see\n\nMagic Transforms\n\n\n .\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The\u00a0API key\u00a0for your\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0account\n* The\u00a0Shared Secret\u00a0for your\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0account\n\n\n For questions, please contact your Conductor Searchlight account representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0Account\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Conductor Searchlight Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\n*Field**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nAPI Key\n\n|\n\nEnter the API key for your Conductor Searchlight account.\n\n|\n|\n\nShared Secret\n\n|\n\nEnter the Shared Secret for your Conductor Searchlight account.\n\n|\n|\n\nAPI Version\n\n|\n\nSelect the Conductor Searchlight API version specific to the API Key and Shared Secret you've entered.\n\n|\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu,\u00a0along with various menus that may or may not appear depending on the selected report.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect the\u00a0Conductor Searchlight\u00a0report you want to run.
