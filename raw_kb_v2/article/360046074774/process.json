This simple, yet powerful, DataSet Views experience allows you to perform data cleansing operations such as filtering, grouping, aggregating, and even combining data through a simple visual interface. Anyone with an Admin user or a Custom Role that has either the \"Edit DataSet\" or \"Manage DataSet\" grants enabled can use DataSet Views.

Columns can be removed by selecting the triple dot menu on each column and selecting\n                        \n                         Delete\n                        \n                        . To remove multiple columns, you can also choose the\n                        \n                         Select All\n                        \n                        option from the columns on the left and the delete icon.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Add Columns\n                       \n\n                        In certain situations, it makes sense to add a duplicate of a column to your DataSet. To add columns to the DataSet, choose the\n                        \n                         Add Column\n                        \n                        button at the bottom of the columns on the left.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Rename Columns\n                       \n\n                        Rename a column by selecting the triple dot menu on a column and choosing\n                        \n                         Rename\n                        \n                        . This can also be done in by using the columns on the left.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Move Columns\n                       \n\n                        Reordering columns can be done in two places. To move a column select the\n                        \n                         Move\n                        \n                        option in the triple dot menu and selecting one of the four options:\n                        \n                         Left\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Right\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         First\n                        \n                        ,\u00a0or\n                        \n                         Last\n                        \n                        . You may also drag and reorder columns by using the columns on the left.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Add Calculated Column\n                       \n\n                        To add a new calculated column choose the plus sign and select\n                        \n                         Add Calculated Column\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        When you have finished writing the calculation, select\n                        \n                         Save and Close\n                        \n                        . This will automatically add the new calculated column to your DataSet in Views Explorer. For the new calculated column to save to your DataSet, you will need to save your DataSet as a new DataSet View.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Perform Joins\n                       \n\n                        To join DataSets using Views Explorer, toggle to the DataSet side of the schema rail. From there, select the\n                        \n                         Add Join\n                        \n                        button.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Next, select a DataSet to join and choose the Join Keys from each DataSet.
