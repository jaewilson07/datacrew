This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BrassRing connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your BrassRing account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The API URL domain for your BrassRing account. For example:\n\nhttps://stagingimport.brassring.com\n* Your BrassRing Sender ID.\n* Your BrassRing Credential.\n* Your BrassRing Client ID.\n* Your BrassRing Site ID.\n\nConnecting to Your BrassRing Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the BrassRing Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your BrassRing account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API URL\n  |\n Enter the API URL domain for your BrassRing account.\n  |\n|\n Sender ID\n  |\n Enter your BrassRing Sender ID.\n  |\n|\n Credential\n  |\n Enter your BrassRing credential.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your BrassRing Client ID.\n  |\n|\n Site ID\n  |\n Enter your BrassRing Site ID.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid BrassRing credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new BrassRing DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains only two configuration options\u2014a\n **Report**\n menu (which currently contains only one report) and a field where you enter your XML envelope content.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the desired BrassRing report. Currently only one report type is available.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n XML Envelope\n  |\n Lets you post custom-created XML envelope content to the BrassRing API.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n XML Envelope\n  |\n Enter the BrassRing XML envelope to POST to the API. The envelope content must be valid and well-formed XML. For more information on constructing the XML envelope, please see BrassRing API documentation at\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21995062\n\n.\n\n\n Credential fields in the XML envelope MUST be aliased in the following format:\n\n\n|\n Credential\n  |\n Alias\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Sender ID\n  |\n\n{{senderID}}\n\n|\n|\n Credential\n  |\n\n{{credential}}\n\n|\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n\n{{clientID}}\n\n|\n|\n Site ID\n  |\n\n{{siteID}}\n\n|\n\n\n To get an idea of how an envelope is constructed, you can look at the example envelope provided in the BrassRing connector UI.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043432493\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003650\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBrassRing Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,365\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "brassring_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
