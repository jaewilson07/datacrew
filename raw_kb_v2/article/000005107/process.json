Domo provides connectors that allow you to pull data from a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection and compile custom reports.\n\n The MongoDB connector\u00a0uses Java driver version 3.2.1,\u00a0and\u00a0supports Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB connector.\n* The MongoDB Advanced connector uses Java driver version 3.2.1, and\u00a0supports a plain JSON query. You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB\u00a0Advanced connector.\n* The\u00a0MongoDB SSH Connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports\u00a0Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB SSH connector. You need your SSH credentials (host, port, username, and password)\u00a0to pull data from a MongoDB collection\u00a0through an SSH tunnel.\n* The MongoDB V2 connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports Find and Aggregate query methods. You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB V2 connector.\n* The MongoDB Replicaset connector uses Java driver version 3.12.11, and supports compilation of custom reports using JSON queries.\n\nThis article discusses the\n **MongoDB\u00a0Replicaset Connector**\n . You can use Domo's\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0ReplicaSet connector to pull data from\u00a0a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting JSON query filter. For more information about the\u00a0MongoDB API, go to\n\nhttp://api.mongodb.org/\n\n.\n\n\n The MongoDB\u00a0ReplicaSet Connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n ****Database****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0V2 ReplicaSet Connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Important:**\n An SSL connection is required for this connector to work.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your\u00a0MongoDB database\n* The host name for the database server (e.g.\n\ndb.company.com\n\n).\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n* (optional) CA certificate\n\n\n**Note:**\n MongoDB uses \"admin\" as the database name to establish a connection.\n\nBefore you can connect to a MongoDB\u00a0database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your MongoDB\u00a0Collection\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nMongoDB\u00a0V2\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to\n\na collection within a MongoDB\u00a0V2 database\n\n. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Connection String\n  |\n Enter the connection Url for your MongoDB.\n\nUse <username> and <password> as placeholder for your actual username and password.\n\nmongodb://<username>:<password>@examphost1:port1,examphost2:port2/?connectionParam1=value1&connectionParam2=value2..*  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0password.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Format\n  |\n Select a certificate format. This must match what you enter in the Certificate field. If you are not aware of a special certificate, select No Certificate.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located. By default, no certificate is required.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid MongoDB\u00a0V2 credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new MongoDB V2 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create a JSON query to pull data from your MongoDB collection. You can also create optional\u00a0WHERE,\u00a0SELECT,\u00a0GROUP, and\u00a0SORT\u00a0clauses, and apply the query filter to find documents in the collection, also in JSON format.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n How would you like to select your collection name?\n  |\n Specify whether you want to select a collection or enter it manually.\n  |\n|\n Which database would you like to use to get the data?\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you want to connect to a database other than the one where authentication occurs or use the same database.\n\n|\n|\n Enter database name\n  |\n\nEnter the name of the MongoDB database you want to connect to.\n\n|\n|\n Select collection name\n  |\n\nSelect the name of the MongoDB collection.\n\n|\n|\n Enter collection name\n  |\n\nEnter the name of the MongoDB collection.\n\n|\n|\n Query Method\n  |\n Select a query method to pull data from your MongoDB collection.\n  |\n|\n Find\n  |\n A JSON Query will execute by 'Find Method'.\n  |\n|\n Aggregate\n  |\n A JSON Query will execute by 'Aggregate Method'.\n  |\n|\n JSON Query Filter\n  |\n Enter the query filter to find documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Limit Row\n  |\n Enter the number of rows you want to be returned.\n  |\n|\n Batch Size\n  |\n Batch size is the number of documents to be returned per batch which is used internally by the connector. Enter the batch size greater than 1.\n  |\n|\n Query Type\n  |\n Select which query filter to be used to aggregate documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Enter Query Filter\n  |\n Select \"Enter Query Filter\" to manually enter the JSON\u00a0Aggregate Query Filter\n  |\n|\n JSON\u00a0Aggregate Query Filter\n  |\n Enter the query filter to aggregate documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Custom Query Clause\n  |\n Select \"Custom Query Clause\" to aply the custom clauses such as\n\nwhere\n\nclause,\n\nselect\n\nclause,\n\ngroup\n\nclause, and\n\nsort\n\nclause\n  |\n|\n Where Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nWHERE\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Select Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nSELECT\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Group Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nGROUP\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Sort Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nSORT\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Use MongoDB Collection Schema\n  |\n Select this checkbox to use the MongoDB collection schema for the dataset.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 000005107\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005107\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMongoDB ReplicaSet Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 1,785\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 1/31/2023, 4:28 AM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 1/31/2023, 4:28 AM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mongodb_replicaset_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
