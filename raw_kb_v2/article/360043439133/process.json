Supported languages include:\n\n Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Japanese\n* Portuguese\n* Simplified Chinese\n* Spanish\n\n\n**Video - Domo Language Settings**\n\n\n Set the Global Language\n-------------------------\n\nYou can change the global language for the Domo user interface\u00a0in the browser version as well as in mobile applications.\n\n##\n Web Version\n\nUsers with an Admin default security role or a custom role with the Manage All Company Settings grant enabled can configure the global language for their instance by going to\n **More >**\n**Admin > Company settings > Company overview > Language**\n then selecting the desired language. To save the setting and apply it for all users you must click the\n **Save**\n button. This changes the user interface language for all users. We recommend that you notify your users before changing the language settings.\n\n\n###\n Mobile Version\n\nThe language for the Domo mobile applications on iOS and Android match the language of the device. To change the language of the application you must change your device language. If you use a language that is not currently supported, the application will default to English.\n\n\n Set the Language for an Individual User\n-----------------------------------------\n\nFor Domo\u00a0users whose primary language differs from the global language set by their company, Domo provides the ability to set the interface language on a user basis. You can make this change in either of two places:\n\n The Domo login screen, or\n* the user settings screen, available by clicking your profile picture and then clicking the globe/gear icon.\n\nTo set your individual user language from the Domo login screen, select your desired language from the language menu under the login panel.\n\nFollow these steps to set your individual user language from the user\n **Settings**\n :\n\n. In the navigation header, select\u00a0your profile picture.\n2. Select\n\n*Settings**\n .\n\n\n The user\n **Settings**\n page displays.\n3. Under\n **Language**\n expand the menu to view the available languages and select the language you want.\n\n*Note:**\n If this option is locked it means your company has included\n **Locale**\n as a managed attribute. To get this changed, contact your Domo admin.\n\nThis changes the user interface language to match that of the language you have selected. Formatting conventions based on your region will also now be used to display numerical, financial, and date/time values based on your region. You can reset the language at any time by selecting\n **Reset to Company Settings**\n .\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043439133\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003055\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nConfigure User Language in Domo\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,007\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:09 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "configure_user_language_in_domo", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "administrating_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamlGAC"}, {"text": "specifying_company_settings", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoGGAS"}]}
