To learn more about Firebase, visit their website at\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/Firebase/\n\n.\n\n\n You export data to a\u00a0Firebase collection\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Firebase Writeback\u00a0Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need the following:\n\n A Domo Client ID and Client Secret. To obtain these credentials, do the following:\n\n1. Log into your Domo developer account at\n\n https://developer.domo.com/login\n\n .\n\t2. Create a new client\n\n .\n\t3. Select the desired data and user application scope.\n\t4. Click\n\t **Create**\n\t .\n* The name of your Firebase Realtime Database.\n* A Firebase\u00a0database secret. To generate a Firebase database secret:\n\n1. Log into the Firebase console.\n\t2. Click on your project.\n\t3. Click\n\t **Project Overview**\n\t .\n\t4. In the settings gear menu, select\n\t **Project Settings > Service Accounts > Database Secrets > Add Secret**\n\t .\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Firebase Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account as well as the collection in your Firebase database where you want your data to be copied to. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.\n  |\n|\n Database Secret\n  |\n Enter your Firebase database secret. For more information about obtaining a database secret, see \"Prerequisites\" above.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter the name of your Firebase Realtime Database.\n  |\n\nFor more information about obtaining these credentials, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\nOnce you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Firebase connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to Firebase. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n|\n Select Collection Name\n  |\n Select how you want to indicate the collection\u00a0where the data will be copied.\n * **Use Input DataSet\u00a0GUID**\n . The table name will be the number you entered for\n **DataSet ID**\n .\n* **Use Input DataSet\u00a0Name**\n . The table name will be the same as that of the input DataSet.\n* **Enter Collection\u00a0Name**\n . You will give the table a custom name in the\n **Collection\u00a0Name**\n field.\n |\n|\n Collection\u00a0Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the collection\u00a0in your Firebase database where you want your DataSet data to be copied.\n\n\n For example, enter just\n\nABC\n\nto indicate a collection that is the immediate child of the root.\n\n\n To enter a location that is not a direct child of the root, use forward slashes, e.g.\n\nABC/DEF\n\n.\n\n\n Illegal characters include\u00a0all of the following:\u00a0.$[]#\"\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDataSets should be set to update no more than once every 15 minutes.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nWhile Firebase\u00a0may enforce API rate call limits, you should not need to worry about them.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932254\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004038\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nFirebase Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,688\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:19 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "firebase_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
