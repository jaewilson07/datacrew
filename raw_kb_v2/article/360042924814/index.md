Intro
-------

An outliers chart is nearly identical to a basic line chart but allows you to call out any points you deem to be outliers. Be aware that the line in an outliers chart is built from X and Y coordinate pairs,
 *not*
 from date-time values as in a typical line chart. However, you can use numbers to represent time periods. For example, in the graphic further down in this topic, the numbers in the "X-axis" column represent months in a time scale.


 This chart type does
 *not*
 currently include algorithms to identify outlier points. You must identify these points yourself in the DataSet you use to power the chart. However, you can use tools such as R and Python to help you identify these outliers.


 Powering outliers charts
--------------------------

Outliers charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet. Two of these contain the X and Y coordinate values for each point, as in a

scatter plot chart

. The third column contains a value of

TRUE

or

FALSE

for each coordinate pair. If the point is considered an outlier, the value should be

TRUE

; if it is not an outlier, the value should be

FALSE

. For an example, see the graphic below.

 In the Analyzer,Â you choose the columns containing the data for your outliers chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see

 The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into an outliers chart. (For clarification purposes, the values in the "X-Axis" column represent months.)
