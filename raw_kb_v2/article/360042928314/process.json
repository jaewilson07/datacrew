On that date, MWS will no longer be able to connect to Amazon to obtain data for orders, merchant fulfillment, and reports. If you are currently using the MWS connector, you need to migrate to Domo's Selling Partner (SP) connector on or before September 12, 2022 to continue to get Amazon Marketplace data.

By using the Domo Amazon Marketplace Web Services Connector, sellers can increase selling efficiency, reduce labor requirements, and improve response time to customers. To learn more about the Amazon MWS API, visit their page (\n                            \n                             https://developer.amazonservices.com/\n                            \n                            ).\n                           \n                           You connect to your Amazon MWS account in the Data Center.

Make sure you set this report to \"Append,\" never to \"Replace.\" It will pull 1 day of the current data. Then, if it has time left in the 22-hour window, it will begin to get data, starting with now and going backwards, and will stop when it can't get any more data in 22 hours. The next day it runs to get the one day of the current append, and then starts again to fill in the historical data.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Amazon has very heavy throttles.

If you make more than that, the DataSets will fight over the API calls and you won't get data as fast.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Don't go back in backfill for more than a few years. It will take a long time to get that data, and it probably isn't relevant to get sales on Amazon products from 3 years ago.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          These reports ABSOLUTELY have to be set to \"Append.\" \"Replace\" does not behave well in this model.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        To connect to your Amazon MWS account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          An MWS\u00a0Auth\u00a0Token\n                         \n\n\n\n                          An Amazon Seller ID\n                         \n\n\n\n                        To find your Amazon Auth\u00a0Token and Seller ID, do the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Navigate to\n                          \n                           https://sellercentral.amazon.com/apps/manage\n                          \n                          and log in.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Authorize New Developer\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Register Domo Inc. with developer ID \"181964952887\" for JP or developer ID \"473744043762\" for CA, US, and MX then click\n                          \n                           Next\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Check the box and click\n                          \n                           Next\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        You are taken to a screen with your Seller ID, the MWS Auth Token, and the Marketplaces you have access to.

How do I get all of my orders, inventory and other important Amazon MWS data?\n                       \n\n                        You will need to create an account for each marketplace. We recommend naming the accounts with the marketplace location: for example, 'United States' or 'Italy'. Once you have created the needed accounts, create connector datasets using each account to receive the data that matters to you. If you would like to join the data, use Domo's Magic ETL or Dataflow tools to bring the different marketplaces together.\n                       \n\n                        How should I configure the Orders or Order Items report?\n                       \n\n                        Due to API limitations, the connector can only be set up with Append mode. To set up the connector with Append mode:\n                       \n\n\n                         Select the desired start date for your historic backfill, and use a relative end date with a value of 'yesterday' or '1'.\n                        \n\n                         Set the connector to only run once per day.\n                        \n\n\n                        The connector will get the most current day's data, then start getting backfill data from the most recent data to older, one day at a time. The connector will run up to 24 hours, and then will remember where it left off in the historical backfill. The next day, when the connector runs again, it will get the most current day's data appended to it first, then pick up where it left off with the historical backfill. This pattern will continue until the connector has received all data for the historical backfill. Once all the backfill is completed, it will continue to append the most current day's data, one day at a time. If the connector doesn't run or is unsuccessful during a run, it is designed to receive the data it missed in both the current and historical backfill.\n                       \n\n                        Can Domo schedule Amazon MWS\u00a0Reports on my behalf?\n                       \n\n                        No. The connector is not able to schedule Amazon MWS Reports on your behalf in the Amazon MWS API. The connector will deliver all reports in the discovery drop-down for your convenience, but you may receive a \"Report not generated\" error if the report is not generated. The error message will contain the name of the report in Amazon MWS that needs to be generated before the connector can run successfully. Generate the report and add it to the report scheduler in your Amazon MWS dashboard and try again. The connector report 'Reports - Schedule List' lists all scheduled reports.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042928314", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
