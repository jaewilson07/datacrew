The Data Warehouse\u00a0gives you\u00a0quick insight into the breadth of your data and also allows\u00a0you to drive into the depth of individual data providers. You can then\u00a0take\u00a0your newly gained insights and take effective action on a specific data source or create new data source where a gap was discovered.\n\n\n The\u00a0Data Warehouse\u00a0provides a three-dimensional visual representation of all data sources and Magic connectors in your Domo, along with data currently flowing into and between them.\u00a0These are represented as stacks on a rotating palette.\u00a0You can configure the order and height of the stacks to indicate different metrics.\n\n#####\n Data Warehouse main view\n\n\n Mousing over a stack causes the palette to\u00a0stop rotating, and an information panel appears for the data source or Magic connector. This panel shows information such as the number of DataSets for the data source or connector, the number of cards built, the number of successful and failed runs, etc.\n\n\n You can click and drag the panel to\u00a0move it manually. The panel can be\u00a0moved in three dimensions.\n\n\n Stacks are colored differently depending on their type and current activity. Green indicates a functional data source, blue indicates a Magic connector,\u00a0orange indicates a warning state for a data source, and red indicates that one or more DataSets\u00a0for a data source\u00a0is broken and needs immediate attention.\n\n\n The arrangement of stacks around the palette and the height of the individual stacks\u00a0indicate\u00a0specified metrics. By default, stack arrangement indicates status and stack height indicates the number of rows of data. If you want, you can change the criteria determined by arrangement and height.\u00a0For example, you could set the arrangement\u00a0of stacks around the palette to indicate the number of cards built using the\u00a0data\u00a0source or Magic connector\u00a0and the height of the stacks to indicate the number of DataSets.\n\n\n Clicking a connector stack\u00a0changes the view to show three-dimensional representations of all DataSets for the connector. This view also shows the data sources, the number of DataSets, and the number of rows for the data source or connector.\n\n#####\n Connector stack view for The Data Warehouse\n\n\n For information about The Data Warehouse, see\n\nUsing The Data Warehouse to Manage Data\n\n.\n\n##\n Workbench 4\n\nWorkbench\u00a0version 4 is here.\u00a0The latest version of Domo Workbench provides a clean and intuitive user experience that will help you get the most out of Workbench.

The Buzz panel now displays only the first and last comments in each conversation in chronological order; however,\u00a0you can expand any particular conversation to show only that conversation in its entirety. You can also filter the feed activity to show only discussions that are connected to a trending topic, card, or project.\n\n\n In addition, you can now do all of the following in Buzz:\n\n @ mention the users or groups you want to see your message\n* @\u00a0mention cards or projects you want to reference in the message\n* reference specific users, cards, groups, or projects using @\u00a0or popular topics using #\n* add new hash tags #\n* select images for URLs\n* attach documents and images by selecting from the browser, dragging and dropping, or entering the image URL\n* attach YouTube videos that can be played inline\n* navigate through previews of referenced cards using a card carousel\n* filter by browse mode or trending topic, card, or project\n* specify a post as public or private\n* \"mute\" discussions\u00a0so you\u00a0don't receive notifications when\u00a0new comments are added to that discussion\n\n\n######\n Buzz - Main panel\n\n\n######\n Buzz - New discussion\u00a0view\n\nFor more information about Buzz, see\n\nBuzz\n\n.\n\n##\n Notifications\u00a0Management\n\nNotifications provide a way for you to know when important things happen in Domo that demand your attention.\u00a0The new\n **Manage Notifications & Alerts**\n page in Domo gives you the flexibility to determine how, when, and which\u00a0notifications come to you. This page lets you set options for Notifications, Instant Alerts, Daily Alerts, and Weekly Alerts.\n\n\n In the\n **Notifications**\n tab, you can toggle global settings for receiving notifications via email, mobile app, or SMS.

Customers should visit the Help Center to register for webinars and/or public courses.\n\n\n###\n Improved document card\n\nThe document card has been\u00a0updated with a\u00a0number of exciting new capabilities. Now you can make Domo the place where all of your documents are stored so you can collaborate around them, compare them with data, and easily view the version history. You'll know exactly when a file has been updated, and you'll never have to leave Domo to view your documents.\n\n\n New document card features include the following:\n\n The ability to show your\u00a0actual document in Domo, rather than just a placeholder.\n* A number of new supported file types, including images. (Image cards will still be available in Domo with all of the same functionality before; however, they will gradually be phased out\u00a0as more and more users switch to using document cards to\u00a0display images.)\u00a0All of these file types will be available for use in document cards:\n\n+ PDF\n\t+ DOCX\n\t+ DOC\n\t+ XLSX\n\t+ XLS\n\t+ PPTX\n\t+ PPT\n\t+ TXT\n\t+ PNG\n\t+ JPG\n\t+ BMP\n* A maximum upload file size of 100 MB.\n* A\u00a0panel in the document card\n **Details**\n view in which old versions of the document are stored as thumbnails. You can see any old version of the document by clicking its thumbnail, as well as delete any version.\n* A document preview mode with standard and full-screen viewing modes, page navigation controls, and a download icon.\n* An option that allows you to receive notifications when a document card you have added as a Favorite gets a new version.\n\n\n######\n Document Details view\n\n\n######\n Document preview\u00a0mode\n\nFor more information about document cards, see\n\nAdding a Document Card to Domo\n\n.\n\n##\n Ability to change page owner\n\nYou can now change the owner of a\u00a0card page as long as you are already the owner or have an \"Admin\" security role.\n\n\n For more information about changing the owner of a page, see\n\nManaging Pages\n\n.\n\n##\n Ability to rename pages\n\nYou can now rename card pages inline instead of having to\u00a0make the change in the\n **Manage Pages**\n dialog.\n\n\n For more information about renaming a page, see\n\nManaging Pages\n\n.\n\n##\n Notebook card non-owner editing\n\nNotebook cards can now be edited by any Admin, Privileged, or Editor user with access to the card.\n\n\n For more information about notebook cards, see\n\nNotebook Cards\n\n.\n\n##\n Country maps for Portugal and United Arab Emirates\n\nYou can now add map cards for Portugal and United Arab Emirates.\n\n#####\n Portugal\n\n\n######\n United Arab Emirates\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCountry Map\n\n.\n\n##\n Regression lines\n\nYou can now add regression lines to single-series Vertical Bar and Line charts and most Line chart subtypes.

This will reduce the vulnerability of malicious attacks using cross site scripting and other methods. Domo will only allow tags in tables that are part of our \"whitelist group.\" In addition, only approved style attributes will be allowed.\n\n##\n Release guides\n\nAdmin users in Domo\u00a0will now have access to\u00a0release guides that describe all of the features for\u00a0an upcoming product release. These will be\u00a0accessible in an admin user's Domo one week before the release.\n\n\n Getting Help\n--------------\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by clicking\n **> Help Center**\n .\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://www.domo.com/university\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\ndojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo Or send an email to\n\nproduct.feedback@domo.com\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about getting help, see\n\nGetting Help\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360048116074\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004456\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNovember 2015 Release Notes\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,417\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "november_2015_release_notes", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "release_notes", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamwGAC"}, {"text": "archived_feature_release_notes", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan7GAC"}]}
