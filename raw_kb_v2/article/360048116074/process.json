The Data Warehouse\u00a0gives you\u00a0quick insight into the breadth of your data and also allows\u00a0you to drive into the depth of individual data providers. You can then\u00a0take\u00a0your newly gained insights and take effective action on a specific data source or create new data source where a gap was discovered.\n                       \n\n                        The\u00a0Data Warehouse\u00a0provides a three-dimensional visual representation of all data sources and Magic connectors in your Domo, along with data currently flowing into and between them.\u00a0These are represented as stacks on a rotating palette.\u00a0You can configure the order and height of the stacks to indicate different metrics.\n                       \n\n                        Data Warehouse main view\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Mousing over a stack causes the palette to\u00a0stop rotating, and an information panel appears for the data source or Magic connector. This panel shows information such as the number of DataSets for the data source or connector, the number of cards built, the number of successful and failed runs, etc.\n                       \n\n                        You can click and drag the panel to\u00a0move it manually. The panel can be\u00a0moved in three dimensions.\n                       \n\n                        Stacks are colored differently depending on their type and current activity. Green indicates a functional data source, blue indicates a Magic connector,\u00a0orange indicates a warning state for a data source, and red indicates that one or more DataSets\u00a0for a data source\u00a0is broken and needs immediate attention.\n                       \n\n                        The arrangement of stacks around the palette and the height of the individual stacks\u00a0indicate\u00a0specified metrics. By default, stack arrangement indicates status and stack height indicates the number of rows of data. If you want, you can change the criteria determined by arrangement and height.\u00a0For example, you could set the arrangement\u00a0of stacks around the palette to indicate the number of cards built using the\u00a0data\u00a0source or Magic connector\u00a0and the height of the stacks to indicate the number of DataSets.\n                       \n\n                        Clicking a connector stack\u00a0changes the view to show three-dimensional representations of all DataSets for the connector. This view also shows the data sources, the number of DataSets, and the number of rows for the data source or connector.\n                       \n\n                        Connector stack view for The Data Warehouse\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For information about The Data Warehouse, see\n                        \n                         Using The Data Warehouse to Manage Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Workbench 4\n                       \n\n                        Workbench\u00a0version 4 is here.\u00a0The latest version of Domo Workbench provides a clean and intuitive user experience that will help you get the most out of Workbench.
