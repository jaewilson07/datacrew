Denodo enables real-time access to integrated data across an organization's diverse data sources without the need for data replication. Domo's Denodo connector allows you to import any data from Denodo into Domo for in-depth analysis and visualization. To learn more about Denodo Platform, visit their website,\n\nDenodo Platform Overview.\n\n\n The Denodo connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from different data sources.\n\n\n You connect to your Denodo account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Denodo connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Pulling data files from Denodo into Domo.\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n The time taken to configure depends on the amount of data that is uploaded to Denodo.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Denodo account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* Denodo hostname you need to use to access\u00a0your Denodo account.\n* Denodo port number you need to use to access your Denodo account.\n* Denodo Database Name\n* Denodo username.\n* Denodo password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Denodo Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Denodo Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Credentials Pane\n-------------------\n\n\n The Domo Denodo connector uses Denodo Hostname, Denodo Port number, Denodo database name, Denodo username, and Denodo password to connect within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have an existing\u00a0Denodo account in Domo)\u00a0to open the Denodo login screen where you can enter the email address and password associated with your Denodo account. Once you have entered valid Denodo credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Box DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n This pane includes the following fields:\n\n\n|\n\n*Field**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the Denodo hostname. For example,\n ***myserver.domain.com***\n .\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the Denodo port number.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter the Denodo Database Name.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the Denodo Username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the Denodo password.\n  |\n\n\n Details Pane\n---------------\n\n\n This pane includes the following fields and menus:\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the report you want to run. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|\n Custom Query\n  |\n Enter the query to execute.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper\n  |\n Select a view and fields to auto-generate your query.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n User Query\n  |\n Enter Denodo VQL query to execute.\n  |\n|\n Fetch Size\n  |\n Enter the fetch-size for memory performance. If it is blank, the default value will be 1000.\n  |\n|\n Query Timeout\n  |\n Enter the query timeout value in minute(s). If it is blank, the default value set by Denodo will be 15 minutes.\n  |\n\nOther Panes\n-------------\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n####\n When can I use this connector?\n\nAllow real-time access to integrated data across an organization's diverse data sources without the need for data replication by using the connector.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n What is the default fetch-size for memory performance?\n\nThe default value is 1000.\n\n###\n What is the default query timeout value?\n\nThe default value set by Denodo is 15 minutes.\n\n###\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need to obtain the hostname, port number, database account, account username, and account password.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 000005123\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005123\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDenodo Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 1,548\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 2/13/2023, 5:54 AM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 2/13/2023, 5:54 AM\n\n\n"}, "title": "denodo_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
