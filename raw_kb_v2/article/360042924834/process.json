For example, you might have a period-over-period chart showing your earnings for the previous year side-by-side with the same measurements for earlier years. The following screenshot shows you how this might appear:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        In this example, earnings for the previous year are represented by a dark blue bar. Earnings for the three years before that are also represented as bars. All years are included in the legend so you can tell which is which.\n                       \n\n                        You can also include variance amounts in period-over-period charts. The following screenshot shows a similar chart as the one above, with a line for variance values:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        You build period-over-period charts in the Analyzer in Domo by selecting one of several special period-over-period chart types, applying columns for the x- and y-axes, then setting up your comparison in the date filter menu.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note:\n                            \n                            Drilling on period-over-period charts is not currently supported and because charts within a drill path are set to \"All Time\" by default, period-over-period charts cannot be selected within a drill path.
