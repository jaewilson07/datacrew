Avoid upstream policies and only apply PDP to the final DataSet View that is being published.\n2. Include both the input DataSets and the final DataSet View in the Publication.\n3. Use Magic ETL rather than Views to create the DataSets that you want to publish.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4434678124695\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004251\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPublishing DataSet Views\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,864\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:35 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "publishing_dataset_views", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "distributing_domo_content", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamqGAC"}, {"text": "domo_everywhere", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanbGAC"}]}
