In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0MailChimp account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0MailChimp connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing\u00a0DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n The MailChimp connector is appropriate for all of the following use cases:\n * Monitoring/assessing campaign effectiveness\n* Gathering feedback to create effective campaigns in the future\n* Understanding subscribers' normal behaviors and stats\n* Understanding target audiences\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Click rate\n* Open rate\n* Subscribes\n* Unsubscribes\n* Membership duration\n* Recipient count\n* Device open type\n* Recipient locations\n* Languages\n* Campaigns\n* Email subjects\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Content marketing roles\n* Direct marketing roles\n* Marketing analytics roles\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 10 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0MailChimp account and create a DataSet, you must have your MailChimp username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0MailChimp Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n\nCredentials\n\nand\n\nDetails\n\npanes in the\u00a0MailChimp Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0MailChimp connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo.
