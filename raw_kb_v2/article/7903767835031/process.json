You can create a Variable without using it in a Beast Mode, but you cannot use the Variable in a card or on a dashboard unless you use it in a Beast Mode.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Variables allow data analysts to interact with the data on cards and create dashboards that are fully functional apps, as well as effectively reducing content clutter. Variables provide low-code solutions for many use cases, including the following:\n                       \n\n\n                         What-if analysis\n                        \n\n                         KPI exploration\n                        \n\n                         Time comparison\n                        \n\n                         Score cards for product performance\n                        \n\n                         Guided analysis\n                        \n\n\n                        This article introduces Variables, default values, and controls; gives instructions on how to complete various tasks with Variables; and discusses Variables and governance.\n                       \n\n\n                         Variables - Terms to Know\n                        \n\n\n                        Variables have many uses and can show up in different ways around Domo.\n                       \n\n                        To help you learn about Variables, here is a short list of terms to know:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Term\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Definition\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Variable\n                           \n\n\n\n                            A value that functions inside of a Beast Mode.\n                           \n\n                            Similar to variables in math, Variables can be of different data types and various kinds, depending on controls.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Default value\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The default value of a Variable is set when the Variable is created.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Value\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The value of a Variable can change, depending on your modifications.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Control\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The way that you can interact with and modify the value of a Variable.\n                           \n\n                            There are three types of Variable controls:\n                            \n                             Default Controls\n                            \n                            ,\n                            \n                             Card Variable Controls\n                            \n                            , and\n                            \n                             Dashboard Variable Controls\n                            \n                            .\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        The rest of this article explains how to use Variables generally, but if you have a specific question about using Variables with your data, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM).\n                       \n\n                        Variables and the Beast Mode Editor\n                       \n\n                        Because Variables must be added to a Beast Mode to function, you can create them in the enhanced Beast Mode Editor.\n                       \n\n                        You can access the Beast Mode Editor from inside\n                        \n                         Analyzer\n                        \n                        by selecting the\n                        \n                         Beast Mode\n                        \n                        tile in the\n                        \n                         Visualize Tab\n                        \n                        , or by selecting\n                        \n                         Add Calculated Field\n                        \n                        from the left side rail in Analyzer.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Inside the Beast Mode Editor, you can view all Variables in your Domo instance by selecting the\n                        \n                         Variables\n                        \n                        tab.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Variables are organized by data type: Numbers, Strings, and Dates.

Controls allow you to update your Variable's value to find new insights, adjust selections, and update your cards dynamically on a dashboard or in card Details.\n                        \n\n\n\n                         If you are familiar with Domo, controls function with the same hierarchy as Quick Filters. In\n                         \n                          Analyzer\n                         \n                         , controls display in the same panel as Quick Filters, and that panel is labeled\n                         \n                          Controls\n                         \n                         , as a general term for both Variable controls and Quick Filters.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          If you aren't familiar with Quick Filters, what this means is that changes to a control on a dashboard override any changes to a particular control in Analyzer. The changes are only visible in the user's current location in Domo. For example, if you modify a control on a dashboard when you open the card in Analyzer, the control will have the same value as was last saved for it in Analyzer.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         Default Control\n                        \n\n\n\n                         The first type of control, a Default Control, is configured in the Beast Mode Editor. There are several kinds of Default Controls, such as dropdowns, pills, sliders, and textbox inputs. The kind of Default Control you can use with a Variable depends on the data type of the Variable.\n                        \n\n\n\n                         You can configure a Default Control when you create a Variable or come back later to add it by editing your Variable.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          If you change the default value for a Variable after creating the Default Control, the Default Control does not update automatically. To change the Default Control, you must make a change to it in the Beast Mode Editor and save the change.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          Default Control and Other Users\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         If you create a Variable without a Default Control and return to add one later, or if you initially configure the Variable with a Default Control and later update it, your changes do not override the different controls other users may have created or modified as they use your Variable in their cards and dashboards. This is not the same as for the default value\u2014if you change the default value for a Variable, every occurrence of that Variable in your instance reflects the change in the cards and dashboards of both you and other users.\n                        \n\n\n\n                         Another user can potentially adjust the Default Control for your Variable. If you then remove your Variable from a card or Beast Mode, when you try to add your Variable to another Beast Mode, the Variable's Default Control reflects the adjustments from the other user. You would need to go back to the Beast Mode Editor and adjust the Default Control to the original value if you want the your Variable's Default Control to have the original value.

This prevents creators from having to duplicate the same Variable across multiple DataSets. Variables are created in the Beast Mode Editor and all users in the instance can view them there.\n                        \n\n\n                         What permissions do I need to create a Variable?\n                        \n\n                        You need the Edit Variables grant.
