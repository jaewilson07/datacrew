You can easily create and manage custom, team-focused, and project-focused documents for collaboration. Use Domo\u2019s Microsoft SharePoint Online Writeback connector to export your data from a Domo dataset to your SharePoint Online.\u00a0To learn more about the SharePoint API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj860569.aspx\n\n).\n\n\n You configure your Domo-Sharepoint connection\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Sharepoint Online\u00a0Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you must have the following:\n\n An installed Microsoft Azure app.\n* The\n\nSecret ID and Value associated with your Microsoft Azure app.\n* The Tenant ID for your Azure app. This is generated when you create your Azure app.\n\n\n#####\n****To obtain the Azure App Client ID****\n :\n\n1. Go to\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n\n\n 2. Select\n ****Azure Active Directory > App registrations****\n .\n\n\n 3. Find and click on your web app.\n\n\n 4. The \"application\" ID is your Client ID.\n\n####\n****To obtain a new\u00a0Azure App\u00a0Client secret****\n :\n\n\n1. Go to\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n2.

Navigate to\n ****Azure Active Directory >> Properties****\n .\n3. Copy the\n ****Directory ID****\n . The directory ID is your\n ****Tenant ID****\n .\n\n\n###\n Creating an Azure App\u00a0for Enterprise OAuth\n\nTo create a Microsoft Azure app, do the following:\n\n\n 1.

Specify the client secret description and the expiry period for your client secret, and click\n **Add**\n .\n\n*Important:**\n Ensure to copy the client secret Value (not the Secret ID) before leaving the page.
