Domo provides connectors that allow you to pull data from a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection and compile custom reports.\n\n The MongoDB connector\u00a0uses Java driver version 3.2.1,\u00a0and\u00a0supports Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB connector.\n* The MongoDB Advanced connector uses Java driver version 3.2.1, and\u00a0supports a plain JSON query. You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB\u00a0Advanced connector.\n* The MongoDB V2 connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB V2 connector. Also, MongoDB V2 connector doesn\u2019t require a CA certificate.\n* The\u00a0MongoDB SSH Connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports\u00a0Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB SSH connector. You need your SSH credentials (host, port, username, and password)\u00a0to pull data from a MongoDB collection\u00a0through an SSH tunnel.\n\nThis article discusses the\n **MongoDB\u00a0SSH Connector**\n . You can use Domo's\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0SSH connector to pull data from\u00a0a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection through an SSH tunnel and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting JSON query filter. For more information about the\u00a0MongoDB API, go to\n\nhttp://api.mongodb.org/\n\n.\n\n\n The MongoDB\u00a0SSH\u00a0Connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n ****Database****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0SSH Connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Important:**\n An SSL connection is required for this connector to work.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your MongoDB\u00a0SSH account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into\u00a0SSH Host\n* The SSH host you wish to tunnel through\n* The port number of your SSH host\n* The SSH private key or SSH password\n* The username and password you use to log into your\u00a0MongoDB database\n* The host name for the database server (e.g.\n\ndb.company.com\n\n).\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n\nBefore you can connect to a MongoDB\u00a0database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n**Note: Domo does not support the SSH keys generated using ssh-keygen. The SSH keys need to be the DES or RSA keys (in PEM format) generated by OpenSSL.**\n\n\n Connecting to Your MongoDB\u00a0Collection\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nMongoDB\u00a0SSH\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to\u00a0a collection within a MongoDB\u00a0database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n SSH\u00a0Host\n  |\n The SSH host you wish to tunnel through. For example,\n\ndmz.mydomain.com\n  |\n|\n SSH Port\n  |\n The port number of your SSH host\n  |\n|\n SSH Username\n  |\n The username you use to log into\u00a0SSH Host\n  |\n|\n SSH Password\n  |\n The password you use to log into\u00a0SSH Host\n  |\n|\n SSH Private Key\n  |\n The SSH private key or SSH password\n  |\n|\n MongoDB Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the MongoDB\u00a0database. For example-\n\ndb.company.com\n  |\n|\n MongoDB Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the MongoDB\u00a0database\n  |\n|\n MongoDB Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0database\n  |\n|\n MongoDB Username\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0username\n  |\n|\n MongoDB Password\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0password\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\n\nMongoDB\u00a0SSH\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nMongoDB\u00a0SSH\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create a JSON query to pull data from your MongoDB collection. You can also create optional\u00a0WHERE,\u00a0SELECT,\u00a0GROUP, and\u00a0SORT\u00a0clauses, and apply the query filter to find documents in the collection, also in JSON format.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n How would you like to select your collection name?\n  |\n Select how would you like to get the collection name\u00a0(whether by entering it manually or selecting it from a drop down.)\n  |\n|\n Query Method\n  |\n Select a query method to pull data from your MongoDB collection.\n  |\n|\n Find\n  |\n A JSON Query will execute by 'Find Method'.\n  |\n|\n Aggregate\n  |\n A JSON Query will execute by 'Aggregate Method'.\n  |\n|\n JSON Query Filter\n  |\n Enter the query filter to find documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Limit Row\n  |\n Enter the number of rows you want to be returned.\n  |\n|\n Batch Size\n  |\n Batch size is the number of documents to be returned per batch which is used internally by the connector. Enter the batch size greater than 1.\n  |\n|\n Query Type\n  |\n Select which query filter to be used to aggregate documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Enter Query Filter\n  |\n Select \"Enter Query Filter\" to manually enter the JSON\u00a0Aggregate Query Filter.\n  |\n|\n JSON\u00a0Aggregate Query Filter\n  |\n Enter the query filter to aggregate documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Custom Query Clause\n  |\n Select \"Custom Query Clause\" to aply the custom clauses such as\u00a0where\u00a0clause,\u00a0select\u00a0clause,\u00a0group\u00a0clause, and\u00a0sort\u00a0clause.\n  |\n|\n Where Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0WHERE\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Select Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0SELECT\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Group Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0GROUP\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Sort Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0SORT\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360052376053\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003877\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMongoDB SSH Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,823\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mongodb_ssh_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
