To learn more about\u00a0the\u00a0PagerDuty API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://developer.pagerduty.com/documentation/rest\n\n).\n\n\n Ben Green\n\nSep 29, 2016, 12:59 PM\n\nThe PagerDuty connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This is the advanced version of the PagerDuty connector, which allows you to set up a date range for your report data. There is also a simplified version, which instead gives you the simpler option of pulling data for a previous month. For more information about this version, see\n\nPagerDuty Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account and create a PagerDuty Advanced DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The API key for your\u00a0PagerDuty account. For information about generating a PagerDuty API key, see\n\nhttps://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202829310-Generating-an-API-Key\n\n.\n* The domain for your PagerDuty URL. For example, if your PagerDuty URL was\n `domo.pagerduty.com`\n , you would enter\n `domo`\n as the domain.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0PagerDuty Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0Advanced Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the\u00a0API Key\u00a0for your\u00a0PagerDuty account.\n  |\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the domain for your PagerDuty URL.\n  |\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0PagerDuty credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0Advanced DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary\u00a0menu from which you can select a report, along with various other fields and menus that may or may not appear depending on your selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0PagerDuty report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Alerts\n  |\n Retrieves existing alerts for a given time range.\n  |\n|\n Alerts Rollup\n  |\n Retrieves existing alerts by day, week, or month for a given period of time.\n  |\n|\n Escalation Policies\n  |\n Retrieves all existing escalation policies.\n  |\n|\n Escalation Policies On Call\n  |\n Retrieves all existing escalation policies with currently on-call users.\n  |\n|\n Escalation Rules\n  |\n Retrieves\u00a0rules for a specified\u00a0escalation policy.\n  |\n|\n Incident Notes\n  |\n Retrieves\u00a0existing notes for a specified incident.\n  |\n|\n Incidents\n  |\n Retrieves existing incidents.\n  |\n|\n Incidents Count\n  |\n Retrieves the count of the number of incidents matching the specified criteria.\n  |\n|\n Incidents Rollup\n  |\n Retrieves existing incidents\u00a0by day, week, or month for a given period of time.\n  |\n|\n Log Entries\n  |\n Retrieves all incident log entries across the entire account.\n  |\n|\n Maintenance Windows\n  |\n Retrieves existing maintenance windows.\n  |\n|\n Schedule Overrides\n  |\n Retrieves overrides for a given time range.\n  |\n|\n Schedules\n  |\n Retrieves existing on-call schedules.\n  |\n|\n Services\n  |\n Retrieves existing services.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Retrieves existing users.\n  |\n|\n Users on Call\n  |\n Retrieves existing on-call users.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date.
