 Google+ is a social network and social layer for Google services. Use Domo's Google+ connector to retrieve data about activity streams, comments, and people. To learn more about the Google+ API, visit their page (

https://developers.google.com/+/api/

).


 This Advanced version of the Google+ connector provides more reports than the simplified version as well as more advanced configuration options. It also lets you pull more than 30 days worth of data. To learn more about the simplified version, see

Google+ Connector

.


 The Google+ Advanced connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Google+ Advanced account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google+ Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to a Google+ account and create a DataSet, you must have the password for the account you want to connect to.


 Connecting to Your Google+ Account
------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Google+ Advanced Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Google+ Advanced connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Google accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can select the account you want to connect to. After selecting an account, you are asked for the password for that account. Once you have entered a valid password, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google+ DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the currently active Google account.

 Troubleshooting
-----------------

If you run into problems, check credentials and permissions.


 FAQs
------


####
 How do I know my Google+ credentials are secure?

The connector uses OAuth, which authenticates the account with Google without Domo ever having to access your Google account credentials.

###
 Do I need a certain kind of account?

Any Google account that has Google+ enabled can be used.

###
 How frequently will my data update?

Changes to your data are available almost immediately; however, it is recommend you run your DataSets every 24 hours.

###
 Where do I get an Activity ID for the "Activity Details" report?

The Activity ID can be found by running the "List of Activities" report and copying the value found in the "ID" column.

###
 Where do I get a Comment ID for the "Comment Details" report?

The Comment ID can be found by running the "List of Comments" report and copying the value found in the "ID" column.

###
 Why does the "In Your Circles Count" report say I have 0 people in my circles?

Google disabled this report on its side. It is still available in the connector to keep existing reports from breaking.

###
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

Google allows roughly 5 queries per second per user. Note that a single DataSet run may require multiple queries.
