We regularly review our connector offerings and make enhancements to provide a more robust experience for our customers.\n\n\n Zoho recently announced that they will be deprecating their older API version 1.0 on December 31, 2018. Starting January 1, 2019, they will only be supporting API version 2.0. To account for this change we have updated the Zoho connector to API version 2.0 on October 30, 2018. The connector version is now 2.90, released on October 30th.\n\n\n**When is this change happening?**\n\n\n As Zoho indicated\n\nhere\n\n, API version 1.0 will be deprecated on December 31, 2018.\n\n\n**How does this impact me?**\n\n\n All reports running against API version 1.0 will no longer update after December 31, 2018.\n\n\n**What do I have to do?**\n\n\n To minimize disruption, make sure that you re-create all of your DataSets that were created before October 30th, 2018.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nZoho CRM is a customer relationship management application with features like procurement, inventory, and some accounting functions from the realm of ERP.\n\nTo learn more about the Zoho CRM API, visit their page (\n\n\n https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/api/api-methods.html\n\n\n ).\n\nThe Zoho CRM connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your Zoho CRM account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Zoho CRM connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector lets you track your sales pipeline, categorize leads, manage inventory, and keep on top of sales procurement.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Number of prospects\n* Number of new customers\n* Number of retained customers\n* Close rate\n* Renewal rate\n* Sales calls made\n* Sales calls per opportunity\n* Sales stage duration\n* Sales cycle duration\n* Proposals given\n* Customer lifetime value\n* Upsell ratio\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Sales\n* Marketing\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n some stuff\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n some stuff\n  |\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Zoho CRM account and create a DataSet, you must have the client ID and client secret associated with your Zoho CRM account.\n\n\n####\n\nTo obtain your client id and client secret:\n\n\n1. First, log into your\n\nZoho CRM\n\naccount.\n2. Visit the Zoho API Console and click the\n **Get Started**\n button.\n3. Select the Client Type.\n4.

If any data is missing for any reason, then most likely the credentials being used for the connector have fewer permissions than expected. Either enter credentials with full Zoho CRM system access or, through Zoho CRM, provide the account linked to Domo with the proper access.\n\n\n API Limits\n------------\n\nFree Edition\n\n 1000 requests/day/organization\n\nStandard Edition\n\n Min - 2000 requests/day/organization\n* Max - 5000 requests/day/organization or 250 requests /user license whichever is lower\n\nProfessional Edition\n\n Min - 3000 requests/day/organization\n* Max - 10000 requests/day/organization or 250 requests /user license whichever is lower\n\nEnterprise Edition\n\n Min - 4000 requests/day/organization\n* Max - 25000 requests/day/organization or 500 requests /user license whichever is lower\n\nZoho CRM will notify CRM administrators (Users with \"Administrator\" profile) if your organization exceeds the API limit. They also provide API statistics for better assessment of your integration requirements.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042929714\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003479\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nZoho CRM Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,006\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "zoho_crm_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
