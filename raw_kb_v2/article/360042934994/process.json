With DataSet sharing, you can even share your DataSet with groups, making it easy to handle your changing and growing organization. Whether people come or go, the right people can always have the right access to the right DataSets. And when you share a DataSet, you can even choose what level of access you want to grant. You can choose from the following access levels:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Co-Owner\n                          \n                          .

With Domo now available in six\u00a0languages, new and existing users can easily work within Domo in the language that they feel the most comfortable. With this feature, managers and team leaders can improve their teams' overall operational efficiency and get even more value out of using Domo. The Domo platform is prepared to scale to any number of languages to support Domo's steady international expansion.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        To turn on Spanish, go into your User Locale Settings by mousing over your profile photo and clicking the globe\u00a0icon in the top right corner.

We are excited to introduce the Sunburst graph.\u00a0This chart type is ideal for showing hierarchical relationships for DataSet columns. Each hierarchical level is represented as a ring. The innermost ring represents the top level of the hierarchy, and each progressive ring outward from the center represents a level down from the top level, with smaller segments representing a portion of their parent in the hierarchy. The relative size of any segment represents the value of\u00a0that segment. You can include up to 5 rings in any Sunburst graph.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For information about building a Sunburst graph, see\n                        \n                         Sunburst Graph\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Apple TV App\n                       \n\n                        Domo can be consumed and viewed across all platforms:\u00a0mobile, desktop web, and now on TV. The Domo Apple TV app is the ideal\u00a0offering for Domo users\u00a0who have large gathering areas, meeting rooms or operations centers, allowing them to have a constant realtime view into their business.\u00a0The Domo Apple TV app displays any card on a page with the option to have a running slideshow or just a single card view.\n                       \n\n                        You can download the Domo Apple TV app for free in the Apple TV\u00a0App Store (4th generation or later). Once you have downloaded the app, launch it and scan the QR code with your device, then log into Domo.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        New DomoStats Apps\n                       \n\n                        Domo is excited to announce two new DomoStats\u00a0Apps this release:\n                       \n\n                        DomoStats DataSets and DataFlows App\n                       \n\n                        With the new DataSets and DataFlows DataSet and App, ensure that your data is always fresh and that your Domo only has the most relevant and up-to-date information. You can watch your DataSet and DataFlow success rates, be notified when DataSets fail to run, and see\u00a0which DataSets are orphaned, duplicated, or broken so you can clean out your Domo instance. Never feel in the dark about your data again.

With the User Roles card, you can keep your instance secure and make sure everyone is working at the level that is best for them. To get an even broader view of your Domo data, you can also use DataFlows to combine this DataSet with other DomoStats DataSets. See all the information you need about your users, all in one place.

These updates should be a great help to our users in Australia and other parts of the world who want more control over how their Australia data appears.\n                       \n\n\n                         Australia Postal Map\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Australia LGA Map\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about these new map types, see\n                        \n                         Country Map - Australia\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Ability to Send a Card Using iMessage\n                       \n\n                        The Domo iMessage extension brings the power of Domo and real time insights into iMessage conversations.

This property determines how many series in horizontal line-bar combination graphs appear as lines.\u00a0By default, the first series that appears in your legend for these chart types becomes a line, and all remaining series become bars. However, you can convert series from bars to lines by entering the desired number of lines here.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For more information about Line-Bar graph properties, see\n                        \n                         Properties for Bar Charts\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Mobile Preview Image for Domo Apps, Sumo Cards, and Formatted Notebook Cards\n                       \n\n                        We have added an improvement to mobile rendering of Domo Apps, Sumo cards and formatted Notebook cards. Beginning now, anytime you view any of these card types on your mobile Domo app, you will see the preview image of the actual content.\n                       \n\n                        Support Portal Update\n                       \n\n                        An update to our Support portal will ensure that all of our customers\u00a0receive \u201cupdate\u201d emails automatically anytime their case is updated by Support\u2014providing improved transparency and customer experience.\n                        \n\n\n                        Connector API Change Announcements\n                       \n\n                        Other items our users should know about are as follows.\n                       \n\n                        Amazon MWS\u00a0API Change\n                       \n\n\n                         What is the situation?\n                        \n\n\n                        To take full advantage of the Amazon MWS API, we have decided to deprecate the old Amazon MWS connector and proceed with a\u00a0new Amazon MWS connector.\n                       \n\n\n                         What do I need to do?\n                        \n\n\n                        Create your DataSets in the latest version of the Amazon MWS connector. Simply visit the AppStore and power up the new DataSets using the new connector. Amazon MWS API has strict API throttling, and the connector does everything possible to globally pace requests. However, we\u00a0recommend\u00a0spreading out DataSet runs throughout the entire day and night. This is especially true for the \"Orders\" suite of reports.\n                       \n\n                        Once you have created your DataSets in the new connector, you should stop importing new data in the old connector by turning off imports in the \"Schedule\" section of the old connector. Once the DataSet is completely migrated, ensure that all cards and ETL logic is powered from the new DataSet. Finally, you can delete the old DataSet.\n                        \n\n\n                         When do I need to have this done?\n                        \n\n\n                        To ensure continuous service, please ensure that all your DataSets are set up in the new connector by October 11th, 2018. On October 12th, we will be marking the version 0 connector and anything associated with it as legacy and it will stop importing new data.\n                       \n\n\n                         What if I have additional questions?\n                        \n\n                        As always, we welcome and appreciate your feedback.
