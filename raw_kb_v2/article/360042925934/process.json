Archived tasks and lists can be \"unarchived,\" or restored to their original locations. Archiving provides a way of \"cleaning up\" your project page by removing completed or deferred tasks or unnecessary lists while making it possible to view or retrieve those tasks or lists whenever you need to.\n\n\n You can only archive tasks and lists from projects you are assigned to, unless you have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"Manage All Projects and Tasks\" enabled. For more information about default security roles, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n\n**To archive a task,**\n\n.
