Rectangle colors vary depending on how a particular data point fits into the specified data ranges. Heat maps allow you to visualize relationships between data categories and draw attention to \"hot spots\" of activity and trends.\n                       \n\n                        Powering heat maps\n                       \n\n                        Heat maps require three data columns or rows from your data source. Two of these contain category data, and the other contains the values for each category pair. No series data is represented. Values for each category pair are represented in your map by varying shades of color, each of which corresponds to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet; however, you can also specify your own ranges in\n                        \n                         Chart Properties > Ranges\n                        \n                        .\u00a0Ranges\u00a0are represented by a legend, which is automatically included under the chart.\n                       \n\n                        For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your heat map.

You can customize up to nine ranges in a heat map.\n                       \n\n                        For example, the following screenshot shows a heat map with ranges and colors determined automatically by Domo:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The Card creator decides the Card would be easier to interpret if more colors were present. He also wants to set the ranges manually instead of using the automatically determined ranges. So he sets five\u00a0ranges, as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Range 1\u00a0\u2014 Minimum 1 and Maximum 20, with color set to blue\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Range 2 \u2014\u00a0Minimum 21 and Maximum 40, with color set to green\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Range 3\u00a0\u2014 Minimum 41 and Maximum 60, with color set to yellow\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Range 4\u00a0\u2014 Minimum 61 and Maximum 80, with color set to orange\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Range 5\u00a0\u2014 Minimum 81 and Maximum 100, with color set to red\n                         \n\n\n\n                        The resulting heat map appears as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                         To set custom ranges on a heat map,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Open the Analyzer\u00a0for the gauge.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          In\n                          \n                           Chart Properties\n                          \n                          , click\n                          \n                           Ranges\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Enter a minimum value in the\n                          \n                           Range 1\n                          \n\n                           Minimum Value\n                          \n                          field.\n                          \n                          This value is the minimum value for your first range.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Enter a maximum value in the\n                          \n                           Range 1\n                          \n\n                           Maximum Value\n                          \n                          field.\n                          \n                          This value is the maximum value for your first range.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click the menu next to\n                          \n                           Range 1 Color\n                          \n                          and select a color for the range.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Continue adding new ranges as desired.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042924634", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
