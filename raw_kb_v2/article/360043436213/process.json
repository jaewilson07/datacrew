You indicate the data you want by inputting an SQL query. For more information about the MySQL API, visit their website.

In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n                        \n                         Database\n                        \n                        in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your MySQL database in the Data Center.

The SSH keys need to be the DES or RSA keys (in PEM format) generated by OpenSSL.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating MySQL Accounts\n                       \n\n                        You can create MySQL accounts two ways:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          By using account management statements intended for creating accounts and establishing their privileges, such as\n                          \n                           CREATE USER\n                          \n                          and\n                          \n                           GRANT\n                          \n                          . These statements cause the server to make appropriate modifications to the underlying grant tables.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          By manipulating the MySQL grant tables directly with statements such as\n                          \n                           INSERT\n                          \n                          ,\n                          \n                           UPDATE\n                          \n                          , or\n                          \n                           DELETE.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        The preferred method is to use account management statements because they are more concise and less error-prone than manipulating the grant tables directly.\n                       \n\n                        Another option for creating accounts is to use the GUI tool MySQL Workbench. Also, several third-party programs offer capabilities for MySQL account administration, such as phpMyAdmin.\n                       \n\n                        Whitelisting\n                       \n\n                        Before you can connect to a\u00a0MySQL database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to.
