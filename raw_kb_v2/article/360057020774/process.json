Slack offers many IRC-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. Its workspaces allow you to organize communications by channels for group discussions and allows for private messages to share information, files, and more all in one place. Slack is the collaboration hub that brings the right people, information, and tools together to get work done.\u00a0Use Domo\u2019s Slack Connector to fetch the data about your remote teams\u2019 interactions to increase productivity, irrespective of the physical locations.\u00a0To learn more about the Slack\u00a0API, visit\n\nhttps://api.slack.com/apis\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Slack account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Slack connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Slack account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Workspace's Slack URL\n* Your Email address and password for your Slack Workspace URL\n\nConnecting to Your Slack Account\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Slack Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Slack connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Slack accounts in Domo) to open the Slack OAuth screen where you can enter your Slack credentials. Once you have entered valid Slack credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Slack DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Slack when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the current Slack account.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Slack report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Conversation Info\n  |\n Returns information about a conversation.\n  |\n|\n Conversation Members\n  |\n Returns a list of members of a conversation.\n  |\n|\n Conversations\n  |\n Returns a list of conversation channels in a Slack team.\n  |\n|\n Reactions\n  |\n Returns reactions made by a user.\n  |\n|\n Team Info\n  |\n Returns information about the current team.\n  |\n|\n Team Profile\n  |\n Returns a team's profile.\n  |\n|\n User Conversations\n  |\n Returns conversations the calling user may access.\n  |\n|\n User Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of all user groups for a team.\n  |\n|\n User Info\n  |\n Returns information about a user.\n  |\n|\n User Presence\n  |\n Returns\u00a0user presence information.\n  |\n|\n User Profile\n  |\n Returns a user's profile information.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Returns all users in a Slack team.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Conversation Channels\n  |\n Select the conversation channel to report on\n  |\n|\n Additional Data\n  |\n Select the sub-list to flatten.
