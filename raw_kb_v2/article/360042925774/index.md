You can see which users are currently online (logged in) in your Domo instance. This is shown in the
 **Discover**
 pane in Buzz, in the "Online Now" section.

Profile pictures for the 5 to 15 users you interact with the most appear here, but you can see a list of all online users by clicking
 **View All**
 .

In this list, a green dot indicates the user has been active in Domo within the last 10 minutes, whereas a yellow dot indicates they have been idle for the last 10 minutes.


 You can search for specific users in this list by entering their names into the
 **Search**
 field at the top of the pane.
