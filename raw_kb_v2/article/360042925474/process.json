With such a powerful tool in your hands, you may eventually find that you have more Beast Mode calculations in your instance than you can easily handle. Luckily, Beast Mode Manager is here to help you regain control, by keeping tabs on all your Beast Mode calculations and performing actions on them as necessary.\n                       \n\n                        In Beast Mode Manager, you can do\u00a0all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          See statistics on all Beast Mode calculations in your instance, such as the total number of calculations, the number saved to a DataSet, the number not being used, etc.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          View information for a specific calculation, such as the number of Cards using it, the DataSets and Cards where it is found, the last updated date, the owner, etc.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Edit the formula for any Beast Mode calculation.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Add new Beast Mode calculations.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Lock or unlock a calculation (singly or in bulk.)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Change the owner of a calculation (singly or in bulk.)\n                         \n\n\n                         Archive a calculation (singly or in bulk.)\n                        \n\n\n                          Send a Buzz message to the owner of a calculation.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Duplicate calculations to a specified DataSet.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        To perform bulk actions, you must either be an Admin or have a role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" and \"Manage DataSets\" grants enabled. For more information about roles and grants, see\n                        \n                         Managing Custom Roles\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Beast Mode Manager is available in the Data Center. This topic provides instructions for accomplishing most basic Beast Mode Manager actions. For information about the Beast Mode user interface, see\n                        \n                         Beast Mode Manager tab\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         Video - Beast Mode Manager\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Filtering the calculations list\n                       \n\n                        Beast Mode Manager provides a list of all of the calculations in your instance that you have access to. You can click on calculations in this list to see their details views or select them to perform bulk actions on them (if you are an Admin or have a role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" and \"Manage DataSets\" grants enabled). By default, the list includes all calculations in the instance, but you can filter it in a number of ways, including the following:\n                       \n\n\n                         Entering keywords for the names of the desired calculation(s) in the\n                         \n                          Search Beast Modes\n                         \n                         field at the top of the list. (This search\n                         \n                          only\n                         \n                         searches calculation names. It does not search owner names or other metadata.)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             Special characters are\n                             \n                              not\n                             \n                             supported in the search field (such as: ! # % etc.) Only letters and numbers are supported.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Clicking on the\n                         \n                         icon in the top right corner of the list, choosing the desired filter, then entering or selecting the criteria to filter on (if required).\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         You can combine filters from the menu\n                         \n                          if\n                         \n                         it makes sense to do so (for example, you could not apply\n                         \n                          Used in Card\n                         \n                         and\n                         \n                          Not used in Card\n                         \n                         together). You can also combine these filters with Dashboard filters (discussed in the next bullet). For example, you could click the\n                         \n                          Saved to DataSet\n                         \n                         filter in the dashboard to narrow your list to show only calculations saved to DataSets; if you then selected\n                         \n                          Locked\n                         \n                         in the filter menu, the list would be further narrowed to show only locked calculations.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Clicking on any of the dashboard filter cards on the right half of the screen (such as\n                         \n                          Total Beast Modes\n                         \n                         ,\n                         \n                          Owned by you\n                         \n                         ,\n                         \n                          Saved to DataSet\n                         \n                         , etc.). These can be combined with filters you have selected in the\n                         \n                         menu.\n                        \n\n\n                        Viewing Information for a Calculation\n                       \n\n                        You can open the details view\u00a0for any Beast Mode calculation by clicking on it in the calculations list on the left side of the screen. In the details view, you can see the Beast Mode formula;\u00a0the Card or DataSet the calculation is built on; metrics for the calculation such as the number of Cards using it, the total number of Card views, and the last update date; the data type and owner; the Cards using the calculation; and a preview of the calculated column together with the column(s) it is derived from. You can also take actions on the calculation, such as locking or unlocking it, changing the owner, or sending a Buzz message to the owner.\n                       \n\n                        To see all of the Cards that use a particular Beast Mode calculation, go into the details view for the calculation then click the\n                        \n                         Cards\n                        \n                        tab. This is an excellent way to find out which Cards will be affected if changes are made to this calculation.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Adding a Calculation\n                       \n\n                        In Beast Mode Manager, you can add a calculation to any DataSet you have access to. Note that calculations created in this way are tied to the\n                        \n                         DataSet\n                        \n                        , whereas calculations added in the\n                        \n                         Analyzer\n                        \n                        are tied to the\n                        \n                         Card\n                        \n                        . This distinction becomes important when sharing content with other Domo users in your instance. If you share a Card with a Beast Mode calculation tied to it, that calculation is shared as well. Similarly, if you share a DataSet\u00a0with a Beast Mode calculation tied to it, then that calculation is shared.\n                       \n\n\n                         To add a calculation to a DataSet,\n                        \n\n\n\n                         In Beast Mode Manager, click\n                         \n                          Add Beast Mode\n                         \n                         in the upper right corner of the screen.\n                         \n\n                         A dialog appears in which you can choose a DataSet.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         This dialog includes many options for locating your desired DataSet. In addition to being able to search by name, you can also apply various filters to your search. If you click the\n                         \n                         icon, a dialog appears with a number of selectable filters such as\n                         \n                          Owned by\n                         \n                         ,\n                         \n                          Created Date\n                         \n                         ,\n                         \n                          Tag\n                         \n                         , and so on. You can choose any of these filters then specify the criteria for the filter. For example, if you chose\n                         \n                          Tag\n                         \n                         , you would then be prompted to select the tag associated with your desired DataSet. You can also customize filters by applying operators. These differ between filters. Most filters include the\n                         \n                          Not\n                         \n                         operator so you can indicate that specified criteria are excluded from your filter. For example, you might build a filter in which the status is\n                         \n                          not\n                         \n                         disabled.
