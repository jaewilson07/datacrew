Best Practices
----------------

These reports can power cards individually, but oftentimes it is helpful to combine the reports using Magic ETL. This way you can look at things like your keyword ranks compared to your competitor ranks or evaluate the search volume of your top ranked keywords. For more information about Magic, see

---------------

To connect to your BrightEdge account and create a DataSet, you must have a BrightEdge username and password.

This connector has strict data limits. If it fails to retrieve data, reduce the time period to 90 days or less and try again. This also means that multiple pulls and appends might be needed.
