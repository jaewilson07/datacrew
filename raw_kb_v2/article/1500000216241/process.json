(\n\nhttp://www.netsuite.com/portal/products/business-intelligence.shtml\n\n)\n\n\n The NetSuite Suite Analytics Partition connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n ****Cloud App****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to NetSuite in the\u00a0Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0NetSuite\u00a0SuiteAnalytics Connect Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n This connector does not allow you to retrieve already created Saved Searches.\n\nIf you need to see the same results provided by these Save Search reports in Domo, you should create a new DataSet for each raw table involved in your end results and use Domo\u2019s ETL tools to combine these DataSets.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to NetSuite and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Access to the SuiteAnalytics API, which you or your company must have purchased already (you can check to see if you have access by opening NetSuite Help Center in your NetSuite instance)\n* Your NetSuite username and password\n* The name of your NetSuite Service Host\n* The number of your NetSuite Service Port\n* Your NetSuite DataSource\n* Your NetSuite Role ID\n* Your NetSuite Account ID\n\nYou can find instructions for configuring\n ****SuiteAnalytics Connect by opening Suite Analytics (Dashboards, Searches, & Reports) > SuiteAnalytics Connect > Introducing SuiteAnalytics\u00a0Connect > Getting Started****\n .\n\n\n Your Service Host, Service Port, DataSet, Role ID, and Account ID can be found in the \"SuiteAnalytics Connect: JDBC Driver Setup\" screen in NetSuite. Follow these instructions to access this screen:\n\n. Sign into Netsuite\u00a0at\n\nhttps://system.netsuite.com/pages/login.jsp\n\n.\n2. Click\n ****Set Up\u00a0SuiteAnalytics Connect****\n , which is located under\n ****Settings****\n in the bottom left corner of the screen.\n3. Click\n ****JDBC****\n .\n4. Click\n ****Default Configuration****\n .\n5. Copy all of the information into the required fields in Domo.\n\nConnecting to NetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connect\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the\u00a0NetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connect\u00a0Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Service Host\n  |\n Enter the name of your NetSuite Service Host. For more information, see \"\n\nPrerequisites\n\n,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Service Port\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite Service Port number. For more information, see \"\n\nPrerequisites\n\n,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Service Data Source\n  |\n Enter the name of your NetSuite Service Data Source.\u00a0For more information, see \"\n\nPrerequisites\n\n,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter\u00a0your NetSuite username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite password.\n  |\n|\n Role ID\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite Role ID number.\u00a0For more information, see \"\n\nPrerequisites\n\n,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Account ID\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite Account ID number.\u00a0For more information, see \"\n\nPrerequisites\n\n,\" above.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid NetSuite credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0NetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connect Partition DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to retrieve data from NetSuite database tables.\u00a0You can choose a specific database table and\u00a0partition column name. You can also specify the number of past days you want to get data for.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute. Example:\n\nselect DATE from employee\n  |\n|\n Table Name\n  |\n Select the database table.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that you want to get data for. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. Example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ********************************yyyy-MM-dd********************************\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date Format\n  |\n Enter the custom date format you wish to apply to your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* The API will not return data that the user does not have access to. Likewise, if a user has filtered settings, e.g. to only see Income Statement accounts and not Balance Sheet accounts, only the data with\u00a0permission will be\u00a0returned (so the user would not get balance sheet accounts in the DataSet.)\u00a0Data access is managed by a NetSuite Admin within a customer's organization.\n* You may not have access to all the available data in your NetSuite instance.\u00a0If you try to pull data\u00a0that you don\u2019t have access to, you will get an error or incomplete results. If this happens, you may have to talk to a NetSuite administrator to get access to the specific data.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500000216241\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003972\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNetSuite SuiteAnalytics Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,751\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "netsuite_suiteanalytics_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
