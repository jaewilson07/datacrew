It unifies all your fleet data in one easy-to-manage solution, including driver and vehicle details, incident detection, etc.\n\n\n With the Domo Silent Passenger Connector, you can receive reliable data about your divers and travel log details from any asset across your fleet, from vehicles and trailers to heavy equipment and generators.

To learn more about the Silent Passenger API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://api.silentpassenger.com/\n\n).\n\n\n The Silent Passenger\u00a0Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Silent Passenger account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Silent Passenger Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Silent Passenger\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password associated with your Silent Passenger\u00a0account.\n* The client ID for your Silent Passenger account.\n\nConnecting to Your Silent Passenger Account\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the Silent Passenger Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Silent Passenger\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Silent Passenger\u00a0account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Silent Passenger\u00a0account.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Silent Passenger client ID.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid Silent Passenger credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Silent Passenger DataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Silent Passenger report you want to run. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Driver details\n  |\n Retrieves all driver details\n  |\n|\n Driverlog details\n  |\n Retrieves driver log details\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Driver Detail Report\n  |\n Select the driver.\n  |\n|\n Date Selection\n  |\n Select the date format for your data.\n  |\n|\n Single Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Specific Date\n  |\n Select the specific date using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Relative Date\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for in the\n\n\n**Days Back**\n\n\n field.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4415872970647\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003210\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSilent Passenger Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,357\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "silent_passenger_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
