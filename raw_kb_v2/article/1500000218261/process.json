It acts like a Karaoke for the digital age. It\u00a0also has the standard features like direct messages and the option to \u201clike\u201d videos, that you would expect from a social network application.\u00a0Use Domo\u2019s TikTok Ads connector to get the most out of your TikTok data. To learn more about the TikTok API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-introduction/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your TikTok account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the TikTok Ads connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your TikTok account and create a TikTok Ads DataSet, you must have your TikTok\u00a0account credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to Your TikTok Account\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the TikTok Ads Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThe Domo TikTok Ads connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing TikTok accounts in Domo) to open the TikTok OAuth screen where you can enter your TikTok credentials. Once you have entered valid TikTok credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new TikTok\u00a0Ads\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into TikTok when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of that\u00a0TikTok account.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n*Note:**\n The following reports are deprecated because a new report/endpoint is created to retrieve the data they were used for:\n\n Ad Performance\n* Ad Group Performance\n* Advertiser Performance\n* Campaign Performance\n\nThe following reports replaced the above reports:\n\n Performance report\n* Ad Audience\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the TikTok\u00a0Ads report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Ads\n  |\n Returns a list of information related to the ad to be displayed.\n  |\n|\n Ad Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of ad groups.\n  |\n|\n Performance Report\n  |\n Returns a list of spending and performance data.\n  |\n|\n Campaigns\n  |\n Returns a list of campaigns.\n  |\n|\n Custom Audience List\n  |\n Returns a list of custom audiences.\n  |\n|\n Custom Audience Details\n  |\n Returns details of custom audiences.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Report Level\n  |\n Select which level of audience data to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n Advertisers Selection\n  |\n Select how you want to input the advertisers.\n  |\n|\n Ad Service Type\n  |\n Select the ad service type.\n  |\n|\n Data Level\n  |\n Select the data level.\n  |\n|\n Advertisers Selection\n  |\n Select how you want to input the advertisers.\n  |\n|\n Advertiser ID\n  |\n Select the Advertiser ID(s) for which the data is to be fetched.\n  |\n|\n Fields\n  |\n Select the fields to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n ID Dimension\n  |\n Select if you would like to group data by ID dimension.\n  |\n|\n Time Dimension\n  |\n Select whether daily or hourly data.\n  |\n|\n Metrics\n  |\n Select the metrics to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n Time Granularity\n  |\n Select whether to get daily or hourly data.\n  |\n|\n Dimensions\n  |\n Select the dimensional grouping according to which the data to be retrieved.\n  |\n|\n Date Selection\n  |\n Select the date format for your data.\n  |\n|\n Single Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Specific Date\n  |\n Select the specific date using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Relative Date\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for in the\n ****Days Back****\n field.
