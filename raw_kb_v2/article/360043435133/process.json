When creating a Wrike account connection in Domo, previously you were able to connect to all accounts in your system. Now, Wrike only allows for connection to a single account. For this reason, you will need to re-connect your Domo\u00a0Wrike account in order to use it for future Wrike API connections.\n                            \n\n\n                             Connector Changes\n                            \n\n                            In conjunction with the authentication changes, the current Wrike DataSets in your account are no longer compatible with their API. Domo\u00a0has created a new Wrike connector that works with the new API version. You will need to recreate your DataSets on the new Wrike connector, which is denoted with a \"beta\" banner. This can also be found by going to https://[yourinstance].\n                            \n                             domo.com/connectors/com.domo.connector.wrike4\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Intro\n                       \n\n                        Wrike, Inc. produces a\u00a0project management tool that gets distributed and co-located teams working together so that projects are completed faster to save time and money.\u00a0 To learn more about the Wrike API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         https://developers.wrike.com/\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your Wrike account in the Data Center.
