Toggl tracks time spent\u00a0on tasks and projects, either through an interactive task timer or manual entry.\u00a0 There is a free personal edition and a professional edition for team collaboration. You can use Domo's Toggl connector to extract project and workspace data from Toggl. For information about the Toggl API, see\n\nhttps://github.com/toggl/toggl\\_api\\_docs\n\n.\n\n\n The Toggl connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Toggl account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Toggl connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing\u00a0DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for retrieving data related to time tracking on projects and tasks.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Billable hours to clients\n* Hours against projects\n* Hours charged by employee\n* Hours to specific clients\n* Users assigned to a project\n* Specific user hours across projects\n* Summary results by user\n* User results to task level in detail reports\n* Hours charged to tasks\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Project manager\n* Individual consultant\n* HR manager\n* Client manager\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 3 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Toggl account and create a DataSet, you must have a Toggl API token. You can find the API token for your Toggl account in the\n **My Profile**\n section.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Toggl Account\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Toggl Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nIn this pane, you connect to\u00a0Toggl by entering your\u00a0Toggl API key in the\n **API Key**\n field. For information about obtaining an API key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have entered a valid\u00a0API token and connected to Toggl, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Toggl DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a menu in which you select a\u00a0Toggl report, along with other menus and fields that may or may not appear depending on the selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Toggl report type. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Clients\n  |\n Returns information about all clients.\n  |\n|\n All Time Entries\n  |\n Returns all time entries within a specified workspace and for a specified date.\n  |\n|\n All Workspaces\n  |\n Returns information about all workspaces.\n  |\n|\n Client Details\n  |\n Returns details on a specified client.\n  |\n|\n Client Projects\n  |\n Returns the projects for a specified client.\n  |\n|\n Current User Data\n  |\n Returns data for the current user.\n  |\n|\n Detailed Report\n  |\n Returns time entries based on specified fields.\n  |\n|\n Project Data\n  |\n Returns data for a specified project.\n  |\n|\n Project Tasks\n  |\n Returns the tasks for a specified\u00a0project.\n  |\n|\n Project Users\n  |\n Returns the users for a specified project.\n  |\n|\n Single Workspace\n  |\n Returns details about a specified workspace.\n  |\n|\n Summary Report\n  |\n Returns aggregated time entry data.\n  |\n|\n Weekly Report\n  |\n Returns aggregated duration or earnings data for the past 7 days,\u00a0grouped by users or projects.\n  |\n|\n Workspace Clients\n  |\n Returns the clients for a specified workspace.\n  |\n|\n Workspace Projects\n  |\n Returns the projects for a specified workspace.\n  |\n|\n Workspace Tags\n  |\n Returns tags\u00a0for a specified workspace.\n  |\n|\n Workspace Tasks (only for Pro Workspaces)\n  |\n Returns the tasks for\u00a0a specified workspace.\n  |\n|\n Workspace User Objects\n  |\n Returns the user objects for a specified workspace.\n  |\n|\n Workspace Users\n  |\n Returns all users for a specified workspace.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Calculation\n  |\n Select the desired calculation for\u00a0the report data.\n  |\n|\n Client Name\n  |\n Select the client you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Date From Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of days before the current date to use as the start date.\n\n\n For example, if you enter\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Date From Offset**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Date To Offset**\n and you set the DataSet to update daily, each day the report updates to show information for a 5-day range, starting 10 days ago and ending 5 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Date Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of days before the current date to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Date\u00a0To Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of days before the current date to use as the\u00a0end date.\n\n\n For example, if you enter\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Date From Offset**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Date To Offset**\n and you set the DataSet to update daily, each day the report updates to show information for a 5-day range, starting 10 days ago and ending 5 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a single date or a range of dates.\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Select whether the\u00a0end date for the report is a specific or relative date.\n\n\n Select\n **Specific**\n if you want to specify a specific\u00a0end date.
