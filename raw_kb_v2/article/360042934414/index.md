You can add selected card pages as company pages. This locks the order of the pages in the navigation bar as well as the order of cards and collections on the pages. You do this in
 **More >**
**Admin > Company settings > Company page settings**
 . If a company page has subpages, the subpages are also locked. Other users who can access the pages cannot reorder company pages or add, remove, or reorder cards in the pages, or move copied or duplicated cards to a company page.


 You can only add company pages if you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Company Settings" enabled. For more information about default security roles, see

Default Security Role Reference

. For more information about custom roles, see

Managing Custom Roles

.

icon appears after the title in company pages and subpages.

 You can also lock the content in a personal (non-company) page by clicking the

icon in that page. You do

 need to have an "Admin" security role to do this—any page owner can lock his or her own page. Locking a page in this way means other users cannot copy, move, remove, resize, or reposition cards in the page unless they have an "Admin" security role.
