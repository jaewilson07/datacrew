If you update an asset, you may need to update each card individually. You can find instructions for doing this below in\n\n\n Update an Asset\n\n\n .\n\n\n In some cases, you may need to connect a card to a different asset. A possible use case is moving from\u00a0a demo or custom version of an app to another version. This requires you to switch any cards to the correct asset.
