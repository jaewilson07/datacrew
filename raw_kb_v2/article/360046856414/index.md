Intro
-------

You can upload data from external data sources to Domo after specifying connection and data information as a job, which you can save and use again.


 The process for creating a DataSet job in Workbench 4 goes as follows:

. You specify basic settings for the job in the
 **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**
 , including the Domo server, the DataSet Job name and type, the method of data transport (such as Local File Provider, ODBC Connection Provider, etc.), and the data reader (data source) type (such as JIRA, Excel, etc.). This adds an entry for the DataSet Job to your
 **Accounts**
 pane. However, at this stage the DataSet Job is still not ready for execution.
2. You specify connection information for the data source in the
 **Transport Method**
 settings for the DataSet Job.
3. You specify additional settings for the data source in the
 **Data Source**
 settings for the DataSet Job. These settings differ between data source types. Some, such as replacement variables for queries, are optional, while others are required.
4. If desired, you can configure miscellaneous options for the job, such as transforms, notifications, excluded columns, etc.
