Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nYou can upload data from external\u00a0data sources\u00a0to Domo after specifying connection and data information as a job, which you can save and use again.\n\n\n The process for creating a DataSet job in Workbench 4 goes as follows:\n\n. You\u00a0specify\u00a0basic settings for the job in the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation\u00a0Wizard**\n , including the\u00a0Domo server, the\u00a0DataSet Job name and type, the method of data transport (such as Local File Provider, ODBC Connection Provider, etc.), and the data reader (data source) type (such as JIRA, Excel, etc.). This adds an entry for the DataSet Job to your\n **Accounts**\n pane. However, at this stage the DataSet Job is still not ready for execution.\n2. You\u00a0specify connection information for the data source in the\n **Transport Method**\n settings for the DataSet Job.\n3. You specify additional\u00a0settings for the data source in the\n **Data Source**\n settings for the DataSet Job. These\u00a0settings differ between data source types.\u00a0Some, such as replacement variables for queries, are optional, while others are required.\n4. If desired, you\u00a0can configure miscellaneous options for the job, such as transforms, notifications, excluded columns, etc.\n\nFor information about the controls and field settings in Workbench, see\n\nUnderstanding the Workbench 4 User Interface\n\n.\n\n*Training Videos\u00a0- Upload Files with Workbench 4**\n\nLearn how to upload both CSV and Excel files with Workbench 4.\n\n*Part 1 of 4**\n\n*Part 2 of 4**\n\n*Part 3 of 4**\n\n\n**Part 4 of 4**\n\n\n For specific information about all of the connector types available in Workbench 4, visit the following links:\n\n Connecting to Excel Data in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to CSV Data in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to JIRA Data in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to ODBC Data in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to an OLAP Cube in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to XML Data in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to QuickBooks Data in Workbench 4\n* Connecting to JSON Data in Workbench 4\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360046856414\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004788\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCreating a Job for Uploading Data Using Workbench 4\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 11,583\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "creating_a_job_for_uploading_data_using_workbench_4", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
