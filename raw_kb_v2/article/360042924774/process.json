A multi-value gauge displays the current value of your as DataSet\u00a0as a numeral, along with the\u00a0degree of change for the gauge data, whether positive or negative. You can aggregate the current value of the gauge using any of a variety of aggregation functions (sum, average, minimum or maximum value, etc.). You can also show the degree of change as a percentage or a value. In addition, a number of other customization options are available.\n\n\n This chart type is useful when you want to see a change in value quickly, without having to interpret bars, lines, etc. This gauge is similar to a\n\nsingle value gauge\n\n, which displays the current value without the degree of change indicator. Other gauge types in Domo include\n\nfilled gauges\n\n,\n\nprogress bar gauges\n\n,\n\nradial gauges\n\n,\n\nface gauges\n\n, and\n\ncomparative fill gauges\n\n.\n\n\n Powering multi-value gauges\n-----------------------------\n\nA multi-value gauge requires only one column or row of data in your DataSet, which should contain the values. You can also include an optional column for grouping your data. In most cases, this will be a date column; this way, your change value will reflect change in the data over time. Finally, you can apply a column of target values to the gauge by clicking the\n **Tooltips**\n icon at the top of the screen then dragging the desired column into the\n **Target Values**\n field that opens. Target values are not reflected in the gauge itself but may be referenced using certain chart properties, which are discussed later in this article.\n\n\n For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about aggregating data, see\n\nAggregating your data\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about\n **Chart Properties**\n , see\n\nChart Properties\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your multi-value gauge. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nKPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a multi-value gauge:\n\nCustomizing multi-value\u00a0gauges\n--------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a multi-value gauge by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . For information about all chart properties, see\n\nSetting Properties for Gauges\n\n.\n\nProperty\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n\nExample\n\n|\n|\n\nGeneral > Layout\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you one of a number of different layouts for the values in your gauge. (\n **Split Right**\n is the default.) At right, you can see an example of each layout.\n\n\n Note that for the\n **Domo Summary 1**\n and\n\n*Domo Summary 2**\n layouts, the date grain elements (e.g. \"by Day\") only appear if you turn them on using the\n **Date Grain Options > Show**\n option.\n\n|\n\n\n Domo Summary 1\n\nDomo Summary 2\n\n\n Horizontal\n\nSplit Right\n\nSplit\n\nSplit Left\n\nCenter Vertical\n\n|\n|\n\nGeneral > Sizing\n\n|\n\nLets you select a size option for gauge elements.\n **Scale to Fit**\n , the default option, fills the card space with the selected elements. All fixed size options sets elements to different sizes, relative to other elements. Fixes sizes allow for consistency between cards but do not check for overlapping text.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nGeneral > Vertical Alignment\n\n|\n\nLets you determine the vertical alignment for the elements within the gauge.\n **Middle**\n is the default.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nTitle Options > Text\n\n|\n\nLets you add a title to your gauge. The title text actually appears within the content area of the gauge (so it is separate from the card name). The title is incorporated into the layout you have selected in\n **General > Layout**\n . In the example, it is used with the\n **Center Vertical**\n layout.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nTitle Options > Color\n\n|\n\nLets you set the color for your title. You can choose colors from a color picker, enter a hexadecimal value, or change the opacity using a slider. This option is only available when text has been entered into the\n **Title Options > Text**\n field.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nTitle Options > Style\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you choose the style for your title. You can choose bold, italic, or bold with italic. This option is only available when text has been entered into the\n **Title Options > Text**\n field.\n\n\n In the example, the\n **Bold Italic**\n style is used.\n\n\n |\n\n|\n|\n\nTitle Options > Size\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you set the size of your title in relation to the other text in the gauge. A variety of sizes is available.\n **X-Small**\n is the default.\n\n\n In the example, the\n **X-Large**\n size is used.\n\n\n |\n\n|\n|\n\nValue Options > Hide\n\n|\n\nLets you hide the value of the gauge. This is useful when you\n *only*\n want your users to see the degree of change rather than a specific value.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nValue Options > Value\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you specify the value for the gauge. A variety of calculations are available for determining the value:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nLast Value\n\n|\n\nThe last value in the DataSet is used. This is the default option.\n\n|\n|\n\nFirst Value\n\n|\n\nThe first value in the chart is used.\n\n|\n|\n\nSum\n\n|\n\nThe total of all of the values in the chart is used.\n\n|\n|\n\nAverage\n\n|\n\nThe average of all of the values in the chart is used.\n\n|\n|\n\nMinimum\n\n|\n\nThe lowest value out of all values in the chart is used.\n\n|\n|\n\nMaximum\n\n|\n\nThe highest value out of all values in the chart is used.\n\n|\n|\n\nCount\n\n|\n\nThe number of individual values in the chart is used.\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nValue Options > Size\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you set the size of the gauge value\u00a0in relation to the other text in the gauge. A variety of sizes is available.\n **Medium**\n is the default.\n\n\n |\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nValue Options > Color\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you set the color for your gauge value. You can choose colors from a color picker, enter a hexadecimal value, or change the opacity using a slider.\n\n\n In the example, the value has been set to blue.\n\n\n |\n\n|\n|\n\nValue Options > Use Change Color\n\n|\n\nLets you dynamically match the color of the gauge value to that of the change value. If another color has been selected for the gauge value, it will be overridden by the change value color.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Hide\n\n|\n\nLets you hide the change value of the gauge. This is useful when you\n *only*\n want your users to see the specific value rather than the degree of change.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Value\n\n|\n\nLets you specify whether the degree of change in your chart is represented as a percentage (default) or a change in the specific value.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Data\n\n|\n\n\n Determines how the degree of change in the gauge is calculated. A variety of calculations are available for determining the degree of change:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nFirst and Last Values\n\n|\n\nThe difference between the first and last values in your DataSet is used. This is the default setting.\n\n|\n|\n\nLast 2 Values\n\n|\n\nThe difference between the last two values in your DataSet is used.\n\n|\n|\n\nLast and X Periods Ago\n\n|\n\nThe difference between the last value and the specified number of date grain periods as determined from your DataSet. For example, if your DataSet\u00a0was broken down by week, and you entered\n **3**\n in\u00a0the\n **Periods Ago**\n field, your change value would be the difference between the last value in the DataSet and the value for three weeks ago.\n\n|\n|\n\nLast Target Value and Last Value\n\n|\n\nThe difference between the last value in your\n **Gauge Values**\n column and the last value in your\n **Target Values**\n column. Note that the field for applying a target values column appears\u00a0only\u00a0when you click\n **Tooltips**\n in the toolbar at the top of Analyzer.\n\n|\n|\n\nPenultimate Target Value and Penultimate Value\n\n|\n\nThe difference between the second-to-last value in your\n **Gauge Values**\n column and the\u00a0second-to-last value in your\n **Target Values**\n column. Note that the field for applying a target values column appears\u00a0only\u00a0when you click\n **Tooltips**\n in the toolbar at the top of Analyzer.\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Periods Ago\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you specify the number of past date grain periods to use in your calculation when\n **Last and X Periods Ago**\n is selected in the\n **Change Value Options > Data**\n menu.\n\n\n For example, if your DataSet\u00a0was broken down by week, and you entered\n **3**\n in\u00a0the\n **Periods Ago**\n field, your change value would be the difference between the last value in the DataSet and the value for three weeks ago.\n\n\n |\n\n\u2014\n\n\n |\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Size\n\n|\n\nLets you set the size of the change\u00a0value\u00a0in relation to the other text in the gauge. A variety of sizes is available.\n **Small**\n is the default.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n\n |\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Hover Text\n\n|\n\nLets you specify the hover text that appears when a user mouses over the change value in the gauge. A variety of replacement macros is available. For more information, see\n\nFormatting Data Label and Hover Text in Your Chart\n\n.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n\n |\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Direction Indicator\n\n|\n\nSpecifies whether the symbol used to represent change in the change value is an arrow (default), a curved arrow, or a triangle. Examples of all three of these are shown at right.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Indicator Position\n\n|\n\nLets you specify whether the change indicator symbol next to your gauge's change value appears before the value (the default) or after (which is shown in the example at right).\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Color Indicator Only\n\n|\n\nWhen checked, only the indicator symbol will take on the color specified in\n **Change Value Options > Positive Color**\n or\n **Change Value Options > Negative Color**\n . The change value itself will appear dark gray.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Reverse Color Direction\n\n|\n\nWhen checked, positive values are shown using the color you have selected in the\n **Change Value Options > Negative Color**\n menu, and negative values are shown using the color you have selected in the\n **Change Value Options > Positive Color**\n menu. This is useful in scenarios where positive values are associated with negative sentiment (e.g. the number of bugs reported in a software application).\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Value Format\n\n|\n\nDetermines whether the general number format for your change value.\u00a0Options include\n **Number**\n (which includes no special formatting),\n **Currency**\n (in which a currency symbol is affixed), and\n **Percentage**\n (in which a percent symbol is affixed).\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n\n |\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Positive Color\n\n|\n\nLets you specify the color associated with positive change in your change value. You can choose colors from a color picker, enter a hexadecimal value, or change the opacity using a slider. The default color is green.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n\n |\n|\n\nChange Value Options > Negative Color\n\n|\n\nLets you specify the color associated with\u00a0negative\u00a0change in your change value. You can choose colors from a color picker, enter a hexadecimal value, or change the opacity using a slider. The default color is red.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n\n |\n|\n\nAdditional Text Options > Text\n\n|\n\nLets you specify additional text to appear under the regular content in the gauge. A variety of replacement macros is available for dynamically including calculations in the text. For example, in the screenshot at right, the gauge\u00a0shows the average stock price for the period in addition to the gauge value and change value.\u00a0For more information about macros, see\n\nFormatting Data Label and Hover Text in Your Chart\n\n.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nAdditional Text Options > Color\n\n|\n\nLets you specify the color used for additional text in the gauge. You can choose colors from a color picker, enter a hexadecimal value, or change the opacity using a slider. The default color is black. This option is only available if additional text has been added using the\n **Additional Text Options > Text**\n field.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nAdditional Text Options > Style\n\n|\n Lets you choose the style for your additional text. You can choose bold, italic, or bold with italic. This option is only available when text has been entered into the\n **Additional Text > Text**\n field.\n\n\n In the example, the\n **Bold Italic**\n style is used.\n  |  |\n|\n\nAdditional Text Options > Size\n\n|\n\nLets you set the size of the additional text in relation to the other text in the gauge. A variety of sizes is available. If you do not scale to fill the chart space, this will be a fixed size.\u00a0This option is only available when text has been entered into the\n **Additional Text > Text**\n field.\n\n|\n\n\u2014\n\n|\n|\n\nDate Grain Options > Show\n\n|\n\nDetermines whether to show the date grain (e.g. \"by Day\" for day-based DataSets) in multivalue gauges with the layout (\n **General > Layout**\n ) set to\n **Domo Summary 1**\n or\n **Domo Summary 2**\n .\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n\nDate Grain Options > Color\n\n|\n\n\n Lets you specify the color used for date grain elements in the gauge.
