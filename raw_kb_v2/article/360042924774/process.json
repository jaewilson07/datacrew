A multi-value gauge displays the current value of your as DataSet\u00a0as a numeral, along with the\u00a0degree of change for the gauge data, whether positive or negative. You can aggregate the current value of the gauge using any of a variety of aggregation functions (sum, average, minimum or maximum value, etc.). You can also show the degree of change as a percentage or a value. In addition, a number of other customization options are available.\n                       \n\n                        This chart type is useful when you want to see a change in value quickly, without having to interpret bars, lines, etc. This gauge is similar to a\n                        \n                         single value gauge\n                        \n                        , which displays the current value without the degree of change indicator. Other gauge types in Domo include\n                        \n                         filled gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         progress bar gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         radial gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         face gauges\n                        \n                        , and\n                        \n                         comparative fill gauges\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Powering multi-value gauges\n                       \n\n                        A multi-value gauge requires only one column or row of data in your DataSet, which should contain the values. You can also include an optional column for grouping your data. In most cases, this will be a date column; this way, your change value will reflect change in the data over time. Finally, you can apply a column of target values to the gauge by clicking the\n                        \n                         Tooltips\n                        \n                        icon at the top of the screen then dragging the desired column into the\n                        \n                         Target Values\n                        \n                        field that opens.
