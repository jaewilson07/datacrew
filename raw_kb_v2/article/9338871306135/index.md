Intro
-------

Sometimes you may want to create many jobs in Workbench that are mostly similar but have a few unique details. It can be time-consuming and tedious to create each job individually. With the job duplication option, you can duplicate a job, keeping most of the details the same, and update only the details that need to be changed: the job name and the schedule.

*Note:**
 You must duplicate jobs one by one; bulk duplication is not supported.

Duplicating a Job
-------------------

1. Open the latest version of Workbench. You can download it in the Appstore.


 The homepage displays.


 2. In the left navigation rail, select
 **DataSet Jobs**
 .


 The DataSet Jobs page displays.


 3. Right-click on the
 **Job Status**
 of the job you want to duplicate.


 The job options menu displays.


 4. Select
 **Duplicate**
 .


 A dialog displays, confirming that you want to duplicate the job and stating that you are required to create a unique job name and set a new schedule for the duplicated job.

*Important:**
 Duplicating a job strips away any encryption transforms on a job.

5. Select
 **Continue**
 or
 **Cancel**
 .

 If you select
 **Continue**
 , you are redirected to the
 **Duplicate Job**
 workflow.
* If you select
 **Cancel**
 , you return to the jobs page.

6. In the
 **Overview**
 tab of the Duplicate Job workflow, enter a name in the
 **Job Name**
 field. This same name displays in the
 **DataSet Name**
 field and is how the DataSet displays in Domo.

7. Confirm that the other details in the
 **Overview**
 tab are correct, and select
 **Create**
 .


 The
 **Configure**
 ,
 **Schedule**
 ,
 **Schema**
 , and
 **Notifications**
 tabs display.


 8. In the
 **Schedule**
 tab, set the schedule for the duplicated job.

9. Verify the details in the other tabs.


 10. Select

 .


 Your duplicated job runs according to the set schedule.
