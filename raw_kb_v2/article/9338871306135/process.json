It can be time-consuming and tedious to create each job individually. With the job duplication option, you can duplicate a job, keeping most of the details the same, and update only the details that need to be changed: the job name and the schedule.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           You must duplicate jobs one by one; bulk duplication is not supported.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Duplicating a Job\n                       \n\n                        1.
