It can be time-consuming and tedious to create each job individually. With the job duplication option, you can duplicate a job, keeping most of the details the same, and update only the details that need to be changed: the job name and the schedule.\n\n*Note:**\n You must duplicate jobs one by one; bulk duplication is not supported.\n\nDuplicating a Job\n-------------------\n\n1. Open the latest version of Workbench. You can download it in the Appstore.\n\n\n The homepage displays.\n\n\n 2. In the left navigation rail, select\n **DataSet Jobs**\n .\n\n\n The DataSet Jobs page displays.\n\n\n 3. Right-click on the\n **Job Status**\n of the job you want to duplicate.\n\n\n The job options menu displays.\n\n\n 4. Select\n **Duplicate**\n .\n\n\n A dialog displays, confirming that you want to duplicate the job and stating that you are required to create a unique job name and set a new schedule for the duplicated job.\n\n*Important:**\n Duplicating a job strips away any encryption transforms on a job.\n\n5. Select\n **Continue**\n or\n **Cancel**\n .\n\n If you select\n **Continue**\n , you are redirected to the\n **Duplicate Job**\n workflow.\n* If you select\n **Cancel**\n , you return to the jobs page.\n\n6. In the\n **Overview**\n tab of the Duplicate Job workflow, enter a name in the\n **Job Name**\n field. This same name displays in the\n **DataSet Name**\n field and is how the DataSet displays in Domo.\n\n7. Confirm that the other details in the\n **Overview**\n tab are correct, and select\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n The\n **Configure**\n ,\n **Schedule**\n ,\n **Schema**\n , and\n **Notifications**\n tabs display.\n\n\n 8. In the\n **Schedule**\n tab, set the schedule for the duplicated job.\n\n9. Verify the details in the other tabs.\n\n\n 10. Select\n\n*Save**\n .\n\n\n Your duplicated job runs according to the set schedule.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 9338871306135\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004973\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDuplicating a Job in Workbench 5.2\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,835\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 11/1/2022, 11:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 11/1/2022, 11:23 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "duplicating_a_job_in_workbench_52", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_52", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZdT7GAK"}]}
