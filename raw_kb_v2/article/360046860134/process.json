Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nYou can\u00a0create a\u00a0JSON\u00a0DataSet Job\u00a0in Workbench 4. When\u00a0you select\u00a0JSON\u00a0as your\u00a0Data Source\u00a0type, you can specify the data node with data you want to retrieve, the delimiter, and how you want the data to be flattened.\n\n\n**To create a\u00a0JSON DataSet Job\u00a0in Workbench 4,**\n\n. Click\n **Add New**\n in the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window.\n\n\n This opens the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**\n .\n2. (Conditional) If requested, select the desired Domo server.\u00a0(This screen only appears if you have more than one server set up in Workbench.)\n3. In the\n **DataSet Job Name**\n field, enter a name for the DataSet Job. This is the name of the\u00a0job as it appears in Workbench,\n *not*\n the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.\n4. In the\n **DataSet Name**\n field, enter the name of the DataSet. This is the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.\n5. Select the desired\u00a0update method in the\n **Update Method**\n menu:\n\n* Select\n\t **Replace DataSet**\n\t if you want the DataSet to be replaced entirely upon updating.\n\t* Select\n\t **Append to DataSet**\n\t if you want\u00a0new data to be added to the existing data set upon updating.\n6. In the\n **Transport Method**\n menu,\u00a0select\n **Local File Provider,**\n**External Process File Provider**\n , or\n **FTP/SFTP File Provider**\n .\n\n\n Descriptions for these transport methods are as follows:\n\n\n|\n Transport Method\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Local File Provider\n  |\n Lets you select a file from your machine or a network.\n  |\n|\n External Process File Provider\n  |\n Lets you\u00a0use\u00a0a\u00a0third-party application to pull data into Domo using a script.\n  |\n|\n FTP/SFTP File Provider\n  |\n Lets you retrieve a file via FTP, SFTP (SSH-FTP), or FTPS (FTP-SSL)\n  |\n7. Click\n **Next**\n .\n8. In the\n **Data Source**\n menu, select\n **JSON**\n .\n9. In the\n **DataSet Type**\n field, select\u00a0the type of DataSet in the dropdown or enter a custom name.\n\n\n The DataSet type you select\u00a0or enter here is reflected as\u00a0the connector type in Domo after you execute the job.\n\n*Tip:**\n It is recommended that you\u00a0select or enter\u00a0the DataSet type that tells users what data is being represented,\n *not*\n the data reader you are using to present the data. For example, you might be connecting to a JSON file that contains Twitter data.\u00a0In this case the best option would be to enter\u00a0\"Twitter\" rather than selecting\n **JSON**\n because the data you are representing in Domo is from Twitter.\n10. (Optional) Enter a description in the\n **DataSet Description**\n field.\n\n*Note:**\n You can change any of the settings you made in the above steps in the\n **Source**\n panel for the DataSet Job after you complete all of the steps in the Wizard\n *except*\n the transport method.\n11. Click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n A new\u00a0JSON DataSet Job is added to\u00a0the\u00a0list of jobs for the currently authenticated server in the\n **Accounts**\n pane.\n12. Under the\u00a0JSON DataSet Job that was just added to the jobs list, select\n **Source**\n .\n\n\n A panel opens\u00a0with options for configuring your file transport and\u00a0setting options for\u00a0your\u00a0JSON data source.\n13. (Conditional) Do one of the following:\n\n* If you selected\n\t **Local File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\t1. Click the ellipsis (...)\u00a0in the\n\t\t **File Path**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Select the desired\u00a0JSON file from\u00a0your machine or network.\n\t* If you selected\n\t **External Process File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\t1. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t\t **Program Executable**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Select the desired executable file from your machine or network.\n\t\t3. (Optional) Enter arguments in the\n\t\t **Arguments**\n\t\t field, if any.\n\t\t4. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t\t **Output File Path**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t5. Select the desired output file path on your machine or network.\n\n\n\t\t The file type for the output path\n\t\t *must*\n\t\t be JSON.\n\t* If you selected\n\t **FTP/**\n\t**SFTP File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\t1. Enter the server name in the\n\t\t **Server**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Enter the port number in the\n\t\t **Port**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t3. Enter your server credentials in the\n\t\t **Username**\n\t\t and\n\t\t **Password**\n\t\t fields.\n\t\t4. Select the desired protocol (\n\t\t **FTP**\n\t\t ,\n\t\t **SFTP**\n\t\t , or\n\t\t **FTPS**\n\t\t ).\n\t\t5. (Optional) If you have an SSL certificate (SFTP and FTPS only), configure the settings as necessary.\n\n\n\t\t For more information about these settings, see\n\n\t SFTP\u00a0File Provider\n\n\t .\n\t\t6. In the\n\t\t **Remote File**\n\t\t field, enter the filename for the field you want to import.\n14. Click\n **Validate Configuration**\n .\n15. In the\n **Data\u00a0Source**\n field, enter the data node where you want to begin pulling JSON data.\n\n\n This should be an array of\u00a0objects (for example,\n\nKey5\\_Key3\n\n).\n16. In the\n **Delimiter**\n field, enter the delimiter that should be inserted into the column name in flattened results.\n17. In the\n **Flattening Options**\n menu, select how you want the data to be flattened. Options are as follows:\n\n\n|\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n None\n  |\n Returns \u00a0the unflattened JSON string.\n  |\n|\n Deep\n  |\n Adds new rows for all nested objects.\n  |\n|\n Wide\n  |\n Adds new columns for all nested objects. Only one row is returned.\n  |\n\nYou are now ready to execute the DataSet Job, thereby creating a JSON\u00a0DataSet in Domo. However, there are many other actions you can take on the DataSet job before you send it to Domo. These include the following:\n\n Setting an update schedule for the job\n* Adding the job to a group of jobs with an advanced schedule set in Windows Task Scheduler\n* Configuring notifications to be sent when the job update succeeds or fails\n* Encrypting and decrypting Workbench data\n* Creating new columns using calculations\n* Setting a custom date format on a column\n* Replacing a value in a column\n* Combining DataSets\n* Applying filters to columns\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360046860134\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004779\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nConnecting to JSON Data in Workbench 4\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,690\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "connecting_to_json_data_in_workbench_4", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
