To learn more about the Brightcove API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://support.brightcove.com\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Brightcove account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Brightcove connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Brightcove account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A Brightcove client ID\n* A Brightcove client secret\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see\n\nhttps://support.brightcove.com/managing-api-authentication-credentials\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Brightcove Account\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Brightcove Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Brightcove account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Brightcove client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Brightcove client secret.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Brightcove credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Brightcove DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus for configuring your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Brightcove report you want to run.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Analytics\n  |\n The Analytics API allows you to obtain analytics data for your Video Cloud accounts directly.\n  |\n|\n Video by Player\n  |\n The report allows you to obtain video data for a particular player in your Video Cloud accounts directly.\n  |\n|\n View Events\n  |\n The report allows you to obtain view events for a Video Cloud account.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Account IDs\n  |\n Enter a comma-separated list of Video Cloud account IDs you want to retrieve information for.

For example, the query\n\nvideo==1234,5678;player=9876\n\nis interpreted as \"where video=1234 OR 5678 AND player=9876.\"\n\n\n Using the special\n\nwhere=video.q=={property}:{value}\n\nfilter, you can limit your report to a specific set of videos based on a variety of properties, including all of the following:\n * tags\n* reference\\_id\n* custom\\_fields (internal name)\n* {a\\_specific\\_custom\\_field}\n* published\\_at\n\n\n Examples:\n\nTags: video.q==tags:foo,bar\n\nCustom Fields: video.q==custom\\_fields.thefieldname:foo\n\nTags and custom Fields: video.q==tags:foo,bar+custom\\_fields.field2:fish\n\n|\n|\n Player\n  |\n Select the video player you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043435653\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003350\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBrightcove Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,378\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "brightcove_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
