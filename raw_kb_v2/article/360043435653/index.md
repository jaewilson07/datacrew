For example, if you had selected

device\_type

as dimensions, you could enter filters for both using a query like the following:


 video==123456789;device\_type==tablet

Commas are treated as logical

OR

s, and semicolons as logical

AND

s. For example, the query

video==1234,5678;player=9876

is interpreted as "where video=1234 OR 5678 AND player=9876."


 Using the special

where=video.q=={property}:{value}

filter, you can limit your report to a specific set of videos based on a variety of properties, including all of the following:
 * tags
* reference\_id
* custom\_fields (internal name)
* {a\_specific\_custom\_field}
* published\_at


 Examples:

Tags: video.q==tags:foo,bar

Custom Fields: video.q==custom\_fields.thefieldname:foo

Tags and custom Fields: video.q==tags:foo,bar+custom\_fields.field2:fish
