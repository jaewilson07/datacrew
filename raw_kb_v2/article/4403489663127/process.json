Or you would drag the slider bar until the values in the fields match the numbers you are looking for. The Minumum and Maximum value for the column will be displayed underneath the slider.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Aggregated Filters in the Card Details view\n                       \n\n\n                         Open the Details view for the Card.\n                        \n\n                         Click\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n\n                         A\n                         \n                          +\n                         \n                         button appears.\u00a0If PDP\u00a0policies are enabled on the DataSet\n                         \n                          and\n                         \n                         you have access to all the\u00a0rows, a button reading\u00a0Viewing All Data also\u00a0appears.\u00a0If you see this button, continue to the next step; otherwise, skip the next step.\n                        \n\n\n                          (Conditional) If you want to filter on all rows in the DataSet, ignore\u00a0Viewing All Data.
