Intro
-------

Humanity (formerly called ShiftPlanning) is an online workforce management and scheduling system designed to help users easily manage time clock, attendance, human resources and payroll. Use Domo's Humanity connector to retrieve data about schedules, employees, notifications, and so on. For more information about the Humanity API, visit their website. (

https://www.Humanity.com/api/

)


 The Humanity connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Humanity account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Humanity connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Humanity account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 A Humanity username and password.
* The API key for your Humanity account. You can find this by logging into your Humanity account and navigating to
 **Admin > Data API**
 .
