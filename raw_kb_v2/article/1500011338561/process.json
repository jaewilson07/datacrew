It provides access to read Twitter data, including user tweets, user mentioned tweets and many other Twitter entities, and returns data based on the provided Twitter user name.\u00a0Once your Twitter data is in Domo, you can use your data to measure your social media ROI with visualizations in intuitive dashboards and apps. Get the most out of your marketing budget by measuring your social media engagement during different time periods, detect cross-platform engagement trends, and better understand your target audience. You can also track your top posts across social media platforms, rate and filter your top posts, and identify other patterns to help you create engaging content. To learn more about the Twitter API, visit their site (\n\nhttps://dev.twitter.com/rest/public\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Twitter account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Twitter V2 connector user interface.
