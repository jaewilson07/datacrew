To learn more about the CallRail API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://apidocs.callrail.com/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your CallRail account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the CallRail connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your CallRail account and create a DataSet, you must have a CallRail API Key. To obtain an API key, do the following:\n\n. Log into your CallRail account.\n2. In the CallRail dashboard, select\n **My Account > Account**\n in the top right corner.\n3. Select\n **API Access**\n .\n4. Click\n **Add API Key**\n in the top right.\n\nYour CallRail API Key appears in the table.\n\n\n Connecting to Your CallRail Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the CallRail Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your CallRail account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the CallRail report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Conversations\n  |\n Returns all conversations, Conversation objects include the two most recent messages.\n  |\n|\n Calls\n  |\n Returns a list of all calls in the target account.\n  |\n|\n Companies\n  |\n Returns all companies associated with the target account.\n  |\n|\n Form Submissions\n  |\n Returns all form submissions associated with the target account.\n  |\n|\n Notifications\n  |\n Returns notifications within the target account.\n  |\n|\n Outbound Caller IDs\n  |\n Returns all outbound caller Id's within the target company.\n  |\n|\n Summarizing Call Data\n  |\n Returns summarized call data for an Agency or for a Company.\n  |\n|\n Summarizing Call Data by Time Series\n  |\n Returns aggregate call data for an account or company, grouped by date.\n  |\n|\n Summary Email Subscriptions\n  |\n Returns summary emails within the target account or company.\n  |\n|\n Tags\n  |\n Returns tags within the target account.\n  |\n|\n Trackers\n  |\n Returns all trackers associated with the target account.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Returns users within the target account.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Account ID\n  |\n Select the account you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Company ID\n  |\n Select the company you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n User ID\n  |\n Select the user you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Group By\n  |\n Select the category you want to group data in your report by (by campaign, by company, etc.).\n  |\n|\n Fields\n  |\n Select a field to aggregate data by in your \"Summarizing Call Data by Time Series\" report.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date.
