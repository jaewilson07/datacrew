This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the LinkedIn Ads connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your LinkedIn Ads account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you use to sign into LinkedIn\n* Your LinkedIn password\n* At least one LinkedIn Ads account with access to\n **Manage Ads**\n (otherwise you will not be able to retrieve report data)\n\nConnecting to Your LinkedIn Ads Account\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the LinkedIn Ads Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo LinkedIn Ads connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing LinkedIn Ads accounts in Domo) to open the LinkedIn\u00a0OAuth screen where you can enter your LinkedIn credentials. Once you have entered valid LinkedIn credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new LinkedIn Ads DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into LinkedIn when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of LinkedIn.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the LinkedIn Ads report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Ad Accounts\n  |\n Returns the list of Ad Accounts.\n  |\n|\n Ad Analytics\n  |\n Returns Ad Analytics insights on click intelligence numbers.\n  |\n|\n Ad Budget Pricing\n  |\n Returns key insights on pricing metrics based on targeting criteria.\n  |\n|\n Ad Campaigns\n  |\n Returns the list of Ad Campaigns.\n  |\n|\n Ad Campaign Groups\n  |\n Returns the list for all the Ad Campaign Groups.\n  |\n|\n Ad Conversion Tracking\n  |\n Returns conversion data for the selected accounts.\n  |\n|\n Ad Creatives\n  |\n Returns a list of Creatives within a given campaign.\n  |\n|\n Ad Forms\n  |\n Returns Ad Forms associated with an account.\n  |\n|\n Ad Form Question\n  |\n Returns Ad Forms questions associated with an account.\n  |\n|\n Ad Targeting Facets\n  |\n Returns Facets describing the demographic groups of members on the LinkedIn platform.\n  |\n|\n Ads Targeting Reach\n  |\n Returns the forecasting of the reach of your targeting criteria.\n  |\n|\n Posts\n  |\n Returns the organic and sponsored posts.\n  |\n|\n Targeting Options By Ad Targeting Facet\n  |\n Returns the information about Ad targeting facet.\n  |\n|\n Targeting Options By Similar Entities\n  |\n Returns similar available options within each type of targeting.\n  |\n|\n Targeting Options By Typeahead\n  |\n Returns similar options using typeahead capabilities.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Search by Status\n  |\n Select the Status for account details you want to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n Search by Types\n  |\n Select the account type you want to search for.\n  |\n|\n Reporting Facet\n  |\n Select the object type that will be reported on.\n  |\n|\n Account\n  |\n Select the account.\n  |\n|\n Pivot\n  |\n Select the object that each report data point will be grouped by.\n  |\n|\n Time Granularity\n  |\n Select the time granularity for the report.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Type\n  |\n Select the campaign type.\n  |\n|\n BID Type\n  |\n Select the BID type.\n  |\n|\n Match Type\n  |\n Select the match type.\n  |\n|\n Currency\n  |\n Select the currency.\n  |\n|\n Targeting Facets\n  |\n Select the Targeting Facets to include.\n  |\n|\n Campaigns\n  |\n Select the campaigns to include.\n  |\n|\n Filter by Campaign Status\n  |\n Select which status' to filter by.
