Intro
-------


 LinkedIn Ads is a self-service advertising product that allows advertisers to reach a targeted professional audience of their choosing.

To learn more about the LinkedIn Ads API, visit their page (

https://developer.linkedin.com/

).


 You connect to your LinkedIn Ads account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the LinkedIn Ads connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your LinkedIn Ads account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The email address you use to sign into LinkedIn
* Your LinkedIn password
* At least one LinkedIn Ads account with access to
 **Manage Ads**
 (otherwise you will not be able to retrieve report data)

Connecting to Your LinkedIn Ads Account
-----------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the LinkedIn Ads Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo LinkedIn Ads connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing LinkedIn Ads accounts in Domo) to open the LinkedIn OAuth screen where you can enter your LinkedIn credentials. Once you have entered valid LinkedIn credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new LinkedIn Ads DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into LinkedIn when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of LinkedIn.


###
