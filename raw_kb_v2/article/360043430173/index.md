You can add a document, image, or video to Domo to share with others.


 In Domo, the document, image, or video appears as a Doc Card. For many file types, the document, image, or video will be embedded right into the Doc Card, allowing users to view it without having to first download it. If you go to the Details view for that Doc Card, you can view a full-sized version of the document, image, or video. These embeddable file types include all of the following:

 DOC/DOCX
* PDF
* JPEG
* PNG
* PPT/PPTX
* MP4
* XLS/XLSX
* TXT
* BMP

For other permitted file types not in this list, a download button appears instead of an embedded view.


**Note:**

In the interest of preventing users from uploading malicious files into Domo accounts, Domo allows a specific set of file types to be uploaded. If you attempt to upload a file not within this list, an error message appears. For more information, see
