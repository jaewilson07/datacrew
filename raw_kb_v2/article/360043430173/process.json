For many file types, the document, image, or video will be embedded right into the Doc Card, allowing users to view it without having to first download it. If you go to the Details view for that Doc Card, you can view a full-sized version of the document, image, or video. These embeddable file types include all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          DOC/DOCX\n                         \n\n\n\n                          PDF\n                         \n\n\n\n                          JPEG\n                         \n\n\n\n                          PNG\n                         \n\n\n\n                          PPT/PPTX\n                         \n\n\n\n                          MP4\n                         \n\n\n\n                          XLS/XLSX\n                         \n\n\n\n                          TXT\n                         \n\n\n\n                          BMP\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For other permitted\u00a0file types\u00a0not in this list, a download button appears instead of an embedded view.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note:\n                            \n\n                           In the interest of preventing users from uploading malicious files into Domo accounts, Domo allows a specific set of file types to be uploaded.
