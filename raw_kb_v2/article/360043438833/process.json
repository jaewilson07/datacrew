You can use the YouTube Connector to connect your data with the app or upload your own data into Domo and connect it with the app.\n\nParts of the App\n------------------\n\nThe YouTube Viewer Demographic app is divided into sections so that you are able to easily view and navigate the metrics that matter. Note that the app displays up to 60 days of content.\n\n###\n Viewer Gender\n\nThe Viewer Gender section shows you the percentage of male and female viewers that are watching your content on YouTube.\n\n\n####\n Viewer Age % Breakdown\n\nThe Viewer Age % Breakdown section breaks down the age of your viewers into 6 sections: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. If you hover over individual portions of the filled-graph percentage for each age section will be displayed in the center of the graph.\n\n\n####\n Ratings\n\nThe Ratings section displays the number of total likes and dislikes using a comparison bar graph.\n\n\n####\n Geography\n\nThe Geography section displays where in the world your viewers are watching your content.
