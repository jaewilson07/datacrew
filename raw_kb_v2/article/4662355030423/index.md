You can use Scripting tiles to automate data processing and data science workflows. For an overview, see

 In this article, we’ll provide an overview of your container and how to upgrade it.


 Product and Container Options
-------------------------------

Today, we have three tiers of container options for Scripting tiles. Containers are resource graduations of CPU and memory levels. These are active at the instance level for DataFlows using Scripting tiles.

**Important:**
 These are the current product and container pairings as of February 2022.

Requesting Container Upgrades
-------------------------------

Customers that purchased Scripting Tiles for a Data Science use case before February 2022, may be eligible to request a container upgrade of max 32 Memory (Gib), 2 CPU for their instance. Scripting tiles before this time were provisioned with a container of 16 Memory (Gib), 1 CPU.


 The next container level of 2 CPU and 64 Memory (Gib) will require a formal product upgrade. Please speak to your Account Executive to explore that option.


 In order to request a container upgrade for your instance, please include the requirements below in your request to Domo Support.
