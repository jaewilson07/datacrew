For an overview, see\n\nNew Magic ETL Tiles: Scripting\n\n.\n\n\n In this article, we\u2019ll provide an overview of your container and how to upgrade it.\n\n\n Product and Container Options\n-------------------------------\n\nToday, we have three tiers of container options for Scripting tiles. Containers are resource graduations of CPU and memory levels. These are active at the instance level for DataFlows using Scripting tiles.\n\n **Product**  | **Use Case**  | **Container**  |\n|\n**Entry Scripting Tiles**\n\n\n*Python / R Tiles*\n |\n ETL operations (non-Data Science)\n  |\n 16 Memory (Gib), 1 CPU\n  |\n|\n**Data Science Tiles 1**\n\n\n*Python / R, Action Tiles*\n |\n Data science operations\n  |\n 32 Memory (Gib), 2 CPU\n  |\n|\n**Data Science Tiles 2**\n\n\n*Python / R, Action Tiles*\n |\n Data science operations \u2013 Memory intensive\n  |\n 64 Memory (Gib), 2 CPU\n  |\n\n\n**Important:**\n These are the current product and container pairings as of February 2022.\n\nRequesting Container Upgrades\n-------------------------------\n\nCustomers that purchased Scripting Tiles for a Data Science use case before February 2022, may be eligible to request a container upgrade of max 32 Memory (Gib), 2 CPU for their instance. Scripting tiles before this time were provisioned with a container of 16 Memory (Gib), 1 CPU.\n\n\n The next container level of 2 CPU and 64 Memory (Gib) will require a formal product upgrade. Please speak to your Account Executive to explore that option.\n\n\n In order to request a container upgrade for your instance, please include the requirements below in your request to Domo Support.\n\n Container needed (max 32 Memory (Gib), 2 CPU without formal upgrade through Account Executive.)\n* Description of your Data Science use case.\n\nIf you are considering a formal upgrade and want to run a test as part of your evaluation, you can request a DataFlow level upgrade from Support. Include the requirements below in your request:\n\n DataFlow ID\n* Container needed\n* Description of your use case\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4662355030423\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004578\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nRequesting Memory Upgrades\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,783\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "requesting_memory_upgrades", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "magic_etl", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanvGAC"}]}
