You can\u00a0easily and securely access your data\u00a0in minutes to get more visibility. Use Domo's MariaDB Partition Connector to get your data into Domo based on the number of past days provided.\u00a0To learn more about MariaDB, visit\n\nhttps://mariadb.com/docs/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your MariaDB data account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the MariaDB Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your MariaDB\u00a0database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your MariaDB account\n* The host name for the database\n* The port number for the database\n* The\u00a0database or schema name\n\nYou can also include the URL where your SSL CA Certificate is located, though this is optional.\n\n\n Before you can connect to a MariaDB\u00a0database, you must also white list a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your MariaDB Database\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the MariaDB Partition\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your MariaDB database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the hostname or IP address of your database server. Example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n|\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for your database.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter your database name.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your MariaDB username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your MariaDB password.\n  |\n|\n CA Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.\u00a0This is optional.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid MariaDB\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new MariaDB Partition DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database.\u00a0You can choose a specific database table and\u00a0partition column name. You can also specify the number of past days you want to get data for.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute. Example:\n\nselect DATE from employee\n  |\n|\n Table Name\n  |\n Select the database table.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that you want to get data for. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. Example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ****************yyyy-MM-dd****************\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date Format\n  |\n Enter the custom date format you wish to apply to your data.\n  |\n|\n Tinyint values treated as bit\u00a0(boolean) values\n  |\n Select Yes if you want the tiny integer\u00a0values to be treated as boolean\u00a0values, else select No.\n  |\n|\n Cast Boolean Values To...\n  |\n Select whether the String or Integer boolean values will be cast to within your dataset.\n\nString: False/True\n\nInteger: 0/1\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360057028694\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003963\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMariaDB Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,678\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mariadb_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
