Domo has updated the Dropbox for Business connectors so that our customers can leverage the new Dropbox v2 API. Due to changes in authentication and schema in the new API, we will be deprecating the 2.x version of the Domo\u00a0Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors. In addition, Domo plans to consolidate the two connectors into a single Dropbox for Business Advanced connector. In order to minimize the interruptions with your Dropbox data, please be aware of the following dates for these changes.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             May 31, 2019\n                            \n                            : The 2.x version of the Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be deprecated. Customers will still have access to all existing DataSets but will no longer be able to create new ones using the 2.x connectors. The updated 3.x version of the Dropbox for Business Advanced connector will be available for use on this date. In order to create new DataSets, customers will need to create a new Dropbox\u00a0for Business Advanced DataSet and enter\u00a0credentials there. Customers should begin migrating/re-creating existing Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced DataSets immediately to use the new 3.x Dropbox for Business Advanced connector.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             June 19, 2019\n                            \n                            : The 2.x versions of the Dropbox\u00a0for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be disabled DataSets created using these versions of the connectors will no longer function.
