Domo has updated the Dropbox for Business connectors so that our customers can leverage the new Dropbox v2 API. Due to changes in authentication and schema in the new API, we will be deprecating the 2.x version of the Domo\u00a0Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors. In addition, Domo plans to consolidate the two connectors into a single Dropbox for Business Advanced connector. In order to minimize the interruptions with your Dropbox data, please be aware of the following dates for these changes.\n\n\n**May 31, 2019**\n : The 2.x version of the Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be deprecated. Customers will still have access to all existing DataSets but will no longer be able to create new ones using the 2.x connectors. The updated 3.x version of the Dropbox for Business Advanced connector will be available for use on this date. In order to create new DataSets, customers will need to create a new Dropbox\u00a0for Business Advanced DataSet and enter\u00a0credentials there. Customers should begin migrating/re-creating existing Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced DataSets immediately to use the new 3.x Dropbox for Business Advanced connector.\n\n\n**June 19, 2019**\n : The 2.x versions of the Dropbox\u00a0for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be disabled DataSets created using these versions of the connectors will no longer function. Customers will need to have created new accounts and DataSets using the updated 3.x version of Dropbox for Business Advanced connector by this date.\n\n\n Intro\n-------\n\n\n Dropbox for Business is\u00a0a file sharing and storage solution that\u00a0allows\u00a0users to share, store, and sync files securely. You can use Domo's\u00a0Dropbox for Business Advanced connector to\u00a0compile reports about account information, team information, audit log, and team usage statistics. To learn more about the Dropbox for Business API, go to\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/developers/business\n\n.\n\n\n This connector is nearly identical to the standard Dropbox for Business connector but includes an additional report type, \"Groups Information,\"\u00a0and some configuration options. For information about the standard Dropbox for Business connector, see\n\nDropbox for Business Connector\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Dropbox for Business Advanced connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to get information about system usage and make governance decisions.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Storage usage\n* Membership\n* User activity\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Dropbox system administrator\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Dropbox account and create a Dropbox for Business Advanced connector DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The account you use to log into your Dropbox account.\n* The password you use to log into your Dropbox account.\n\nIf you don't have credentials you can get them here:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/business\n\n\n Connecting to your Dropbox account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Dropbox for Business Advanced connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n The Domo Dropbox for Business Advanced connector uses OAuth to connect to Dropbox for Business.

After you have entered valid Dropbox credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Dropbox for Business Advanced DataSet.\n\n\n You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n **Data Center**\n . For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane includes a\u00a0menu from which you select a report type, along with various configuration options.\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Dropbox for Business Advanced report.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nAudit Log\n\n|\n\nAccesses the Dropbox for Business audit log for a team.\n\n|\n|\n Groups Information\n  |\n Retrieves reporting data about your Dropbox for Business groups.\n  |\n|\n\nLinked Devices\n\n|\n\nRetrieves reporting data about a team's linked devices.\n\n|\n|\n\nMembers\n\n|\n\nLists members of a team.\n\n|\n|\n\nMembership\n\n|\n\nRetrieves reporting data about a team's membership.\n\n|\n|\n\nStorage usage\n\n|\n\nRetrieves reporting data about a team's storage usage.\n\n|\n|\n\nTeam Information\n\n|\n\nRetrieves information about a team.\n\n|\n|\n\nUser Activity\n\n|\n\nRetrieves reporting data about a team's user activity.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Enter the start date for the data you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Enter the end date for the data you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n User\n  |\n Enter the email ID of the user you want to pull information for.\n  |\n|\n Category Flag\n  |\n Select whether you want to filter your report data using a category.\n  |\n|\n Category\n  |\n Select the category you want to filter your data by.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n####\n How do I know my Dropbox credentials are secure?\n\nThe login process uses the OAuth process, so your Dropbox credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n Can I use the same account to create multiple DataSets?\n\nYes.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDataSets should be set to update no more than once every 15 minutes.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nWhile Dropbox may enforce call rate limits, you should not need to worry about them.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nCheck credentials and permissions against the error code received.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434813\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003434\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDropbox for Business Advanced Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,651\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "dropbox_for_business_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
