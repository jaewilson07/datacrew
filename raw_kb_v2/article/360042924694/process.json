These values are treated as coordinates; for every x and y value pair, a single point is plotted on the chart. This type of chart is similar to both\n                        \n                         category scatter charts\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         bubble charts\n                        \n                        . It is different from category scatter charts in that it includes two value scales rather than one value scale and one category scale, and it is different from bubble charts in that it requires only three columns instead of four.\n                       \n\n                        You can also build a scatter plot\u00a0time chart, in which you include timeline data instead of value data on the x-axis. In this case, all points are plotted on their appropriate date/time coordinates.\u00a0The position of a\u00a0point\u00a0for a given date/time\u00a0coordinate is still determined by its y coordinate value, however.\n                       \n\n\n                         Video - Building a Scatter Plot Chart\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Powering scatter plot charts\n                       \n\n                        A scatter plot chart requires two columns of data in your DataSet\u2014either two columns for value data or one with value data and one with date-time data.
