For example, if a Privileged user who owns a Page or Card is reassigned to the level of Participant user, he or she will still have access to that Card or Page. If on the other hand a Card or Page was merely shared with that user, they would no longer have access. It will essentially disappear from their view.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Grant Levels for Default Security Roles\n                       \n\n                        The following sections describes the level of grants for the default security roles.\n                       \n\n                        Admin\n                       \n\n                        Users\u00a0with this default security role have all grants.\n                       \n\n                        Privileged\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Grant\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Description\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                           Alerts\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                              Create, edit and share any Alerts to which you have access.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              View, edit, add, or delete Alert Actions on any Alert of which the user is owner.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Appstore\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                              Install and use Apps from the Appstore.
