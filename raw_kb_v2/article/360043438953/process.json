For information about features for controlling access, see\n\nControlling Access in Domo\n\n.\n\n\n Below are the various default security roles in Domo:\n\n\n**Admin**\n\n\n**Privileged**\n\n\n**Editor**\n\n\n**Participant**\n\n\n**Social**\n\n\n Each security role has a set of associated grants. Note that these are the\n *default*\n security roles available in Domo. (They are also known as \"Domo roles\"). You can also create custom security roles in\n **More >**\n**Admin > Governance > Roles**\n . This is discussed in detail in\n\nManaging Roles\n\n.\n\n\n If you have an \"Admin\" security role or a customized role with the \"Manage all roles\" privilege, you can manage grants and security roles of other users in Domo. For information about assigning security roles, see\n\nAssigning a Security Role to a User\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf a user's access level is changed, they may not be able to see certain assets anymore, depending on their ownership of those assets. For example, if a Privileged user who owns a Page or Card is reassigned to the level of Participant user, he or she will still have access to that Card or Page. If on the other hand a Card or Page was merely shared with that user, they would no longer have access. It will essentially disappear from their view.\n\nGrant Levels for Default Security Roles\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe following sections describes the level of grants for the default security roles.\n\n##\n Admin\n\nUsers\u00a0with this default security role have all grants.\n\n##\n Privileged\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Grant**  | **Description**  |\n|\n Alerts\n  | * Create, edit and share any Alerts to which you have access.\n* View, edit, add, or delete Alert Actions on any Alert of which the user is owner.\n |\n|\n Appstore\n  | * Install and use Apps from the Appstore.
