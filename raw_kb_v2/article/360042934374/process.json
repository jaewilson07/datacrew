Both SAML and OIDC Connect can run at the same time. This makes it easy to segment internal and external users. This is also useful for separating the SSO solutions you use for Domo access and\n                         \n                          Enabling SSO with OpenID Connect\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Using SAML, administrators can enable Single Sign-On into Domo. Once Single Sign-On has been enabled, new users are automatically provisioned from LDAP, and LDAP groups can be imported from an existing identity provider.\n                       \n\n                        To use SAML, you must have a cloud identity provider (IDP) or federation service in place that supports authentication via SAML 2.0.\u00a0For more information about SAML 2.0, see\n                        \n                         http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0\n                        \n\n\n                        You can add specific users to the Direct Sign-On List to enable them to bypass SSO and sign into Domo directly. These users can then toggle login modes (Direct or Single Sign-On) from the Domo login screen. This is especially useful in situations where you want to grant Domo access to contractors or non-employees who are not given accounts in the company\u2019s email or directory system.\n                       \n\n                        You must have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"Manage All Company Settings\" enabled to set up SAML.\u00a0For more information about default roles, see\n                        \n                         Managing Custom Roles\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Domo provides three methods of setting up SSO:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Manual Setup\n                          \n                          . This is the \"traditional\" method for setting up SSO in Domo.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Metadata Upload\n                          \n                          . This method allows you to retrieve your\u00a0configuration information and digital certificate just by entering the URL for your identity provider. Be aware that\u00a0not all identity providers offer this service.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Setup Wizard\n                          \n                          . This wizard guides you through the difficult jargon and details of SSO\u00a0configuration. The wizard offers context-based instructions for a number of leading identity provider services, including Okta, Ping, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, and more.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Of these methods, metadata upload is strongly recommended, as you only need to enter your identity provider URL\u2014the rest of the work is done automatically. If this method is not supported by your identity provider, it is recommended you use the setup wizard. Manual setup is recommended only if neither of the other two methods meet your needs.\n                       \n\n                        This topic first explains the components of the Single Sign-On tab user interface in Domo. It then gives provides instructions for configuring SSO\u00a0using the three available methods.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Notes:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                              Enabling SSO turns off the traditional Domo\u00a0login. Users should typically be assigned to the application in your IDP before SSO is enabled to avoid interruption.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Once SSO is enabled, invited users may need to be assigned to Domo in the identity provider before they can sign in (depends on company IDP policies).\n                             \n\n\n\n                              If SSO is enabled but you are unable to log in, you can log in with prior\u00a0Domo credentials by going to\n                              \n\n\n                                 https://<subdomain>.domo.com/auth/index?domoManualLogin=true\n                                \n\n\n                              . You must have an \"Admin\" default security role, a custom role with \"Manage All Company Settings\" enabled, or be on the Direct Sign On list to use this manual login.\u00a0For more information about default roles, see\n                              \n                               Managing Custom Roles\n                              \n                              .\n                             \n\n\n\n                              You can disable SSO at any time. This turns on the traditional email and password login. Users who had existing logins can use their old passwords or reset their passwords from the login page. Users with \"Admin\" security roles can also manually reset user passwords by going to the\n                              \n                               People\n                              \n                              sub-tab for the specific individual in Admin Settings and clicking\n                              \n                               Reset Password\n                              \n                              .\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Users of the Domo Mobile application can log in to Domo by entering their company's subdomain, then entering their IDP username and password in the web view.\u00a0SP initiated authentication is required for the Mobile App to work with SSO.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              When SSO is turned on, it is not possible to directly change a user\u2019s email address, even if you have an \"Admin\" default security role. This is because the email is the key used to match users logging in from SSO with users inside Domo. Changing it would cause the person to have a new user the next time they sign in, and all of their permissions would be lost.\u00a0If you absolutely\n                              \n                               must\n                              \n                              change a user's email address (for example, perhaps a user gets married and their last name changes), the best way to do so is by using the\n                              \n                               Bulk Import\n                              \n                              option in the\n                              \n                               More >\n                              \n\n                               Admin > Governance > People\n                              \n                              sub-tab.\u00a0For more information, see\n                              \n                               Adding Users to Domo\n                              \n                              .\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - SAML Single Sign On (SSO)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Parts of the Single Sign-On tab\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        The following table lists and describes the various components of the\n                        \n                         More >\n                        \n\n                         Admin > Authentication > SAML (SSO)\n                        \n                        tab in Domo:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Component\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Description\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Revert All\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Reverts your SSO configuration back to the most recently saved settings.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Save Config\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Saves the current configuration.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Test Config\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Tests the current configuration.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Wizard option\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Opens the SSO configuration wizard.
