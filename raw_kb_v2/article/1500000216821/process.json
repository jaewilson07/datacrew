Like Amazon S3, Domo is built to scale with your business. Our customers collectively upload new data into their Domo environments millions of times each week. Have datasets that exceed 50 billion rows? No problem, Domo is built to handle huge amounts of data with speed. Domo\u2019s S3 connector will allow you to leverage all of your S3 data anytime, anywhere.\n                        \n                        Domo connects directly to S3 and delivers the information you need in real-time visualizations that make analysis easier. Plus, you can see your S3 data alongside metrics from any other system, all in a single platform, and get instant notifications when your metrics hit thresholds that you determine.\n                        \n                        If your Amazon S3 bucket contains multiple files that begin with the prefix string you provide in the Details section of the connector, the Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced connector will import all files with the provided prefix, assuming they all have the same schema. Use Domo's\u00a0Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced Connector to connect your S3 bucket data with the Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced integration that imports all files with the same prefix.\u00a0To learn more about the Amazon S3 API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        The Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced connector is a \"File\" connector, meaning it retrieves files and outputs them to Domo. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other File connectors by clicking\n                        \n\n                          File\n                         \n\n                        in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your Amazon S3 account in the Data Center.
