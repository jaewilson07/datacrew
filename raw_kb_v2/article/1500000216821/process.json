Like Amazon S3, Domo is built to scale with your business. Our customers collectively upload new data into their Domo environments millions of times each week. Have datasets that exceed 50 billion rows? No problem, Domo is built to handle huge amounts of data with speed. Domo\u2019s S3 connector will allow you to leverage all of your S3 data anytime, anywhere.\n\n\n Domo connects directly to S3 and delivers the information you need in real-time visualizations that make analysis easier. Plus, you can see your S3 data alongside metrics from any other system, all in a single platform, and get instant notifications when your metrics hit thresholds that you determine.\n\n\n If your Amazon S3 bucket contains multiple files that begin with the prefix string you provide in the Details section of the connector, the Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced connector will import all files with the provided prefix, assuming they all have the same schema. Use Domo's\u00a0Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced Connector to connect your S3 bucket data with the Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced integration that imports all files with the same prefix.\u00a0To learn more about the Amazon S3 API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html\n\n).\n\n\n The Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced connector is a \"File\" connector, meaning it retrieves files and outputs them to Domo. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other File connectors by clicking\n ****File****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Amazon S3 account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon S3 AssumeRole Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Best Practices\n----------------\n\nUnderstanding the data stored in S3 and its relation to other S3 databases will be a huge asset in using this connector.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Amazon S3 account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.\n* The identifier for the assumed role session. You will need to set up a trust policy. This is described in continuation.\n* The unique identifier used by third parties when assuming roles in their customers' accounts.\n* The name of the Amazon S3 bucket you want to pull data from.\n* Your\u00a0Amazon S3 Region.\n\n\n###\n Trust policy configuration\n\nThe trust policy for the role session identifier should look as follows:\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\n\n \"Principal\": {\n\n\n \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::*accountId*:root\"\n\n\n },\n\n\n \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n\n\n \"Condition\": {\n\n\n \"StringEquals\": {\n\n\n \"sts:ExternalId\": \"*customer externalID*\"\n\n\n }\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n\n Account IDs for Domo environments are as follows:\n\n US: 339405024189\n* AU: 010251424122\n* EMEA (IE): 687132894031\n* JP: 622384692065\n* CA: 710710207408\n\n\n###\n FAQs\n\nQ:\u00a0What is ARN? Can it\u00a0be a user or a role?\n\n\n A: ARN is Amazon Resource Name (ARN). It must be a role.\n\n\n Q: What is the Role Session Name? Do I\u00a0need to establish it\u00a0on the trust policy or within the\u00a0AWS environment first?\n\n\n A: The Role Session Name is\u00a0the identifier for the assumed role session. It\u00a0can be any name you choose.\n\n\n Q: Can I get a detailed example of a principal trust policy and connector config?\n\n\n A: Below is what the trust policy should look like for a customer in us-east-1.\n\n\n****Note****\n : You\u00a0need to replace the EXTERNAL\\_ID with the ID generated by DOMO on the Connector Credentials section UI.\n\n\n {\n\n\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\n\n \"Principal\":\n\n\n { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::339405024189:root\" }\n\n\n ,\n\n\n \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n\n\n \"Condition\": {\n\n\n \"StringEquals\":\n\n\n { \"sts:ExternalId\": \"EXTERNAL\\_ID\" }\n\n\n }\n\n\n }\n\n####\n Description for\u00a0the fields in the connector configuration:\n\n***Role ARN****\n\n\n This is the ARN of the role that the customer created and added the trust policy to.\n\n\n****Role Session Name****\n\n\n This can be left as the default - \"Domo\".\n\n\n****External ID****\n\n\n This is the external ID that DOMO generated in the credentials section pane and put into their trust policy for the role.\n\n\n****Bucket****\n\n\n This is the S3 bucket the customer wants to get data out of.\n\n\n****Region****\n\n\n This is the AWS region in which their S3 bucket resides.\n\n\n Connecting to an Amazon S3 Bucket\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the Amazon S3 AssumedRole\u00a0Advanced Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to an Amazon S3 bucket. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Role ARN\n  |\n Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role you want to assume.\n  |\n|\n Role Session Name\n  |\n Enter the identifier for the assumed role session.\n  |\n|\n External ID\n  |\n Enter the unique identifier used by third parties when assuming roles in their customers' accounts.\n  |\n|\n Bucket\n  |\n Enter the Amazon S3 Bucket you want to pull files from.\n  |\n|\n Region\n  |\n Select the S3 Bucket Region where your file is located.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid Amazon S3 credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Amazon S3 AssumedRole\u00a0Advanced DataSet.
