Use Domo's\u00a0App Annie\u00a0connector to compile reports about accounts, products, advertising metrics, and the like. To learn more about the\u00a0App Annie\u00a0API, visit their website (\n\nhttps://support.appannie.com/hc/en-u...-Analytics-API\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your App Annie account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the App Annie connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to pull data about user accounts and mobile products.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Account Connections\n* Product Sales\n* Advertising Sales\n* Top Apps\n* Product Ratings\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Mobile app advertising\n* Manager\n* Analytics\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0App Annie\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the email address you use to log into App Annie, as well as your App Annie password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your App Annie Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the App Annie Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThe Domo App Annie connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing App Annie accounts in Domo) to open the App Annie OAuth screen where you can enter your App Annie credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new App Annie DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into App Annie when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Facebook or switch accounts (using the\n **Switch Accounts**\n option in the OAuth screen).\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the App Annie report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Connections List\n  |\n Retrieves all account connections available in\u00a0the authenticated user's account.\n  |\n|\n Account Connection Products List\n  |\n Retrieves the product list\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0selected account connection.\n  |\n|\n Account Connection Sales\n  |\n Retrieves sales information for the selected account connection.\n  |\n|\n Advertising Account Site & Campaign List\n  |\n Retrieves a list\u00a0of all sites and/or campaigns for a specific ad platform account.\n  |\n|\n App Site & Campaign List\n  |\n Retrieves a list of all sites and campaigns linked to\u00a0the selected app.\n  |\n|\n IAP List\n  |\n Retrieves the In Product Purchase list\u00a0for the selected\u00a0product.\n  |\n|\n Product Sales\n  |\n Retrieves sales data for the selected\u00a0product, such as number of downloads, refunds, etc.\n  |\n|\n Shared Products List\n  |\n Retrieves a list of shared products the authenticated user may have access to.\n  |\n|\n User Advertising Sales\n  |\n Returns advertising metrics for the authenticated user.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Account Name\n  |\n Select the account you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Breakdown\n  |\n Select the dimension the\u00a0report data should be broken down by.\n  |\n|\n Currency\n  |\n Select the world currency you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Product\n  |\n Select whether to return data for a specified product or all products.\n  |\n|\n Product Name\n  |\n Select the product you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of days back you want to retrieve data for.
