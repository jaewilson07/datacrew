 Connecting to Your App Annie Account
--------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the App Annie Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

.


###

Credentials Pane

The Domo App Annie connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing App Annie accounts in Domo) to open the App Annie OAuth screen where you can enter your App Annie credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new App Annie DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into App Annie when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Facebook or switch accounts (using the
 **Switch Accounts**
 option in the OAuth screen).
