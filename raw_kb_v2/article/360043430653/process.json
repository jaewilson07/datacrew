When switching DataSets, a warning appears if the schemas do not match. You can proceed to switch the DataSet, despite the warning, but doing so may affect cards powered by the DataSet.\n* When cards are moved to the target DataSet, Beast Mode calculations associated with a card are moved with the card and Beast Mode calculations associated with the current DataSet are copied to the target DataSet.\n* Connecting cards to a different DataSet\u00a0will not switch the DataSets of any drill path cards listed on the card page. Cards with drill paths include a banner to help you differentiate them.\n\n\n**Video - Switching Cards to a Different DataSet**\n\n*To switch all cards powered by\u00a0a DataSet to another DataSet,**\n\n. Click\n **Data**\n in the toolbar at the top of the screen.\n\n\n The Data Center opens, with the\n **Data Warehouse**\n tab opened by default.\n2. Click the\n\nicon on the left side of the screen to open the\n **DataSets**\n tab.\n3. Locate and click\u00a0the current DataSet containing the cards you want to move.\n4. In the DataSet details\u00a0view, click the\n **Cards**\n tab.\n5. Click\n **Switch cards to a different DataSet**\n .\n\n\n This option appears if you are the owner of the DataSet, depending on the DataSet type.\n\n\n A list of DataSets appears.\n6. Select the DataSet you want to move the cards to.\n\n\n A confirmation dialog appears.\n\n\n If the target DataSet does not have the same columns, names, and data types as the current DataSet, a warning appears indicating that any cards powered by the DataSet may break. However, you can still move the cards to the new DataSet if you want.\n7. Click\n **Yes, Switch to New DataSet**\n to confirm.\n\n\n The cards are moved to the target DataSet.\n8. Verify that the cards are properly powered using the switched DataSet.\n\nSwitching a single card powered by a DataSet\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTo switch a single card\u00a0powered by\u00a0a given\u00a0DataSet to a different DataSet, you use the\n **Change DataSet**\n option.\n\n*Notes:**\n Using this method,\n\n\n* You\n *cannot*\n switch all cards using a DataSet to another DataSet but must switch a single card to another DataSet.\n* For best results, the target DataSet\n *should*\n have the same schema (columns, names, and data types) as the current DataSet.\n\n\n You can switch DataSets when the schemas do\n *not*\n match. When switching DataSets, a warning appears if the schemas do not match. You can proceed to switch the DataSet, despite the warning, but doing so may affect cards powered by the DataSet.\n* When cards are moved to the target DataSet, Beast Mode calculations associated with a card are moved with the card and Beast Mode calculations associated with the current DataSet are copied to the target DataSet.\n\n*To switch a single card connected to a DataSet to a different DataSet,**\n\n. Mouse over the card whose DataSet you want to change.\n2. Click\n\n, then select\n **Connect / Update Data**\n from the menu.\n\n\n A dialog appears.\n\n*Tip:**\n You can also open this dialog in a KPI card's Details view, by clicking the\n **Update Data**\n link near the bottom of the screen.\n3. Select\n **Change DataSet**\n .\n\n\n The dialog expands to display DataSet types (existing data, Microsoft Excel, Google Drive, Domo online form).\n4. Depending on the DataSet type you are switching to, do one of the following:\n\n* (Conditional) If switching to an existing DataSet, do the following:\n\n\t1. Click\n\t\t **Existing Data**\n\t\t , select the DataSet you want to connect to the card, then click\n\t\t **Select DataSet**\n\t\t .\n\n\n\t\t A confirmation dialog appears.\n\n\n\t\t If the target DataSet does not have the same columns, names, and data types as the current DataSet, a warning appears indicating that any cards powered by the DataSet may break.
