The Domo LinkedIn Connector integrates Domo with LinkedIn to extract data from the LinkedIn API. The connector provides access to company profiles and updates and follower information. To learn


 more about the LinkedIn API, visit their site (

https://developer.linkedin.com

).


 The LinkedIn connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


**Important:**
 Certain connectors require an API usage fee charged to you by the company, not Domo, depending on the customers' accounts with that company. Use of this connector may require an API usage fee.


**Important:**
 LinkedIn has announced that they are disabling version 1 of their API on May 1, 2019. This is the API used by the LinkedIn and LinkedIn Enterprise connectors. LinkedIn has released a new version of the API, which has been implemented in Domo as the connector LinkedIn V2. Due to the two versions being considerably different, there is no way to automatically migrate existing LinkedIn DataSets to the new LinkedIn V2 connector. You will need to create new DataSets using the LinkedIn V2 connector. If there are metrics or features that are not available in the new connector, please contact Domo Support as soon as possible so those features can be added to the new connector.


 These changes do not apply to DataSets using the LinkedIn Ads connector as it is already on the new API version.


 You connect to your LinkedIn account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the LinkedIn connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Prerequisites

To connect to your LinkedIn account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The email address you use to log in to LinkedIn
* The password you use to log in to LinkedIn

Connecting to Your LinkedIn Account
-------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the LinkedIn Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo LinkedIn connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing LinkedIn accounts in Domo)


 to open the LinkedIn OAuth screen where you can enter the email address and password you use to log in to LinkedIn. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new LinkedIn DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* The LinkedIn user account used to create the DataSet
 *must*
 have access to a Company page. Otherwise the connector will not be able to pull any data.
* LinkedIn access tokens stay valid until the number of seconds returned in the

expires\_in

field in the API response. Currently, all access tokens are issued with a 60-day lifespan.
