The connector provides access to company profiles and updates and follower information.\u00a0To learn\n\n\n more about the\u00a0LinkedIn API, visit their site (\n\nhttps://developer.linkedin.com\n\n).\n\n\n The LinkedIn connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n**Important:**\n Certain connectors require an API usage fee charged to you by the company, not Domo, depending on the customers' accounts with that company. Use of this connector may require an API usage fee.\n\n\n**Important:**\n LinkedIn has announced that they are disabling version 1 of their API on May 1, 2019. This is the API used by the LinkedIn and LinkedIn Enterprise connectors. LinkedIn has released a new version of the API, which has been implemented in Domo\u00a0as the connector LinkedIn V2. Due to the two versions being considerably different, there is no way to automatically migrate existing LinkedIn DataSets to the new LinkedIn V2 connector. You will need to create new DataSets using the LinkedIn V2 connector. If there are metrics or features that are not available in the new connector, please contact Domo Support as soon as possible so those features can be added to the new connector.\n\n\n These changes do not apply to DataSets using the LinkedIn Ads connector as it is already on the new API version.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0LinkedIn account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0LinkedIn connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing\u00a0DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is useful for measuring engagement from company updates and posts.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Company follow statistics\n* Post likes\n* Post comments\n* Share statistics\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Marketing roles, especially those involving social engagement\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 10 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0LinkedIn account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you use to log in to LinkedIn\n* The password you use to log in to LinkedIn\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0LinkedIn Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0LinkedIn Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0LinkedIn connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0LinkedIn accounts in Domo)\n\n\n to open the\u00a0LinkedIn OAuth screen where you can enter the email address and password you use to log in to LinkedIn. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0LinkedIn DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report\n\ns**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the LinkedIn report you want to run.

Otherwise\u00a0the connector will not be able to pull any data.\n* LinkedIn access tokens stay valid until the number of seconds returned in the\n\nexpires\\_in\n\nfield in the API response.\u00a0Currently, all access tokens are issued with a 60-day lifespan.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434493\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003468\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nLinkedIn Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,817\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "linkedin_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
