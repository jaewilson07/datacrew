This means\u00a0that Domo determines\u00a0the most appropriate\u00a0date grain\u00a0and output format for your data.\u00a0If\u00a0there are\u00a0periods with no data, gaps are shown accordingly in the timeline. All of the following chart types use automatic time scale formatting.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Vertical bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Vertical stacked bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Symbol line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Curved line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Curved symbol line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Multi-line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Running total bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Running total line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Vertical box plot\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Vertical grouped bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Grouped bar with line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Stacked bar with line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Grouped bar with symbol\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Stacked bar with symbol\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Running total grouped\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For chart types not in this list, date and time information appears as\u00a0it does\u00a0in your DataSet.

So, for example, the week of January 8th to the 14th would be represented as \"1-8\" instead of \"Week 2.\"\u00a0Only users with an \"Admin\" default security role\u00a0or a custom role with the \"Manage All Company Settings\" grant can do this.
