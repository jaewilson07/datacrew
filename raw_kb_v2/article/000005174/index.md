###
 Beast Mode Editor

New Features
--------------

The following features are part of the October 2022 release.

###
 Variables


 Variables are values that function inside Beast Modes and provide solutions for many use cases, including what-if analysis and time comparisons. Use Variables with cards in Analyzer or turn dashboards into fully functioning data apps.


 The Edit Variables grant allows anyone in your organization with the Edit Cards grant to create, edit, and delete Variables.


 With three new DomoStats reports, admins can quickly see what Variables exist in an instance, who is using them, and where they are being used to assist with data governance.


 Variables are now available in the enhanced Beast Mode Editor.

 Story Presentation Mode

With Story Presentation Mode, your presentations are smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable for your audience. You can easily view details about your data in the control rail and move to any card on the dashboard without exiting the presentation. Our new Variables feature works with cards in Story Presentation Mode, too.

####
 Password Blocklist

Admins can now create a list of restricted passwords for their instances. This prevents unauthorized or leaked credential usage and keeps instances more secure. This feature does not impact passwords that are currently used, only future passwords.

 New Premium Features
----------------------

The following premium features are part of the October 2022 release.

###
 Domo Everywhere

*UI**


 Domo Everywhere has an improved user interface, which you can access in the Domo Admin Settings. Customize your organization's appearance with Brand Kit, or distribute live data experiences with the new options available in Domo Everywhere.

*Publish Dynamic PDP**


 Publish jobs are now more secure. With dynamic personalized data permissions (PDP), you can know that your sensitive data is only going to the customers who should see it. Apply a user or organization-based Filter, and only content that passes the Filter is visible to subscribers.


 For more information, see

Publishing Content to a Subscriber Organization.

*Embed Authorized Domains**


 With authorized domains, you control the portals, environments, and apps where your embedded data displays. Place any authorized domain on the list in your Domo environment. This tells Domo that you trust the domain and that your content can be shared there. Domains not on the list aren't allowed to host Domo content.


 For more information, see

Sharing Content Outside of Domo with Embed

.


**Whole-Page Filtering**

Now you can use Whole-Page Filtering on embedded content in your authorized domains. This gives you both control over the format and layout offered by Embed and the power and functionality of dashboard Filters. Create Filters for your customers' use cases and easily apply them to every embedded card on a page.

###
 Form Builder

The new Editable Submissions feature in Form Builder allows form creators to configure forms to be view-only or allow responses to be viewed, edited, and deleted. Form viewers can review their Previous Submissions in table format before resubmitting. New styling options offer enhanced design choices for fonts, rounded corners, and more.

###
 Sandbox


**Support for Connectors, Variables, and Segments**

Sandbox now supports Connectors. This allows users to transport Connector configurations from their source instance into target instances. Additionally, Sandbox supports cards and dashboards that contain Variables and Segments.


**Link Mapping**


 Sandbox now gives users mappings for items in their repositories during the promotion process. For example, if your page contains a link that isn't in the repository, Sandbox allows users to map the link.


**Heuristic Content Mapping**


 Sandbox now automates the mapping process if your DataSets have similar details, such as names or schema types. This saves time if you use similar naming conventions across your instances.


**Repository Sharing**


 Sandbox now allows you to share repositories with groups created in Domo.


 For more information, see

Domo Sandbox

 Jupyter administrators can now enable workspace sharing, allowing other users to run and edit workspaces without sharing login credentials.
