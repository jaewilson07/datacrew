The CA Agile Center QuickStart provides summary views on your teams' iterations, velocities and their corresponding status. Also, this QuickStart will track your teams' assignments and tasks so you can stay on top of your development efforts.\n\n\n Usage\n-------\n\nBusiness questions that can be answered:\n\n What iterations are causing the most defects?\n* How many stories are we completing?\n* What tasks are taking the longest to complete?\n* How quickly is your team delivering on assignments?\n\nMetrics included in the app:\n\n All Stories\n* Blocked vs. Completed Tasks\n* Completed Stories\n* Iteration Status\n* Iterations\n* Open Defect Priority\n* Open Defects\n* Open Defects Severity\n* Perfect vs. Defective\n* Planned Velocity\n* Remaining vs. Estimated\n* Story Plan Estimation\n* Story Status\n* Story Velocity Points\n* Task Status\n\nAuthentication\n----------------\n\nCA Agile Center API Key and CA Agile Center URL are required.\n\n\n To obtain\u00a0a CA Agile Center API Key, do the following:\n\n. Log into CA Agile Center Application Manager with your CA Agile Center username and password at the following URL:\n\n\n https://CA Agile Center1.CA Agile Centerdev.com/login\n2. Click on the\n **API KEYS**\n tab at the top of the page.\n3. Click the\n **Create New API Key**\n link.\n4. Enter a name or description for the key in the\n **Description**\n field (e.g. \"Domo API Connection\").\n5. Select the\n **Full Access**\n option from the\n **Grants**\n section.\n6. Click the\n **Create**\n button.\n\nTo obtain a CA Agile Center URL, e\n\nnter the URL for your CA Agile Center account (e.g.\n\nhttps://CA\n\nAgile\n\nCenter1.CA\n\nAgile\n\nCenterdev.com\n\n).\n\nQuickStart Reports\n--------------------\n\nFor report descriptions, see\n\nCA Agile Center Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Report Configuration / Report Details\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe selectable reports will need to be configured as follows:\n\n\n Report\n  |\n Scheduling (Change update settings)\n  |\n Parameter(s)\n  |\n Selection\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Blocker\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Build\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Custom Object\n  |\n |\n Custom Object Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the object you want to retrieve as it appears in the API documentation. For example, the Hierarchical Requirement object shows the URL as /webservice/v2.0/hierarchicalrequirement/. You would enter 'hierarchicalrequirement' into the text input box.\n\n\n |\n|\n Defect\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Hierarchical Requirement\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Iteration\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Iteration Cumulative Flow Data\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Preference\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Project\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Release Cumulative Flow Data\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n SCM Repository\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Subscription\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Task\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n User\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n User Iteration Capacity\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n|\n Workspace Configuration\n  |\n |\n None\n  |\n |\n\nQuickStart Data\n-----------------\n\nThe CA Agile CenterSoftware QuickStart will provide the following data collections and cards:\n\n\n Collection\n\n\n |\n Card\n  |\n Card Description\n  |\n Data Name\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Executive Pulse: 4 metrics you should track daily.\n  |\n Completed Stories\n  |\n COMPLETED STORIES\n\nTracks how many stories each team member has completed in the period.
