As data continues to flow into businesses like never before and the breadth of different data sources increases, the new Analyzer is an analytic heaven for analysts to explore, discover, slice\u00a0and\u00a0dice, and empower others to stop making decisions with their gut and start making decisions with data.\n                       \n\n                        All of the following new and updated features are now available:\n                       \n\n\n                         User Interface\n                        \n                        . We\u2019ve added a beautiful new design with additional flexibility so you can be the driver of your own workspace, using the analytic tools you want when you need them.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about the Analyzer user interface, see\n                        \n                         Analyzer Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n                         Period-over-Period\n                        \n                        .\u00a0With the powerful and flexible Period-over-Period experience in Analyzer, you\u2019ll be able to compare numerous time periods to see trends and comparisons. No other BI tool has an easier Period-over-Period experience. All you need is a date range, and your options are endless: Year over Year, Quarter over Quarter, Past 30 days, and many other options. Want to see a growth trend in your sales performance for the past few years, and add a variance percentage line along with that? Done and done.\u00a0Measure the past 30 days vs any previous days? Compare monthly sales to the same day 4, 8, 12, even 52 weeks ago? We've\u00a0got you covered. Analyzer makes the visualization of trends even easier.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about implementing Period-over-Period chart, including use cases, see\n                        \n                         Period-over-Period Charts\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n                         Quick Filters\n                        \n                        . Quick Filters are pre-defined filters that live on a card to help guide and focus management to see results in specific areas. As analysts explore their data and find important insights, they want to share these answers with management. With Quick Filters, you now can easily create a self-guided experience for others to explore data on a card and answer questions for themselves. Quick Filters you set will appear on cards in both the desktop and mobile versions of Domo.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about Quick Filters, see\n                        \n                         Adding Filters to Your Chart - Applying Quick Filters\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n                         Data Lineage\n                        \n                        .\u00a0Trusting your data is critical. As you find answers and explore your data, you need to be confident all the data is up-to-date and running smoothly. Since Domo can effectively bring all your data into one place as no other tool can, you may need to see all your data is combining correctly for true peace of mind. With the new Data Lineage in Analyzer, you can see the data is flowing correctly and on time without having to check the Data Center.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Viewing the Lineage of a DataSet in Analyzer\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n                         Conditional Colors\n                        \n                        .\u00a0As analysts explore their data, it\u2019s often important to have consistent colors in order to highlight exceptions. If, for instance, you want a specific company to be blue or red on a DataSet to more easily identify those trends spanning many charts, you would need the Conditional Color in Analyzer. This new feature enables you to see exceptions and trends with a consistent color\u2014making analysis even easier.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Setting Color Rules for a Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         Data Table\n                        \n                        .\u00a0The new Data Table in Analyzer allows you to see and manipulate the data in all columns you have applied to your chart, along with any other unused columns you want to show. Changes you make to the data in the Data Table are reflected in your chart preview. Likewise, when you make changes to the chart using other tools such as filters and sorting, the data in the table is updated.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Understanding the Data Table in Analyzer\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n                         60+ New Chart Types and Improved Table Card\n                        \n                        .

Now you can clarify the chaos with the new Snapshot Annotation feature. Pictures are worth a thousand words, and probably more when working with data. Snapshot Annotations makes analytic life easier for everyone.\n                        \n\n                        With the Snapshot Annotation feature, you don\u2019t need to use thousands of words to call out trends and insights. When you see a spike or trends in your data, you can now annotate on any card. Specifically, you can now draw free-form, place shapes, write text, and highlight, on any card\u2014 both on the web and on your mobile device. Then, once you\u2019ve made things more clear, sharing annotated cards is seamless in Buzz. Everyone now can spend less typing and more time making business decisions.\n                        \n\n                        Analysts, Managers, Senior Execs, and all data consumers need tools to help craft their data story or to visually call attention to important trends and differences on their charts. Having annotation tools makes analytic life easier for everyone because it's more efficient to communicate with visual tools to help educate others.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about this feature, see\n                        \n                         Taking Snapshots of Cards\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        New Self-Service Connectors\n                       \n\n\n\n                          This month we have polished and released another 18 connectors that are now available to all customers in their Domo account.

When you configure this connector, it generates a unique email address that corresponds to your Dataset via Email DataSet in Domo. Once the email address is created, you can send the spreadsheet as an attachment to that email address. The connector will then process the email and update your data accordingly.\n                       \n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         DataSet via Email Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Workbench UI Improvements\n                       \n\n                        List View\n                       \n\n                        Workbench now includes\u00a0a list view that allows\u00a0you to\u00a0search\u00a0and sort\u00a0DataSet jobs, see upcoming schedules, and organize jobs by status,\u00a0giving better visibility into jobs to facilitate job management\u00a0in an instance.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Status Panel\n                       \n\n                        The new Status Panel in Workbench provides you with\u00a0better insights around when jobs are being run and allows\u00a0you\u00a0to make changes, pause, cancel and run jobs.
