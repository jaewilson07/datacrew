To learn more about the Microsoft Exchange API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exc...s-and-contacts\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Exchange account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Exchange connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Exchange Mailbox mailbox and create a DataSet, you must have a Microsoft Exchange client ID and client secret. For information about obtaining these credentials, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/get-started\n\n. You must also have your Microsoft credentials (the email address, phone number, or Skype handle associated with your account, as well as your password).\n\n\n Connecting to Your Microsoft Exchange Account\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Microsoft Exchange Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to the Microsoft Exchange REST API. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Microsoft Exchange client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Microsoft Exchange client secret.\n  |\n\nFor information, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/get-started\n\n.\n\nAfter you have entered your API credentials, you are taken to the Microsoft OAuth screen where you are prompted to enter your Microsoft credentials. Once you have entered valid\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Microsoft Exchange DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Configuring Your Azure App\n\nTo create a connection with your Microsoft Exchange Mailbox account, you must first create a Microsoft Azure Web App to obtain the necessary client ID and secret.\n\n\n**To configure an Azure App**\n :\n\n\n 1. Log into the\n\nAzure Portal\n\n.\n\n\n 2. Click\n **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > New Registration**\n .\n\n3.\u00a0Fill out the registration form as follows:\n\n Name: Enter name for your application.\n* Supported account types: Select an option to specify who\u00a0can use this application or access this API.\n* Redirect URI: Enter the redirect URI as:\n **https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/mail-exchange-rest-mailbox-only/exchange**\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The authentication response is sent to this URI after successfully authenticating the user. Providing the URI at this stage is optional and it can be changed later, but a value is required for most of the authentication scenarios.\n\n\n 4. Click\n **Register**\n . An overview of your registered App will appear.\u00a0The\n **Application ID**\n that appears here\u00a0is the\n **Client ID**\n you will enter in the\n **Credentials**\n pane in Domo.\n\n\n 5.\u00a0Click\n **API Permissions >> +Add a permission**\n .\n\n6.\n **Request API permissions**\n section appears. Add the API permissions for your application.\n\n7. Now, click on\n **Certificates and secrets**\n . Certificates can be used as secrets to prove the application's identity when requesting a token. Also, can be referred to as public keys.\n\n\n 8. Click\n **+New client secret**\n .\n\n9.\u00a0Specify the client secret description and the expiry period for your client secret, and click\n **Add**\n .\n\n\n 10. Copy the value and paste it into the\n **Client Secret**\n field in the\n **Connector credentials**\n section in Domo.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Microsoft Exchange report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Messages\n  |\n\nReturns message details like recipients, body, subject, size, importance, sender's name, received time, sent time, etc.\n\n|\n\n|\n|\n Folder\n  |\n Select the folder containing the content you want to import.\n  |\n|\n Search Type\n  |\n Select the search type.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Search\n  |\n Returns results based on search criteria.

Use the Filter option to retrieve just a subset of a collection.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Filter Type\n  |\n\nSelect Filter type. If the filter type is\n\n*Starts with**\n\n, then the connector will perform a\n\n*Starts with**\n\nmatch for the given inputs (from, subject). If the search type is\n\n*Equals**\n\n, then the connector will an perform exact search for the given inputs (from, subject).\n\n|\n|\n Subject (Optional)\n  |\n\nEnter the subject to find all the emails for the given subject.\n\n|\n|\n From (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the email id of the user to filter returned data specific to that user.\n  |\n|\n Search Option\n  |\n Select the desired search method.

If you do not enter a number, the first row is considered the header row.\n  |\n|\n Data Start Row (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the starting data row number. If you do not enter a number, the first row after the header row is considered the starting row.\n  |\n|\n Footer Rows to Skip\u00a0(Optional)\n  |\n If there are one or more rows at the bottom of the file you do not want to import, enter the number of rows to skip.\n  |\n|\n Sheet Name (Optional)\n  |\n If the Excel file you are uploading is found on a specific sheet, enter the sheet name here.
