This means processing more data faster for more people. As these needs grow, you need solutions that help maintain and process all that data, without sacrificing the agility and control required to achieve your most audacious goals. Domo Enterprise Toolkit is a collection of tools and features to help you maintain control, security, and consistency within your Domo environment as the depth and breadth of your data solutions expand.\n\n\n Toolkit Elements\n------------------\n\nThere are three main elements within the Domo Enterprise Toolkit:\n\n Sandbox\n* Governance Toolkit\n* Brand Kit\n\n*Sandbox: Encourage Innovation While Maintaining Control**\n\n\n End users rely on everything running perfectly, without the hiccups or downtime that can happen when changing or testing a new visualization.
