Use search facets such as date, number of cards, and owner. Use our new sort-by menu to sort by Name, Number of Cards, Update Date, and Status. And by choosing to sort either Ascending or Descending, you can quickly find that DataSet you need, or maybe all those old, unused DataSets you want to delete.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Use our new tagging functionality to really up your organizational game. Once you have DataSets tagged to get a better understanding of your DataSets, you can find them quickly and easily. Use tags to show which DataSets are works-in-progress and which are marked to be deleted at a future date.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Take bulk actions on DataSets. When you hover over an item, select the checkbox that appears on the left. Once you have them selected, you can delete, run, tag, or change owner on these DataSets in bulk. Try holding down the Shift key to select many DataSets at once.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Welcome to the new Data Center. Managing data has never been this much fun.\n                        \n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Data Center Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        SSO for Everyone\n                       \n\n                        Domo now includes tools that enable customers to quickly set up Single Sign-on (SSO) in their instance. SSO is widely considered the best way to access enterprise applications\u00a0because it simplifies login, while improving management and security. But because of the complexity of SAML 2.0, managing\u00a0organizational processes, and configuring Domo itself, setup can take a very long time. Now, with Domo's new SSO setup tools, you\u00a0can confidently roll out SSO in a fraction of the\u00a0time you could before. The two new tools are...\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Metadata upload\n                          \n                          . Using Metadata Upload, you can enter the URL for your identity provider. Domo then automatically retrieves its configuration information and digital certificate. Domo can provide information back to the identity provider as well. This is the easiest and most reliable way to configure your SSO.\n                          \n                           Be aware that\u00a0not all identity providers offer this service.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Wizard\n                          \n                          . A new wizard interface guides you through the difficult jargon and details of SSO\u00a0configuration. The wizard offers context-based instructions for a number of leading identity provider services, including Okta, Ping, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, and more.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about SSO, see\n                        \n                         Understanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Date Annotations\n                       \n\n                        You can add now add\u00a0annotations to date items in any chart to provide the proper context for activity that took place on\u00a0those dates. For example, you could add date annotations to a chart to help you remember why you had that great day of sales or how you were able to drive so much traffic over a particular\u00a0weekend. These date annotations stay with their associated dates so your company knowledge stays with the data.\n                       \n\n                        Each annotation appears in an\n                        \n\n                          Annotations\n                         \n\n                        sidebar, with a colored flag that allows users to quickly match the annotation with its associated data point.\n                       \n\n                        This functionality is available\n                        \n\n                          only\n                         \n\n                        for charts containing date/time data.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Adding Date Annotations\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Updated Licensing Manager\n                       \n\n                        The\n                        \n                         Licenses\n                        \n                        page in the Admin Settings now gives you a quick view of the licenses you've already paid for as well as the number of \"courtesy licenses\"\u2014the number of users in your company using Domo in excess of your paid license count.

If you want to upgrade these users, you can do so right from this view. To help\u00a0inform your decisions, Domo provides information about when these users last logged in, who they report to, and their department and job titles. Because social users can request upgrades to full licenses of Domo, you can also view the list of social users who have requested licenses. You can easily approve or deny any of these requests and specify the Domo role each person receives. You can also email requesters about your decisions.\n                       \n\n                        These new license management features help you get all your people collaborating in Domo\u2014for the good of the company.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about licensing, see\n                        \n                         Adding User Licenses in Domo\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Mobile Help Center\n                       \n\n                        To provide better self-service for mobile users of Domo, we have added a Help Center within our iOS and Android applications.
