For an overview, see\n\nMagic ETL Tiles: Scripting\n\n.\n\n\n In this article, we\u2019ll provide an overview of your default environment and how to add a custom environment for R and Python that meets your DataFlow needs.\n\n\n**Important:**\n We strongly recommend reading the\n\n\n Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL\n\n\n article before converting mission-critical Magic ETL DataFlows.\n **Failure to do so may risk an unintended change to your DataFlow\u2019s behavior.**\n\n*Note:**\n This feature is available\n *on demand and paid*\n .\n\nTo request this feature be enabled, reach out to your Customer Success Manager (CSM), Technical Consultant (TC), or Account Executive (AE). If you do not have contact information for them, see\n\nGetting Help.\n\nDepending on the feature, you may be required to complete training before you can use the feature.\n\n\n Default Environment\n---------------------\n\nDomo 1.1 is your default environment. It includes over 400 R and Python packages.\n\nTo see the list of packages and versions included in your environment, select\n **Packages**\n . You can select a package to see its description and version.\n\n\n Custom Environment\n--------------------\n\nYou can issue a custom environment in your Domo instance by submitting a request to Domo Support. You can create custom environments for both R and Python, based on your needs.\n\n\n Please include the items below in your request to the Support team.\n\n Name you would like to use for the new environment (e.g., \u201cCustom-Py\u201d).\n* Description of the new environment.\n* Version of Python or R needed.\n* List of packages and respective versions (or minimal version.)\n\n\n**Important:**\n Custom environments do not contain all the packages included in the default environment. If a script is relying on a package available in the default environment, that package will need to be specified in the request for the custom environment.\n\nYour new environment will appear under\n **Environment**\n , and you will be able to select it for your DataFlow.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4662034775319\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004576\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nRequesting Custom Environments\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,786\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "requesting_custom_environments", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "magic_etl", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanvGAC"}]}
