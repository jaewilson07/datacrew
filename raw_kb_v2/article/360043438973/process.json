You can change the default name and description\u00a0(which remains unchanged unless you manually change it) by clicking within the name of description and making the changes. Once you have duplicated a role, you can change the grant configuration as desired, even if the original role was a default Domo role.\n                       \n\n                        As an\u00a0example, you might have a subset of users who should have Participant-level access\n                        \n                         except\n                        \n                        you also want them to be able to deploy Appstore\u00a0apps. In this case, you could easily create the new role by duplicating the Participant role, checking the box that reads \"Use Appstore,\" and saving. The new role is now available in your Domo and can be granted to new or existing users as necessary.\n                       \n\n\n                         Add People\n                        \n                        opens a list of all users in your Domo, which appears similar to the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Here you can quickly and easily switch users into the selected role by checking the boxes next to their names and clicking\n                        \n                         Add People\n                        \n                        .
