With our new drill reorder capability, that frustration is now a thing of the past. In the updated drill edit screen, drill path\u00a0levels are represented as movable tiles. If you add a level in the wrong sequence, worry not\u2014you can simply click and drag it almost\u00a0anywhere in the drill sequence\u00a0(except for to the top or bottom of the drill path, since those spots are reserved for your top level view and table view, respectively), automatically adjusting your card's drill path. You can also edit or delete any movable path in the sequence.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Adding Drill Path to Your Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Workbench 4.5\n                       \n\n                        Workbench 4.5 is being released. In addition to bug fixes, this release provides the following improvements designed to make your Workbench experience easier:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          You no longer have to be an Admin in Windows to run Workbench. Non-Admin users can now access Workbench as long as they are assigned to the \"Domo Workbench Users Group.\" All members of this group are allowed to configure and use Domo Workbench to upload data to Domo.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Previously all data readers would do impersonation. We now launch the Data Collector Process as an impersonated user, which should especially help plugin writers.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A new security option under\n                          \n                           Settings\n                          \n                          allows you to require impersonation credentials for all DataSet Jobs. This option can only be modified by an Admin user.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A new option under\n                          \n                           Additional Settings\n                          \n                          for a DataSet Job lets you specify whether the Job waits for Adrenaline indexing before completing.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          If you change the impersonation credentials on a DataSet Job, Workbench now asks you if you want to change the credentials for all jobs that use those credentials.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                          Likewise, if you change the impersonation credentials for a provider, you are asked if you want to\u00a0change credentials\u00a0on all Jobs that use that provider.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          In the Job Scheduler, if a DataSet Job is from a local file provider, you can now select\n                          \n                           Watch File\n                          \n                          for the Job. The Job will then run every time the\u00a0local\u00a0file is updated.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A new plugin platform allows for backwards compatibility with older plugins.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Password-protected Excel files are now supported.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          You can now change the name of a Workbench-imported DataSet in Domo.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Improved migration between Workbench 2 and Workbench 4.5.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        New Publication Groups UI\n                       \n\n                        The Publication Groups interface\u00a0has been enhanced to provide a more intuitive user experience. The interface now guides users through the process of adding pages, setting DataSet filters, and configuring access groups.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Setting Up Publication Groups\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         2-Factor Authentication\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n\n\n                             This feature is available\n                             \n\n\n                              on demand.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n                             To request that this feature be enabled,\n                            \n                            reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant.\n                           \n\n\n                             Depending on the feature, you may be required to complete training before you can use the feature.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         You can now\u00a0enable multi-factor authentication for your company.\n                        \n\n                         In\n                         \n\n\n\n                         Admin Settings > Security > Authentication\n                        \n\n                         , you have access to the following multi-factor authentication options:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                           You can set a requirement that users\u00a0redo their multi-factor authentication after a given number of days.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           You can\u00a0set a requirement that codes expire after a given number of failed attempts.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                          You can see a list of all users who have not\u00a0entered their mobile number into their\n                          \n                           Profile\n                          \n                          pages.

You can also refresh the logs appearing in the tab\u00a0or export the logs as a CSV file.

This representation was in SVG format\u00a0and could cause some confusion on what could be directly edited on the artboard versus within the configuration options for that widget. It also prevented exact representations for some widgets, such as the Table and YouTube Player from being shown accurately. The new HTML screenshot method gives a significant performance boost and more accurately represents how the widget will look once on the design. Whatever configurations are chosen for the widget, the artboard will replicate that. In addition, it will allow elements such as Legends to be moved more accurately on the design.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Some widgets are HTML based and require this upgrade to be available in the Add Widgets menu. This includes the Table, YouTube Player, some Maps, and Filter control widgets. \u00a0If you do not see these widgets on your list, you will need to upgrade to 2.0.6. \u00a0Any designs that were created in an older version of Design Studio will function normally.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        This release also includes\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Additional support for SSO authentication\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Updated Table widget instructional text\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Various bug fixes\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Page Search in More menu\n                       \n\n                        In the\n                        \n                         More\n                        \n                        menu in the card page navigation bar, you can\u00a0filter to show\u00a0the desired page(s) or subpage(s) with their owners.\u00a0By default,\u00a0only top-level pages appear in the\n                        \n                         More\n                        \n                        menu.
