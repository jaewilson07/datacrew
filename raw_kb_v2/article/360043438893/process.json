The Domo interface includes a number of\n                          \n                           Invite\n                          \n                          buttons in various locations, including the user Profile page, the card Details view, the Analyzer view, etc. If you have an \"Admin\" or \"Privileged\" default security role and you invite a user or users in this way, the new users are brought into Domo as the default role you have set for your instance (if you have not changed the default role, it is automatically set to \"Privileged\".) You can also invite users to Domo if you have a custom role with \"Add New People\" enabled. If you have this role AND \"Manage All Roles\" enabled, you can invite users to Domo and assign them to any custom role.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Social user invite.
