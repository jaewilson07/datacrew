It helps you to gather the health information datasets for various categories.\u00a0Once you have set up this connector, you can easily combine the latest business and health data with information from across your organization.\n\n\n The OrthoFi Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your OrthoFi account in the Data Center.
