You can easily find data to map your data to these codes online.\n                       \n\n                        The app supports the following region codes/types: CBSA for the USA, CMA for Canada, SA3 for Australia, and NUTS 2 for Europe.

Standard users aren't added to a group and receive the standard app privileges and functionality. The following list describes the differences between the three user levels:\n                       \n\n\n                         Admin users can\u00a0share items they create in the app with members of Domo Groups, and configure a default map and a default center.\n                        \n\n                         Standard users can\u00a0create their own items\u00a0and\u00a0see things that admin users share with them, but can't share items or set defaults.\n                        \n\n                         View-only users\u00a0can't create anything in the app. They can only view items that admin users share with them.\n                        \n\n\n                        To add admin and view-only users, a Domo admin must navigate to the Domo admin portal and create two Domo Groups:\u00a0_FlexMap_Admins and\u00a0_FlexMap_ViewOnly.\n                       \n\n                        Add a user to either group to give them admin or view-only privileges, or do not add the user to either group to give them standard user privileges.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Connecting Your Data to the App\n                       \n\n                        After you configure the required DataSets and user groups, you can deploy the app and connect your data.\n                       \n\n\n                         If you have access to the app card inside the\n                         \n                          Asset Library\n                         \n                         , deploy the app\u00a0to a dashboard in Domo and follow the numbered steps below.\n                        \n\n                         If the app card has been deployed for you with sample data, navigate to the app, then follow the numbered steps below.\n                        \n\n                       Follow these steps to connect your data to the app:\n                       \n\n                         Hover over the top right corner of the app\u00a0until\n                         \n\n                          Card options\n                         \n                         displays floating over the other map controls.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Select\n                         \n\n                          Card options\n                         \n                         >\n                         \n                          Edit Card\n                         \n                         .
