Customers use Splunk to search, monitor, analyze and visualize machine data.\n\nUse Domo's\n\nSplunk\n\nWriteback Connector to push data from a Domo DataSet to\n\nSplunk\n\n. To learn more about the\n\nSplunk\n\nAPI, visit their page (\n\nhttp://dev.splunk.com/restapi\n\n).\n\n\n You configure your Domo-\n\nSplunk\n\nconnection in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nSplunk\n\nWriteback Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this Connector, you must have the following:\n\n Your Domo Developer account credentials (client ID and client Secret)\n* Your host name\n* Your port number\n* Your HTTP\n\nevent collector token\n\n\n#####\n To obtain your Domo developer credentials, do the following:\n\n\n1. Log into the\n\nDomo developer account\n\n.\n2. In the top right corner under\n **My Account**\n click\n **New Client**\n .\n3. Enter the application name and description.\n4. Provide the application scope by selecting the checkboxes for\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n\nOnce you have created a client, you can manage the client by clicking on\n **Manage Client**\n .\n\n\n Configuring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nSplunk\n\nWriteback Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo developer account as well as the\n\nSplunk\n\naccount where you want your data to be copied to. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.\n  |\n|\n Splunk Host Name\n  |\n\nEnter your host name.\n\n\n**Note**\n\n- Do not include\n\n*https://**\n\nor\n\n*http://**\n\n.\n\n\n Example: \"\n\nsubdomain.domain.info\n\n\"\n\n|\n|\n Port\n  |\n\nEnter the port number.\n\n|\n|\n HTTP Event Collector Token\n  |\n\nEnter the event collector token.\n\n|\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new\n\nSplunk\n\nWriteback DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Splunk Index Name\n  |\n Enter your Splunk instance index name.\n  |\n|\n Source\n  |\n\nEnter the domo source name.\n\n*Example:**\n\n\n customername.domo.com\n\n\n |\n|\n Start Date Type\n  |\n Select the Start date selection type.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Select the start date from which you want to start fetching data.\n  |\n|\n Start Date Offset\n  |\n Select the number of days back from which you want to start fetching data. For example, Enter 0 for today.\n  |\n|\n End Date Type\n\n|\n Select the End date selection type.\n  |\n|\n End Date\n\n|\n Select the End Date.\n  |\n|\n End Date Offset\n\n|\n Select the number of days back till which you want to fetch data. For Example, enter 0 for today.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need your Domo Developer account credentials (client ID and client Secret), host name, port number, and HTTP event collector token.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDatasets should be set to update no more than once every 15 minutes.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n###\n What's the Source?\n\nYou need to provide the source location (in Domo) from where you want to fetch the activity logs for your user.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 5563069185815\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003992\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSplunk Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,710\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "splunk_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
