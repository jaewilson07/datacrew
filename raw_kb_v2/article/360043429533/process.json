Series in a Stream chart, if included, are centered. They do not share the same baseline and do not overlap. These charts also do not show value data except upon mouse-over. Therefore they are most effective for showing relative differences between stages rather than representing exact amounts.\n\n\n This chart type is exactly the same as a\n\nStream Funnel chart\n\n(classified in the Chart Picker as a Pie/Funnel chart rather than an Area chart) but is shown horizontally rather than vertically.\n\n\n The following example shows a Stream chart without series data:\n\nWhereas the next example shows the same chart with series data applied:\n\nPowering Stream Charts\n------------------------\n\nStream charts require two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a category column or row containing the names of each stage, and a value column or row containing the corresponding values for each stage. You can also add a column containing series data if you want. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Stream chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from the category, value, and series columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Stream chart:\n\nCustomizing Stream Charts\n---------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a Funnel chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . For information about all chart properties, see\n\nChart Properties\n\n.\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n General > Style\n  |\n Determines the style for a Stream chart, either\n **Curved**\n (default) or\n **Flat**\n . The example shows a Stream chart that uses the \"Flat\" style.\n  |  |\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043429533\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004677\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nStream Chart\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,769\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:20 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "stream_chart", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
