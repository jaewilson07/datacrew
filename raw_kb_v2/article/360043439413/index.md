In your

Profile

page, you can specify much of the personal information that appears in the profile header. The information you can specify here includes your name, position, department, landline number, cell number, company location, and tenure. Your employee number also appears here if one has been specified in the Admin Settings; however, you cannot edit it on this screen. You can only edit it in the
 **People**
 tab in the Admin Settings. For more information, see

Changing User Information

. Your email address does
 *not*
 appear here; however, if you click the

icon on a user's

Profile

page, your email client opens with the user's email address automatically entered in the
 **To**
 field.


 If you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Edit Users" enabled, you can specify or edit any other user's personal information on their personal

Profile

page. For example, if a user has just started at your company and you want to get them set up quickly, you could create a

Profile

page for them and populate it with their basic information.

For more information about default security roles, see

Managing Custom Roles

.

*To specify or edit an item of personal profile information,**

. Do one of the following:

* Open your

 Profile

 page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, a

 icon appears instead.)
	* Open another user's

 Profile

 page by clicking that user's profile picture anywhere that it appears.
2. Click in the area for the information you want to add or change.
3. Do one of the following:

* If you are specifying tenure, use the left and right arrow buttons at the top of the calendar to locate the desired start date, then click the start date to select it. You can also "zoom out" in the calendar to show a wider range by clicking the month or year in the top center of the calendar. For example, in the following screenshot, the user clicks on the month name, and the calendar zooms out to show all of the months in 2006. Clicking the left and right arrows would then scroll through years, rather than months. Clicking "2006" would zoom out again to show a 10-year range you could select from.

 Selecting a date updates the number of years in
 **Tenure**
 .
* If you are not specifying tenure, just enter the appropriate information.
