You can search for directions for several modes of transportation, including transit, driving, walking, or cycling. Directions may specify origins, destinations, and waypoints either as text strings (e.g.\n\nChicago, IL\n\nor\n\nDarwin, NT, Australia\n\n) or as latitude/longitude coordinates. The Directions API can return multi-part directions using a series of waypoints.\n\n\n You connect to Google Directions\u00a0account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Directions connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nNone\n\n\n Connecting to\u00a0Google Directions\n---------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Details**\n pane\u00a0in the Google Directions Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of options for specifying the data you want to retrieve into Domo.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Origin\n  |\n Enter the origin. This\u00a0can be a place name or latitude and longitude coordinates. Ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.\n  |\n|\n Destination\n  |\n Enter the destination. This\u00a0can be a place name or latitude and longitude coordinates. Ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.\n  |\n|\n Sensor\n  |\n Select\n **Yes**\n if the device has a location sensor.\n  |\n|\n Mode\n  |\n Select the travel mode you want to pull data for. If you select\n **Transit**\n , be sure to enter a time in either the\n **Departure Time**\n or\n **Arrival Time**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Alternatives\n  |\n Select whether you want your route to include alternate routes.\n  |\n|\n Waypoints (Optional)\n  |\n Enter waypoints you would like to appear in your route, separated by the pipe '|' character (for example:\n\nCharlestown,MA|Lexington,MA\n\n).\n  |\n|\n Avoid\n  |\n Select whether you want to avoid ferries, highways, or tolls in your route.
