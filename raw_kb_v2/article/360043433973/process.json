To learn more about Microsoft Exchange Server, visit their page (\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exc...xchserver-2019\n\n).\n\n\n To use this connector, you must first create a Microsoft Azure Web App and set the necessary permissions. This is discussed in the \"Prerequisites\" section below.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Exchange Metrics\u00a0REST account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Exchange Metrics\u00a0REST connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Exchange Metrics account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A customer client ID and client secret obtained from your Microsoft Azure Web App\n* Microsoft account credentials\n\n\n###\n Configuring Your Azure App\n\nTo create a connection with your Microsoft Exchange Metrics account, you must first create a Microsoft Azure Web App to obtain the necessary client ID and secret.\n\n\n**To configure an Azure App,**\n\n. Login into Azure Portal.\n2. Select\n **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > Create New Application**\n .\n3. In the\n **Name**\n field, enter the name of the application.\n4. In the\n **Application type**\n menu, select\n **Web app /API**\n .\n5. In the\n **Sign-on URL**\n , enter the sign-on URL of your application (\n\nwww.yourcompanyname.com\n\n).\n6. Click\n **Create**\n .\n7. Click on your application.\n\n\n The\n **Application ID**\n that appears here\u00a0is the Client ID you will enter in the\n **Connection**\n pane in Domo.\n8. **Select\u00a0Settings > Reply URLs.**\n9. Enter the following URL in the field\u00a0and click\n **Save**\n .\n\n\n`https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/microsoft-exchange-metrics-rest/exchange`\n10. Select\n **Settings > Required Permissions > Add > Microsoft Graph > Save**\n .\n11. Set the following permissions:\n\n* \"Maintain access to data you have given it access to\"\n\t* \"Read all usage reports\"\n\t* \"Read user and shared contacts\"\n\t* \"Read user and shared calendars\"\n\t* \"Read all files that user can access\"\n12. Select\n **Settings > Required Permissions > Add > Windows Azure Active Directory > Save**\n .\n13. Set the following permissions:\n\n* \"Sign in and read user profile\"\n\t* \"Read all users' basic profiles\"\n14. Select\n **Settings > Required Permissions > Grant Permissions > Yes**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nIn some cases, an Admin has to approve grant permissions; otherwise you will see a message reading \"Failed to grant permissions for application.\"\n15. Select\n **Settings > Keys > Create New Key**\n .\n\n\n This is the Client Secret\u00a0you will enter in the\n **Connection**\n pane in Domo. Be sure to save this, as you will not see it again.\n\nConnecting to Your Microsoft Exchange Metrics Account\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Microsoft Exchange Metrics Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Microsoft Exchange Metrics account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Microsoft Exchange Metrics client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Microsoft Exchange Metrics client secret.\n  |\n\n\n After you enter a\u00a0client ID and client secret, you are taken to Microsoft's OAuth page where you are requested to enter your email, phone number, or Skype name associated with your Microsoft account.\u00a0Once you have connected, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Microsoft Exchange Metrics DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n****Note:****\n If you are already logged into Microsoft when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n ****Add account****\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Microsoft.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n
