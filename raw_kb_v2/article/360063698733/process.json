It uses a SQL script-based transformation interface, similar to MySQL DataFlows. Adrenaline DataFlows allow you to rapidly summarize and aggregate massive DataSets into smaller, more performant outputs. Adrenaline DataFlows are able to deliver high-performance by leveraging architectural investments and performance improvements made to Domo's Adrenaline engine over time.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             This feature is available\n                             \n                              on demand and paid.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n                            To\u00a0request this feature be enabled,\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                               Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager, Technical Consultant, or Account Executive.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               If you do not have contact information for your CSM, TC, or AE, contact Technical Support.

We recommend Adrenaline DataFlows for the following use cases:\n                       \n\n                        1. Building high-performance Dashboards from massive DataSets. Instead of directly building cards off such large DataSets, we recommend using Adrenaline DataFlows to create summarized and aggregated smaller outputs which should then be used to power fast, high-performance dashboards. For cases where access to the full data is needed, we recommend setting up Drill Paths to the original DataSet from the visualizations built from the summarized DataFlow outputs.\n                       \n\n                        2. Data transformations that require scanning the entire length of massive DataSets e.g., COUNT DISTINCT, SUM, and other aggregate operations.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Domo does not recommend using Adrenaline DataFlows for doing row-by-row transformations, where DataFlow outputs have similar row counts as input DataSets.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating an Adrenaline DataFlow\n                       \n\n                        1.
