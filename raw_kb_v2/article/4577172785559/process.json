This article discusses how to configure various administrative features.\n\n\n Actions in this article can only be executed by Admin users or those with the Manage All Goals grant enabled. For more information, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n\n Managing General Settings\n----------------------------\n\n\n Admins can specify general settings for Domo Goals. This includes choosing nomenclature, creating time periods for goals, and setting the check-in cadence.\n\n\n####\n\nConfiguring Goals Nomenclature\n\n\n 1. In the navigation header, go to\n **More > Admin**\n .\n\n\n 2. From the\n **Features**\n section, select\n **Goals**\n .\n\n\n 3. In\n **General**\n tab, select an option from the\n **Goals Nomenclature**\n menu.\n\n\n Several choices display allowing you to determine if your organization will use Goals and Metrics, Objectives and Key Results, Objectives and KPIs, or Priorities and Action Items. Your choice of terminology will not affect the Goals functionality.\n\n4. Select\n **Save**\n .\n\n\n The Goals feature now uses\u00a0your organization's chosen nomenclature.\n\n\n####\n\nConfiguring Goals Time Periods\n\nIn Domo Goals, you use time periods to determine when a goal should be completed. These generally correspond to your company\u2019s fiscal quarters, months, or years (depending on how often you expect people to create new goals). The\n **Name**\n is what the people will see when selecting the time period during the goal creation process.\n\n*Important:**\n You\n\n\n will NOT be able to create any goals until time periods are created.\n\n\n 1. In the navigation header, go to\n **More > Admin**\n .\n\n\n 2. From the\n **Features**\n section, select\n **Goals**\n .\n\n\n 3.

Give the time period a\n **Name**\n ,\n\n\n and select T\n **ime period start and end dates**\n .\n\n\n 5. Select\n **Save**\n .\n\n6.

(Conditional) Select the day and time you wish the weekly goals check-in reminder email to be sent to all people who have active goals.\n\nWeekly reminders send at the specified time.
