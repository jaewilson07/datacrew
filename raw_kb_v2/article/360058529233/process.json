The drill-ability is determined by your data, but you should be able to click into an individual campus and see only the cohorts within that location.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             This app\u00a0is part of the\n                             \n                              Get Back to Work Solution\n                             \n                             and is\u00a0available\n                             \n                              on-demand and paid\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            To request this feature be enabled,\n                           \n\n\n\n                              Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager\u00a0or Account Executive.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n                               If you do not have contact information for your CSM or AE, contact Domo Support.

The map is dynamic and can be drilled down to a selected location and can be as granular as\u00a0desired.

The left-side bar will filter down according to the individual location you've selected from the map. Select the filter button while in Active incidents so see those assigned to you. See the number of people potentially exposed and those that have been notified from that incident. Orange incidents indicate a Failed Safe Worker or Temperature Scanning check-in or Potentially Exposed case. Red incidents indicate a Confirmed Incident. The filter icon can be used to filter to incidents assigned to you.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Manually created Incidents\n                       \n\n                        Incidents can be manually created by selected the\n                        \n                         +\n                        \n                        icon from the left-side panel. Manual Incidents are created when someone has not failed a check-in but has instead been reported as being in contact with someone else with symptoms or contacted HR. When an Incident has been opened, it remains open until the Incident has been addressed by an authorized member of the organization. This prevents people from entering the office until they've been cleared. Choose an employee, select the individual type (Employee or Guest), select the Flagged Reason (Failed Check In - Entrance Assessment, Failed Check In - Safe Worker, Potential Incident, and Confirmed Incident), and choose the incident date.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Templates\n                       \n\n                        Create a new notification Template by selecting the gear icon from the left-side panel.

The individual's Incident is shown as a red dot on the map, and anyone they've come in contact with (by location) will appear in yellow. The timeline at the bottom of the screen allows you to scrub across a 14-day range to see who the individual has come in contact with. The Incident Subject will appear in the left-side bar as either orange or red, depending upon their Flagged Reason type and any potentially exposed individuals will appear as yellow.
