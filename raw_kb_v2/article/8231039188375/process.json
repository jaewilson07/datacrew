Use the Aurora MySQL connector to efficiently and securely bring in data from your database. Once your data is in Domo, you can give managers and stakeholders transparency with real-time, interactive dashboards. Set up alerts to be notified of changes in your key data points. And you can access all your data in real-time, from any device.\n\nDomo's\n\nAurora\n\nConnector\n\nis an open-source database.\n\nTo learn more about the Amazon Aura connector\n\n\n API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/\n\n).\n\n\n The Aurora\n\n\n Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n\n\n**Cloud App**\n\n\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nAmazon Aura\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nAmazon Aura\n\nConnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Amazon Aurora account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password\u00a0you use to log into your database\n* The hostname or IP address of your database server\n* The port number for\u00a0your database\n* The database name or schema name\n\nYou can also include the URL where your SSL CA Certificate is located, though this is optional.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nAura\n\nAccount\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the Aura Connector page. The components of the other panes on this page,\n\n\n**Scheduling,**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\n\nAurora\n\nConnector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n\n\n**Connect**\n\n\n (or select\n\n\n**Add Account**\n\n\n if you have existing\n\nAurora database\n\naccounts in Domo) to open the\n\nAurora\n\nOAuth screen where you can enter your\n\nAurora database\n\nusername and password. Once you have entered valid\n\nAurora database\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nAurora connector\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n\n**Accounts**\n\n\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\nThe following Credential table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your database username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your database password.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the hostname or IP address of your database server. Example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n|\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for your database server.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter your database name.\n  |\n|\n CA Certificate\u00a0(optional)\n  |\n Enter the URL where the SSL CA Certificate is located.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nAmazon Aurora\u00a0Partition\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n\n**Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n**Note:**\n\nIf you are already logged into\n\n\n Aurora connector\n\n\n when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n\n*Add account**\n\n. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of\n\n\n the Aurora connector\n\n\n .\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis page contains a primary\n\n\n**Reports**\n\n\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the Structured Query Language (SQL) query to use in selecting the data you want. For example:\n\nselect \\* from Employee\n\nYou can use the\n **Query Helper**\n parameter to help you write a usable SQL query. To use the\n **Query Helper**\n , do the following:\n 1. Select your database table\u00a0and table columns in the appropriate menus.\n2. Copy the SQL statement that appears in the\n **Query Helper**\n field.\n3. Paste the copied SQL statement into the\n **Query**\n field.\n |\n|\n Query Type\n  |\n Select the desired MySQL query type\u2014either with or without a parameter.\n  |\n|\n Query Parameter\n\n|\n Enter the query parameter value. This is the initial value for the query parameter. You can use this option to retrieve new data since the last run.\n\n\n For example, if you entered the following query in the\n **Query**\n field...\n\n\n`select * from test.lastValue where id <= !{lastvalue:id}! order by id desc`\n\n\n ...and then entered the following for the\n **Query Parameter**\n ...\n\n\n`!{lastvalue:id}!=3`\n\n\n ...then the first run would return 3 rows, and all subsequent runs would return 1 row, and the results would be ordered from largest to smallest.\n\n\n Similarly, if you entered the following in the\n\n\n**Query**\n field...\n\n\n`select * from test.lastValue where time > !{lastrundate:time}!`\n\n\n ...and then entered the following for the\n **Query Parameter**\n ...\n\n\n`!{lastrundate:time}!=01/01/1990`\n\n\n ...then the first run would return 5 rows and all subsequent runs would return 0 rows.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to get data for. Value can be a positive integer. For example 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default,\n\n\n********yyyy-MM-dd********\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n TinyInt Values Treated as Bit (Boolean) Values\n  |\n Select Yes if you want the tiny integer\u00a0values to be treated as boolean\u00a0values, else select No.\n  |\n|\n Cast Boolean Values To...\n  |\n Select whether the String or Integer boolean values will be cast within your dataset.\n\nString: False/True\n\nInteger: 0/1\n  |\n|\n Database Table (Optional)\n  |\n Select the database table you want to import into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Table Columns (Optional)\n  |\n\nSelect the table columns you want to import into Domo.\n\n|\n|\n Query Helper (Optional)\n  |\n\nCopy and paste the SQL statement in this field into the\n **Query**\n field. For more information, see\n **Query**\n , above.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the Connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n FAQs\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the username, password, hostname or IP address, port number, and database name associated with your database. You can also include the URL where your SSL CA certificate is located, though it is optional.\n\n###\n How to get a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate?\n\nTo get a certificate bundle that contains both the intermediate and root certificates for all AWS Regions, download from\n\n\n https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem\n\n\n .\n\n\n If your application is on Microsoft Windows and requires a PKCS7 file, you can download the PKCS7 certificate bundle. This bundle contains both the intermediate and root certificates at\n\n\n https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.p7b\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n\n\n Amazon RDS Proxy\u00a0and Aurora Serverless use\u00a0certificates from the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). If you are using RDS Proxy, you don't need to download Amazon RDS certificates or update applications that use RDS Proxy connections. For more information about using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy, see\n\nUsing TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy\n\n.\n\nIf you are Aurora Serverless, downloading Amazon RDS certificates isn't required. For more information about using TLS/SSL with Aurora Serverless, see\n\nUsing TLS/SSL with Aurora Serverless v1\n\n.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nLimits depend on your server configuration.\n\n###\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nDatasets can run as often as every 15 minutes. However, depending on the runtime of the query, datasets may need to run less frequently.\n\n###\n What do I need to be aware of while writing a query?\n\nMake sure that all the words, table names, and field names are correctly spelled.\n\n###\n Why can't I connect to my database? Do I need to whitelist any IP addresses?\n\nBefore you can connect to your database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the port you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see Whitelisting IP Addresses.\n\n###\n What's the difference between the Amazon Aurora and Amazon Aurora Partition connectors?\n\nIn the Amazon Aurora connector, you need to select a JDBC driver to connect to your database. The Amazon Aurora connector gives you a choice to write an SQL query with or without the query parameter. It allows you to select the database table and table columns. It also provides a Query Helper to guide you in writing an SQL query.\n\n\n The Amazon Aurora Partition connector supports partitioning, thus optimizing your database performance. You need to select the table name and partition column name. You also need to specify the number of past days you want to get data for. It gives you a choice if you want your TinyInt values to be treated as String or Integer, though it's optional. You can select the Date format for your data to be retrieved.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 8231039188375\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003832\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAurora Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,421\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "aurora_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
