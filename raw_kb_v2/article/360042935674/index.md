Requirements
--------------


* Anyone can use CourseBuilder. However, if you intend to publish a CourseBuilder app to Domo, you must have Editor-, Privileged-, or Admin-level rights.
* Apps produced by CourseBuilder are not fully optimized for the mobile experience. We recommend that you inform all users of your apps to try to access these from a desktop/laptop device if possible.
* The apps produced by CourseBuilder are optimized for the Google Chrome browser. We recommend avoiding the use of Internet Explorer when viewing CourseBuilder apps.
* Apps uploaded to Domo should not exceed 100 MB in size, as this will diminish the ability of the browser to render the app in a timely manner.
