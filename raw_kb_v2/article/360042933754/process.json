Example:\n                           \n\n                             my.column.name\n                            \n\n                           .

If the Group does not exist, the app runs but no users can make changes to it.\n                       \n\n                        To learn about Domo Groups, see\n                        \n                         Creating and Managing User Groups\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Known Limitations\n                       \n\n                        The following are known limitations in the current version of the app:\n                       \n\n\n                         Standard DataSets are limited to 100,000 rows and/or 500 columns. If you need to use a larger DataSet, first convert it to an upsert DataSet. Learn how to do this in the\n                         \n                          Inline Editing Implementation Guide.\n                         \n\n\n                         If a mechanism external to the app is in place and modifies the data in the DataSet, such as a DataFlow, the changes written from the app are overwritten by the mechanism.\n                        \n\n                         The app checks for changes to the DataSet every few seconds. If multiple people are actively using the app, and one of them commits changes, the app warns the other users of the action and their changes must be dropped to continue using the app.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Upsert DataSets\n                       \n\n                        You can configure Inline Editing to use any DataSet in Domo. However, when changes are written back to the DataSet, there are two ways of sending the changes, described below.\n                       \n\n\n                         In a standard, default DataSet, the app must download the entire DataSet (in sections), apply the changes to the target rows, and re-upload the modified DataSet. This process can potentially take a long time, depending on the size of the DataSet.\n                        \n\n                         In an upsert DataSet, changes are only sent for the rows that are being modified, added, or deleted, using the values in the key columns. Because of the\u00a0shorter potential writeback time, you may consider converting your DataSets to upsert DataSets. To learn how, see the\n                         \n                          Inline Editing Implementation Guide\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Page Filters Setup\n                       \n\n                        Inline Editing provides an in-app way to filter the data. However, the Filters applied to the Domo dashboard where the app card is placed can also be read and used by the app.\n                       \n\n                        In order for the columns used in the\u00a0DataSets in the app to be available as Page Filters, these DataSets must be mapped properly. To learn how to do this, see\n                        \n                         Mapping DataSets to the App\n                        \n                        , below. The app allows for up to 30 DataSets (in 30 tabs) to exist at the same time.\n                       \n\n                        Whenever you add a tab, you must map the DataSet in that tab.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note the following:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Each DataSet can only be linked to one tab. After it is linked, you cannot add a second tab pointing to the same DataSet.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               If you remove a tab, you do not necessarily need to remove the DataSet from the mapping. Doing so, however, cleans up the list of Filters and keeps a cleaner list of mapped DataSets.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Mapping DataSets to the App\n                       \n\n                        Follow these steps to map DataSets to the app:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                         Hover over the app to display\n                         \n\n                          Card options\n                         \n                         in the top right corner, and select it.\n                         \n                         The card options display.\n                        \n\n                         Select\n                         \n\n                          Edit Card.\n                         \n\n                         The card editor displays.\n                        \n\n                         (Optional) Check the box for\n                         \n                          Fullpage\n                         \n                         if you want to see the full page of the app as you edit.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         At the\u00a0bottom of the card editor, the\u00a0data\n                         \n                          Mapping\n                         \n                         area displays.
