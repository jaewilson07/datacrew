To learn more about the Workiva API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://success.workiva.com/developers/api-reference\n\n).\n\n\n You export data from Domo to Workiva in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Workiva\u00a0Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you must have a\u00a0Domo Client ID and Client Secret. To obtain these credentials, do the following:\n\n. Log into your Domo developer account at\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/login\n\n.\n2. Create a new client\n\n.\n3. Select the desired data and user application scope.\n4. Click\n ********Create********\n .\n\nYou must also have the following:\n\n A Workiva client ID\n* A Workiva client secret\n\nTo learn how to obtain these credentials, see\n\nhttps://success.workiva.com/developers/guides/setup\n\n.\n\n\n Configuring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Workiva\u00a0Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Workiva account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Workiva client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Workiva client secret.\n  |\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\nOnce you have entered valid Workiva credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Workiva DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to Workiva. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Spreadsheet ID\n  |\n Enter the ID of the Workiva spreadsheet where you want to send your Domo data. This can be found in the spreadsheet URL. For example, in the URL\n\n\n https://app\n\n.\n\nwdesk.com/a/aabbccddeeffgghhkkllXTest/spreadsheet/aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee\n\n\n , the ID is\n\naaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Sheet ID\n  |\n Select the specific sheet where you want to send your Domo data.\n  |\n|\n Region\n  |\n Enter the region of the spreadsheet where you want to send your Domo data. Formatting guidelines are as follows:\n\n\n|\n If you were to enter this...\n  |\n ...your Domo data would end up here\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nA1\n\n|\n Cell A1\n  |\n|\n\nA2:D8\n\n|\n All cells in the range between A2 and D8 (inclusive)\n  |\n|\n\nA:A\n\n|\n All cells in column A\n  |\n|\n\n1:3\n\n|\n All cells in rows 1 through 3\n  |\n|\n\nB3:\n\n|\n All cells below and to the right of B3 (inclusive)\n  |\n|\n\n:\n\n|\n All cells in the sheet\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932534\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004021\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nWorkiva Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,378\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:18 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "workiva_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
