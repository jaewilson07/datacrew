The region that displays for a DataSet is \"zoomed\" in or out depending on the given coordinates. For example, if all of the cities in your DataSet were in Germany, the resulting map would show Germany; likewise, if some cities in the DataSet were in Germany and others were in France, the map would be \"zoomed out\" to show western Europe. Filters you apply to a latitude/longitude map also work this way. For example, if you were in the Details view for a map of the United States and you used Analyzer to show only cities in Washington and California, your map would be updated to show the westmost region of the United States. For more information about applying filters, see\n                        \n                         Adding Filters to Your Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        This type of map is almost the same as the\n                        \n                         latitude-longitude route map\n                        \n                        . The difference is that points in a latitude-longitude route map are connected to form routes. These maps are more complex than standard latitude-longitude maps, requiring seven columns or rows of data.\n                       \n\n                        For information about world maps, see\n                        \n                         U.S. County Map\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        For information about troubleshooting when an area in your map does not show data but there is data, see\n                        \n                         Troubleshooting\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         Video - Map Charts\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Understanding latitude-longitude maps\n                       \n\n                        Latitude-longitude maps require four data columns or rows from your DataSet, though you can add an optional fifth column for series data if you want. One column or row contains the latitudes of the points you want to plot, one contains the longitudes, one contains the values that correspond with each latitude-longitude pairing, and one contains text for the hover label that appears for each point. Maps also include permanent data labels for specific cities. These are\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        determined by your DataSet\u2014they are included automatically based on the region. For this reason, it is possible your map may include points that do not have data labels. However, all points have hover text.\n                       \n\n                        Values are represented in your map by varying point sizes, each size of which corresponds to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet and are represented by a legend, which is automatically included beside the map.\n                       \n\n                        If you want, you can add an optional fifth column that contains series data, which is represented in the map by varying colors of map points. For example, if the cities in your DataSet were broken down into two different classes, \"A\" and \"B,\" the points within class \"A\" would appear orange by default, and the points within class \"B\" would appear blue. The sums for each series are shown in the map legend. If a user clicks on a point in a latitude-longitude map with series data, the drill table that appears shows all items for that series in the map.

For example, if you had a latitude-longitude map showing values per state and you added the same map as a drill layer, clicking any point in the country-level map would bring up a \"zoomed in\" state or region level that displayed all of the original data points from that state or region.\n                       \n\n                        Results from using this technique vary depending on the map type, your DataSet, and the specific columns you apply.\n                       \n\n                        For more information about adding drill layers to a chart, see\n                        \n                         Adding Drill Path to Your Chart\n                        \n                        .", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360043429213", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
