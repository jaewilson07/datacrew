Each hierarchical level is represented as a ring. The innermost ring represents the top level of the hierarchy, and each progressive ring outward from the center represents a level down from the top level, with smaller segments representing a portion of their parent in the hierarchy. The relative size of any segment represents the value of\u00a0that segment. You can include up to 5 rings in any Sunburst chart.\n                       \n\n                        In the following example, which shows the hierarchy of an organization's top customers, the innermost ring displays the three customer regions\u2014Americas, APAC, and Emea. Each of these is divided into its constituent classes (A, B, or C) in the second ring. Finally, the third ring shows the customers for each region and class combination.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Powering Sunburst Charts\n                       \n\n                        This type of chart requires at least three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a value column to determine the size of each segment in the chart, and at least two category columns to be represented as rings. You can apply up to five\u00a0category columns for a total of five\u00a0rings. Rings appear in your chart in the order that they are applied in the Analyzer. So if you were to drag the \"Region\" column into the\n                        \n                         Category 1\n                        \n                        field, that category would be represented as the innermost ring; dragging \"Customer\" into the\n                        \n                         Category 2\n                        \n                        field would cause it to be represented as the second ring; and so on.
