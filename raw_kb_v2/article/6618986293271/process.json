Use this connector to get data about classes, clients, payments, transactions and more for the tight and toned analysis.\n\n\n Once the data is in Domo, you can combine it with other data from across your organization. Use Domo to track and monitor how the data changes over time, and create customizable reports to tell compelling stories behind the data. Within just a few minutes you\u2019ll be able to quickly and easily create powerful visualizations that identify key metrics to track.\u00a0 To learn more about the MINDBODY API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.mindbodyonline.com/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your MINDBODY account in the Data Center.
