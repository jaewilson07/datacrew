At least one input DataSet is required, but you can include as many as you need. One output DataSet is required at the end of a DataFlow; this is the DataSet you can then use to power Domo Cards and Apps.\n\n*Important:**\n There are significant behavioral differences in Magic ETL. Read our article about\n\nBehavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL\n\nbefore converting mission-critical Magic ETL DataFlows.\n **Failure to do so may result in an unintended change to the behavior of your DataFlow.**\n\nFor information about creating a Magic ETL DataFlow, see\n\nCreating a Magic ETL DataFlow\n\n.\n\n\n For information about the Data Center, see\n\nData Center Layout\n\n.\n\n\n**Important:**\n Input DataSets\u00a0in a DataFlow\u00a0cannot be restricted by PDP policies\u2014all available rows\n *must*\n pass through the DataFlow. Because of this, you must apply PDP policies to the output DataSets generated by a DataFlow.\n\n\n When you build a DataFlow using an input DataSet\u00a0with PDP\u00a0policies in place,\u00a0the DataFlow breaks unless\u00a0at least one of the following criteria\u00a0applies:\n\n You have an Admin security profile or a custom role with the Manage DataFlows grant.\n* You are\u00a0the DataSet owner.\n* You are\u00a0part of the \"All Rows\" policy. This gives you access to all of the rows in the DataSet.\n\nFor more information about using PDP with DataFlows, see\n\nPDP and DataFlows/DataFusions\n\n.\n\n\n This article describes DataSets tiles in Magic ETL DataFlows in the following topics:\n * Input DataSet tile\n* Configuring input DataSet tiles\n* Input DataSet details\n* Output DataSet tile\n* Configuring output DataSet tiles\n* Output DataSet details\n* Writeback tile\n* Configuring writeback tiles\n* Writeback tile\u00a0details\n\nInput DataSet Tile\n----------------------\n\n\n You can use the Input DataSet tile to add a DataSet to the DataFlow. There\n *must*\n be at least one input DataSet in a DataFlow.\n\n\n After adding a DataSet, select the\n **Data**\n tab to preview a\u00a0table of the input data.\n\n*Note:**\n The maximum number of columns allowed in Magic ETL is 1500 columns.\n\n\n Virtual DataSets are different from Federated DataSets and are treated differently in Magic ETL. Virtual DataSets are accepted as inputs to Magic ETL, but Federated DataSets are not.\n ###\n\n\n Configuring Input DataSet Tiles\n\nFollow these steps to configure an Input DataSet tile:\n\n. Select the\n **Input DataSet**\n tile, then select the DataSet you want to transform. You can select an existing DataSet or select\n **Create New**\n to create a new\u00a0DataSet to use.\n2. Set the\n **Data Selection**\n to either\n **Entire DataSet**\n (default), which will use all of the rows in the DataSet, or\n **Only new rows**\n , which will process\u00a0only the new rows added to the DataSet (this must be done on a DataSet\u00a0set to Append,\u00a0not Replace).\n3. Set the column data types in the\n **Select Data Type**\n menu next to each column Data Type. This prevents any schema changes made to the input data\u00a0from breaking your DataFlow.\n4. Select\n\n*Settings**\n and set the\n **Special Handling**\n for each column. This allows you to specify the\n **Parsing**\n of the data (only for Number\u00a0and Date columns) and handling of\n **Bad values**\n and\n **Null values**\n in your column.\n\n##\n\n\n Input DataSet Details\n\nUnder the\n **Details**\n tab of the input tile, you can view the DataSet's:\n\n Name\n* Owner\n* Number of cards\n* Number of views\n* Number of rows\n* Date of last update\n* Date of next update\n* Column names and types\n\nOutput DataSet Tile\n-----------------------\n\n\n You can use the Output DataSet tile to output the transformed data as a DataSet.\u00a0You can use this new DataSet to power up cards (or other DataFlows).\n\n\n There\n *must*\n be an output DataSet in a DataFlow.\n\n*Note:**\n Based on scheduled run settings, whenever the specified input DataSet changes, the Magic ETL DataFlow performs the transform and updates the output DataSet.\u00a0For information about scheduling a Magic ETL DataFlow, see\n\nScheduling a Magic ETL DataFlow\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\n\n Configuring Output DataSet Tiles\n\nFollow these steps to configure an Output DataSet tile:\n\n. Make sure that a tile\u00a0is connected to the\n **Output DataSet**\n tile and that all tiles\u00a0are connected and configured in the transformation flow.\n2. Select the\n **Output DataSet**\n tile, and then specify the name of the DataSet you want to output by selecting\n\n*Edit**\n and entering a name and a description.\n3. (Optional) Select the\n **Additional Options**\n menu and select\n **Update Method**\n to either\n **Replace data**\n (default) or\n **Append data**\n .\n\n\n**Tip:**\n You can preview the data in the output DataSet by running a preview, selecting the\n **Output DataSet**\n tile, and then selecting the\n **Preview**\n tab\n\n.\n\n##\n\n\n Output DataSet Details\n\nIf the DataFlow has not yet run, the details available are the\u00a0owner, column names, and column types. After\u00a0it has run successfully, you can view all of the same\n\ndetails for an input tile\n\n.\n\n\n Writeback Tile\n------------------\n\n\n You can use the Writeback\u00a0tile to output the transformed data as a DataSet and send the data back to another system.\n\n##\n\n\n Configuring Writeback Tiles\n\nFollow these steps to configure a Writeback\u00a0tile:\n\n. Make sure that a tile\u00a0is connected to the\n **Writeback**\n tile and that all tiles are connected and configured in the transformation flow.\n2. Select the\n **Writeback**\n tile, and then specify the name of the DataSet you want to output by selecting\n\n*Edit**\n and entering a name and a description.\n3. (Optional) Select the\n **Additional Options**\n menu and select\n **Update Method**\n to either replace (default) or append data.\n4. Select\n **Configure Writeback**\n , then\u00a0select the Writeback\u00a0Connector you want to use.\n\n\n###\n\n\n Writeback Tile Details\n\nIf the DataFlow has not yet run, the details available are the\u00a0owner, column names, and column types. After it has run successfully, you can view all of the same\n\ndetails for an input tile\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360045402273\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003001\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMagic ETL Tiles: DataSets\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 6,322\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 8:59 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "magic_etl_tiles_datasets", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "magic_etl", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanvGAC"}, {"text": "tiles", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZdTHGA0"}]}
