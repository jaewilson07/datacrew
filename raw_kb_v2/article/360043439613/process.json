For a list of deprecated properties, see\n                          \n                           Deprecated Chart Properties\n                          \n                          . Note that for any deprecated checkbox-activated properties, if that property was set to \"on\" before the property was deprecated, the property still appears in your Chart Properties and is still set to \"on.\" However, if you then turn off the property and resave the chart, the deprecated property will no longer be available.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Numbers to the right of property categories indicate the number of enabled properties within that category. For example, in the following screenshot, one property has been set for\n                          \n                           General\n                          \n                          , two for\n                          \n                           Bar Settings\n                          \n                          , and so on.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Chart properties that only apply when certain other properties are applied are now grayed out when those properties are not applied.
