Partitioning enables the table data to be divided across multiple storage objects (data partitions), according to the values in one or more table columns based on a set of user-defined rules. Use Domo\u2019s MySQL Partition connector to optimize the way the database engine physically stores data.\n\n\n You connect to your MySQL Partition account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the MySQL Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Notes:**\n\n\n* This connector supports TLS IF your MySQL server supports TLS.\n* Non SSL connections are not supported. If no certificate is provided, the connection is still SSL but without any certificate authentication. The connection will trust all server certificates. Refer to the following\u00a0link for details :\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb879949%28v=sql.110%29.aspx\n\n\n Prerequisites\n\nTo connect to your MySQL Partition account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your MySQL database.\n* The host name for the database.\n* The port number for the database.\n* The database name or schema name.\n* SSL\n* You can also include the URL where your SSL CA Certificate is located, though this is optional.\n\nBefore you can connect to a MySQL\u00a0database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your MySQL Partition Account\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nMySQL Partition\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nMySQL Partition\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n JDBC Driver\n  |\n Select the JDBC driver to use to connect to the database server.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the MySQL database. For example:\n\ndb.company.com\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the MySQL database or schema.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your MySQL username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your MySQL password.\n  |\n|\n CA Certificate\n  |\n Enter the URL where the SSL CA Certificate is located (optional).\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nMySQL Partition\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you specify the attributes and conditions\u00a0to partition\u00a0your data.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute.\n  |\n|\n Table Name\n  |\n Select the database table.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to get data for. Value can be a positive integer. For example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ****yyyy-MM-dd****\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Select if you want to compress the data\n  |\n Choose the way you want the data to be uploaded. Select True, if you want the data to be compressed while uploading, else select False.\n  |\n|\n Tinyint values treated as (bit) boolean values\n  |\n Select Yes if you want the tiny integer\u00a0values to be treated as boolean\u00a0values, else select No.\n  |\n|\n Cast Boolean Values to...\n  |\n Select whether the String or Integer boolean values will be cast to within your dataset.\n\nString: False/True\n\nInteger: 0/1\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360056826694\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003974\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMySQL Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,742\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mysql_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
