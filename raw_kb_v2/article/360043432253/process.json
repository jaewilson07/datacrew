To learn more about the Outreach API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.outreach.io/product/platform#api\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Outreach account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Outreach connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Outreach account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password associated with your Outreach account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Outreach Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Outreach Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Outreach\u00a0connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Outreach accounts in Domo) to open the Outreach OAuth screen where you can enter your Outreach\u00a0username and password. Once you have entered valid Outreach\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Outreach DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Outreach when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Outreach.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Outreach report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Accounts\n  |\n\nRetrieves details about accounts used to categorize prospects.\n\n|\n|\n Audits\n  |\n\nRetrieves details about audit events that happen during the day.

If you choose\n **Specific**\n , the report will always pull data for the selected date whenever it runs. If you choose\n **Relative**\n , the report will pull data for the entered number of back days whenever it runs. For example, if you selected\n **Relative**\n and entered\n\n7\n\nfor the number of days back, each time the report ran it would pull data for the last 7 days.\n  |\n|\n Specific Date\n  |\n Select the specific date you want to pull data for.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.

Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n FAQ\n\n\n####\n What version of the Outreach API does this connector use?\n\nThis connector uses version 2 of the Outreach API (\n\nhttps://api.outreach.io/api/v2\n\n).\n\n###\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint URL(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Accounts\n  |\n /accounts\n  |\n|\n Audits\n  |\n /audits\n  |\n|\n Call Dispositions\n  |\n /callDispositions\n  |\n|\n Call Purposes\n  |\n /callPurposes\n  |\n|\n Calls\n  |\n /calls\n  |\n|\n Content Category Membership\n  |\n /contentCategoryMemberships\n  |\n|\n Content Category Ownership\n  |\n /contentCategoryOwnerships\n  |\n|\n Content Category\n  |\n /contentCategories\n  |\n|\n Custom Duties\n  |\n /customDuties\n  |\n|\n Duty\n  |\n /duties\n  |\n|\n Email Address\n  |\n /emailAddresses\n  |\n|\n Event\n  |\n /events\n  |\n|\n Favorite\n  |\n /favorites\n  |\n|\n Mail Alias\n  |\n /mailAliases\n  |\n|\n Mailbox\n  |\n /mailboxes\n  |\n|\n Mailings\n  |\n /mailings\n  |\n|\n Messenger Conversation\n  |\n /messengerConversations\n  |\n|\n Messenger Message\n  |\n /messengerMessages\n  |\n|\n Opportunities\n  |\n /opportunities\n  |\n|\n Opportunity Prospect Role\n  |\n /opportunityProspectRoles\n  |\n|\n Opportunity Stage\n  |\n /opportunityStages\n  |\n|\n Personas\n  |\n /personas\n  |\n|\n Phone Number\n  |\n /phoneNumbers\n  |\n|\n Profile\n  |\n /profiles\n  |\n|\n Prospects\n  |\n /prospects\n  |\n|\n Recipient\n  |\n /recipients\n  |\n|\n Role\n  |\n /roles\n  |\n|\n Rulesets\n  |\n /rulesets\n  |\n|\n Sequence States\n  |\n /sequenceStates\n  |\n|\n Sequence Steps\n  |\n /sequenceSteps\n  |\n|\n Sequence Template\n  |\n /sequenceTemplates\n  |\n|\n Sequences\n  |\n /sequences\n  |\n|\n Snippet\n  |\n /snippets\n  |\n|\n Stages\n  |\n /stages\n  |\n|\n Task Priority\n  |\n /taskPriorities\n  |\n|\n Tasks\n  |\n /tasks\n  |\n|\n Team\n  |\n /teams\n  |\n|\n Template\n  |\n /templates\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n /users\n  |\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the email address and password of your Outreach account.\n\n###\n Why am I getting an error after entering the correct credentials in the OAuth login window?\n\nOutreach has previously had a known issue with their OAuth popup window. This requires you to login into Outreach in a separate tab, then create a Domo Outreach account. For the step-by-step instructions for obtaining a client id, see Outreach\n\nOAuth Documentation.\n\nRedirect URL:\n\nhttps://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/outreach\n\n.\n\n###\n How do I know my Outreach account credentials are secure?\n\nDomo's Outreach connector uses OAuth, which authenticates the account without Domo ever having access to your Outreach account credentials.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nThe Outreach API is rate limited on a per-user basis, with a fixed limit of 5,000 requests per one hour period.\n\n###\n When I click 'Add Account', why am I getting automatically validated without needing to enter credentials?\n\nIf you are already logged into Outreach when you connect to Domo, you are authenticated automatically as you click Add Account. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Outreach.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043432253\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003673\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nOutreach Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,429\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "outreach_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
