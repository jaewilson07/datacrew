The connector provides access to company details, shared posts, share statistics, user profile information, and video analytics.\u00a0To learn more about the\u00a0LinkedIn API, visit their site (\n\nhttps://developer.linkedin.com\n\n).\n\n\n The LinkedIn connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n**Important:**\n Certain connectors require an API usage fee charged to you by the company, not Domo, depending on the customers' accounts with that company. Use of this connector may require an API usage fee.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0LinkedIn account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0LinkedIn connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing\u00a0DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is useful for measuring engagement from company updates and posts.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Company share\u00a0statistics\n* Video analytics\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Marketing roles, especially those involving social engagement\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 10 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0LinkedIn account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you use to log in to LinkedIn\n* The password you use to log in to LinkedIn\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0LinkedIn Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0LinkedIn Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0LinkedIn connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0LinkedIn accounts in Domo)\n\n\n to open the\u00a0LinkedIn OAuth screen where you can enter the email address and password you use to log in to LinkedIn. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0LinkedIn DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report\n\ns**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the LinkedIn report you want to run.
