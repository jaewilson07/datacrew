Presto was designed and written from the ground up for interactive analytics and approaches the speed of commercial data warehouses while scaling to the size of organizations like Facebook.\n\nFor more information about the Presto\u00a0API, visit their website\n\nhttps://prestoapi.com/\n\n.\n\n\n The Presto\u00a0connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n **Database**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Presto\u00a0database in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Presto\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a Presto\u00a0database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The user should have been granted access to query tables in the\n\n\n system.jdbc\n\n\n schema\n* Username, password & access token can be found at the Presto server in the configurations.\n* The user should provide user, password if the Presto server is configured to use basic auth.\n* The user should provide an access token if the Presto server is configured for the token-based authentication.\n* The username and password you use to log into your Presto database\n* The host name for the database\n* The port number for the database\n* Your access token\n\nConnecting to Your Presto\u00a0Database\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Presto\u00a0Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n When using the copy/paste function for your credentials, ensure there is no whitespace at the beginning or end of the string. By accidentally pasting whitespace, it will cause the connector to error when trying to connect.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the Presto\u00a0database. Example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n\n |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Presto\u00a0username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Presto\u00a0password.\n  |\n|\n Access Token\n  |\n\nEnter your access token.\n\n|\n\nOnce you have entered valid Presto\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Presto\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database, with or without a parameter.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n How would you like to import data into Domo?\n  |\n Select the way you want to import your data.\n  |\n|\n How would you like to build your Query?\n  |\n\nSelect the Query Type. The following query types are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Custom Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute.\n  |\n|\n Query Builder\n  |\n Select a table and fields to auto-generate your query.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute.\n  |\n|\n How would you like to perform your partition?\n  |\n Select the way you want to perform partition.\n  |\n|\n Catalog Names\n  |\n Select the catalog.\n  |\n|\n Schema Names\n  |\n Select the schema name.\n  |\n|\n Select the tables\n  |\n Select the database table.\n  |\n|\n Table Columns\n  |\n Select all table columns you want to appear in your report.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper\n  |\n A query is generated based on the selected fields. Copy and paste this text into the QUERY field. You may edit this query, if desired.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n\n|\n Select partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n\n|\n Enter number of past days for which you want to get data. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. For example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n\n|\n Select the required date format. By default\n **yyyy-MM-dd**\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date Format\n\n|\n Enter the custom date format.\n  |\n|\n Partition Query\n\n|\n\nEnter the partition query to determine the distinct partition tags. The column containing the\n **Date**\n data is your partition column.\n\n\n Example: Select\n **Date**\n from Table\\_Name.\n\n|\n|\n Upsert Key Column(s)\n  |\n Enter upsert key column name or a comma separated list of upsert key column names.\n **Required only when Update method is Merge**\n .\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4403778037399\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003855\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPresto Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,417\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "presto_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
