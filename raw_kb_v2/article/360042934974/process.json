But how can you be sure that the content you're all looking at is the same? How do you know if you brought in the right data? Introducing certified content in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        Using the power of Certification Center, you can now certify your cards so your users know which content has been approved, just by looking at the card.\u00a0Certified content\u00a0gives your business the flexibility to customize certification\u00a0to the specific needs of your company. This means that when your users see a certification badge, it\u2019s been through a unique process tailored to your unique needs.\n                       \n\n                        Certifying a card is as easy as choosing\n                        \n                         Request certification\n                        \n                        from the wrench menu, selecting the appropriate certification process, and clicking\n                        \n                         Submit\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        While a card is\u00a0in the approval process, a badge will appear on the card so users can check the status of the certification. Because it\u2019s powered by Certification Center, anyone in the approval chain can send the request back if any changes need to be made.\u00a0Once the card has been through the approval process, it will receive a certification badge so everyone knows\u00a0they can\u00a0and should make business decisions based off this card.\n                       \n\n                        Certified content in Domo. Not just content, but data you can bet your company on.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Certifying Content\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Data Science and Scripting Actions in ETL\n                       \n\n                        Data Science actions are now available by request in ETL. Domo has made it possible for every data owner to leverage powerful data science functions in their DataFlows\u00a0without the need to be an expert in data science modeling languages. This means you can enhance your data with powerful analytics just by adding the desired ETL action.\n                       \n\n                        The following data science functions/methods are available:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Classification (including Random Forest Classification and Naive Bayes)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Clustering (including K Means and K Median)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Forecasting (including ARIMA)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Multivariate\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Outlier Detection (including Standard Deviation and Mean Absolute Deviation)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Prediction (including Linear Regression and Random Forest)\n                         \n\n\n\n                        In addition to all of the above, Python and R scripting actions are also available.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Due to their complexity, Data Science and Scripting actions are currently available only by request.

Using the story that the data tells them, business leaders are able to make critical decisions that impact their business. However, trying to find that story gets increasingly difficult as the size of the data grows at exponential rates, and the data changes every second.\n                        \n\n                        Now Domo makes it easier than ever to find insights in your data.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          NLG (Natural Language Generation) Analysis uses natural language to tell you\u00a0what is interesting or exceptional about your\u00a0data. Where analysts have had to review data using statistical tools and write summaries as data changes, Domo\u2019s narratives automatically expose statistical information and interesting trends about your data, no matter the size of the DataSet or the frequency of updates, delivered in a language every business user can understand.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          With the new Insights feature, you can now view a number of automatically-generated alerts for any given card. Insights\u00a0may be based on anomaly detection, discovered correlations, distribution mapping, and so on.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Both of these features are now available in a new\n                        \n                         Insights\n                        \n                        feed that appears on the right side of the Details view for any KPI card. You can tailor your\u00a0feed to show you the most meaningful Insights and NLG Analyses by rating each one using a \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" icon.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         KPI Card Details View\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Alert Improvements\n                       \n\n                        Contextual Alerts\n                       \n\n                        Using Personalized Data Permissions is a great way to filter your data for different users. But just because it's useful\u00a0doesn't mean it needs to be complex.\u00a0With Contextual Alerts, by default any Alert you create automatically analyzes all the PDP policies that apply to the subscriber and notifies them accordingly. You no longer have to select specific policies to apply.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         PDP and Alerts\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Filter Support for Alerts\n                       \n\n                        Now when you set filters on either a page or card, those filters are honored when you go to create an alert on that page or card. A new option appears in the Create Alert Wizard that lets you choose whether or not to set the alert on the filtered view of the card. You can find this option selected by default when you create an alert from a card or page on which filters have been applied.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Disabled Alerts\n                       \n\n                        Instantly learn\u00a0when\u00a0alerts are broken as well as\u00a0how to correct the problem and get those\u00a0alerts back up and running again. When an alert gets into a broken state, it becomes disabled and shows up in red. It also gives you clear directions on how to solve the problem.\n                       \n\n                        Payment Method Management\n                       \n\n                        Users can now\u00a0instantly gain access to the full features of Domo simply by entering their billing information in Domo.
