Use Domo's Docebo connector to retrieve\u00a0reports for courses, enrollment, learning plans, and more. To learn more about the Docebo API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.docebo.com/lms-docebo-ap...y-integration/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Docebo account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Docebo connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Docebo account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Docebo username and password.\n* The API base URL for your Docebo software. For example:\n\nhttps://doceboapi.docebosaas.com\n* A Docebo client ID\n* A Docebo client secret\n\nFor information about generating your client ID and client secret, visit\n\nhttps://www.docebo.com/knowledge-base/how-to-activate-and-manage-the-sso-and-api-app/\n\n.\u00a0Note that when configuring the app, the\n **Grant Type**\n*must*\n be set to\n **Resource Owner Password Credentials**\n .\n\n\n Connecting to Your Docebo Account\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Docebo Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Docebo account.
