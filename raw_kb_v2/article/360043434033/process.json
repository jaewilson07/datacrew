In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your New Relic account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0New Relic\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is useful for understanding how a new software product is performing with regards to user experience.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Apdex\n* Response time\n* Throughput\n* Error rate\n* CPU usage\n* Memory\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Software developers\n* Product managers\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n It takes about 15 to 30 minutes to set up an API key. The rest of the implementation is straightforward and should not take long.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nEnsure that your tags for tracking user experience are clearly defined in New Relic and you are tagging the specifics of what you want to measure.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0New Relic\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have a New Relic API key. For information about generating an API key, see\n\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apis/requirements/api-key\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0New Relic\u00a0Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0New Relic\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0New Relic\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter the API key you use to log into your\u00a0New Relic account.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0New Relic\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0two primary\u00a0menus,\n **Connector Version**\n and\n\n*Report**\n ,\n\nalong with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the connector version and report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a New Relic report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Application Metrics\n  |\n Returns information about applications monitored by New Relic, including response time, Apdex, throughput and settings.\n  |\n|\n List Application Metric Values\n  |\n Returns a list of data for the\u00a0Application Metric.\n  |\n|\n Mobile Applications List\n  |\n Returns a list of Mobile Applications.\n  |\n|\n Mobile Applications Metric Names\n  |\n Returns a list of Mobile Metrics.\n  |\n|\n Mobile Application Metric Data\n  |\n Returns the list of Mobile Metrics Data.\n  |\n|\n Mobile Crash Metrics Data\n  |\n Returns the list of Mobile Crash Metrics Data.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Applications\n  |\n Select the application(s) you want to retrieve data for.\u00a0The connector version determines how many applications you may select.\n  |\n|\n Metric Names\u00a0(version 2 only)\n  |\n Select\u00a0the metrics you want to appear in your report. You can select as many\u00a0metrics as you like.\n  |\n|\n Start Date (for version 1)\n  |\n Enter the start date for the report using the format\n\nyyyy-MM-dd.\n\nYou can also\u00a0utilize relative start dates by inputting the keywords\n\ntoday\n\nor\n\nyesterday.\n\nOr you can specify offsets like\n\nyesterday-3,\n\nwhich would set the\u00a0start date to 3 days in the past, starting from yesterday's date.\n  |\n|\n Start Date (for version 2)\n  |\n Select the start date for the report.\n  |\n|\n End Date (for version 1)\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0end date for the report using the format\n\nyyyy-MM-dd.\n\nYou can also\u00a0utilize relative\u00a0end dates by inputting the keywords\n\ntoday\n\nor\n\nyesterday.\n\nOr you can specify offsets like\n\nyesterday-3\n\n,\u00a0which would set the\u00a0end date to 3 days in the past, starting from yesterday's date.\n  |\n|\n End Date\u00a0(for version 2)\n  |\n Select the end date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Backfill\u00a0(version 1 only)\n  |\n Enter the number of past days\u00a0you want to retrieve data for on\u00a0the first run (based on the\n **End Date**\n value). Subsequent runs do not backfill data.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\nyesterday\n\nfor\n **End Date**\n and\n\n30\n\nfor\n **Backfill**\n , the report would gather the last 31 days of data on its first run. On subsequent runs, the report would gather only yesterday's data.\n  |\n|\n Time Zone\n  |\n Select\u00a0the UTC time zone for your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure access and logins have not changed for the New Relic system. Often if an account is deleted, you will need to generate another API Token.\n* Sometimes event tagging will not be setup correctly in the New Relic system and will not pull the metrics needed. Sometimes adjustments with even tracking and tagging are needed to facilitate the reporting desired.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434033\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003513\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNew Relic Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,726\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "new_relic_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
