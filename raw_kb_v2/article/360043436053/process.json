You can use Domo's\u00a0Amazon Redshift\u00a0Connector to pull data from your\u00a0Redshift\u00a0database and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting an SQL query. For more information about the\u00a0Redshift API, visit their website. (\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c\\_redshift-sql.html\n\n)\n\n\n The Amazon Redshift connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database based on a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n **Database**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Redshift database in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Redshift connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n Depending on your network's structure, you may need to whitelist any IP addresses necessary for the data connector to retrieve data. Contact your IT administrator for assistance.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Pulling data out of a Redshift data warehouse or data mart.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n This depends on the data stored in the Redshift instance.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * BI leads\n* IT roles\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Anywhere between 5 and 40 hours, depending on configuration settings and the amount of data you are pulling.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 6\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nTry to limit the results set size as much as possible. To speed the acquisition of the data, \"fetch size\" can be increased; however, setting it too high can cause connector run failures as well as performance problems with the Redshift instance. 10000 is a good place to start.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a\u00a0Redshift database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your\u00a0Redshift database\n* The host name for the database server (for example,\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n\n ).\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n\nCA certificate text or URL path is required\n *only*\n if you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n or\n\n*URL Path**\n ,\n\nrespectively, in the\n **Certificate\u00a0Format**\n menu.\n\n##\n Creating a Redshift account\n\nTo create a Redshift user account, contact your Redshift Database Administrator (DBA) and have them follow these directions:\n\n\n By default, only the master user that you created when you launched the cluster has access to the initial database in the cluster. To grant other users access, you must create one or more user accounts. Database user accounts are global across all the databases in a cluster; they do not belong to individual databases.\n\n\n Use the\n\nCREATE USER\n\ncommand to create a new database user. When you create a new user, you specify the name of the new user and a password. A password is required. It must have between 8 and 64 characters, and it must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeral.\n\n\n For example, to create a user named GUEST with password ABCd4321, issue the following command:\n\n\n`create user guest password 'ABCd4321';`\n\n##\n Whitelisting IP addresses\n\nBefore you can connect to a Redshift database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Redshift Database\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Redshift\u00a0Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n JDBC Driver\n  |\n Select the JDBC driver you want to use to connect.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host string to connect to the SQL database. For example:\n\n//\n\nexamplecluster.cpdbcwb2mzr4.us-east-2.redshift.amazonaws.com\n\n\n |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the SQL database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Redshift username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Redshift password.\n  |\n|\n Database Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Format\n  |\n Select\u00a0the certificate format. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n **No Certificate**\n . If you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n , you must paste the text for your certificate in the\n **Certificate**\n field. If you select\n **URL Path**\n , you must enter the URL where your certificate is located in the\n **Certificate**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.\u00a0This is optional. If you do not want to include a certificate, select No Certificate in the Certificate\u00a0Format menu.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Redshift credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Redshift DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\nAccounts\n\ntab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database. You can also choose a specific database table and columns and specify which columns you want to appear in your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the Structured Query Language (SQL) query to use in selecting the data you want. For example:\n\nselect \\* from Employee\n\n|\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n Select the database table you want to appear in your report.\n  |\n|\n Table Columns\n  |\n Select all\u00a0table columns you want to appear in your report.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper\n  |\n Revise this query if desired.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nIf you run into connection issues...\n\n Verify the connection works using pgAdmin.\n* Confirm all of the necessary Domo IPs have been whitelisted (see\n\nWhitelisting IP addresses\n\n, above).\n* Run a profile on the SQL query.\n\nFAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nLimits depend on your server configuration.\n\n####\n What do I need to be aware of while writing a query?\n\nMake sure that all the words, table names and field names are correctly spelled. Refer to the Query Helper field for query help.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436053\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003908\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAmazon Redshift v1 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,075\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "amazon_redshift_v1_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
