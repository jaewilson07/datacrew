When you first install Workbench 5 on your machine, you connect to a Domo server as part of the installation process. This server account becomes your primary account in Workbench 5, and any DataSet jobs you create are included in this account. However, you can add accounts for other Domo servers to your Workbench if you want.

As soon as you add your first account, this dialog no longer appears when you open Workbench.
