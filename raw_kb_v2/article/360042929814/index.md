LinkedIn is a business and employment-oriented service used for professional networking. To learn more about the LinkedIn API, visit their page (

https://developer.linkedin.com/

).


 You connect to your LinkedIn Enterprise account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the LinkedIn Enterprise connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


**Important:**
 LinkedIn has announced that they are disabling version 1 of their API on May 1, 2019. This is the API used by the LinkedIn and LinkedIn Enterprise connectors. LinkedIn has released a new version of the API, which has been implemented in Domo as the connector LinkedIn V2. Due to the two versions being considerably different, there is no way to automatically migrate existing LinkedIn DataSets to the new LinkedIn V2 connector. You will need to create new DataSets using the LinkedIn V2 connector. If there are metrics or features that are not available in the new connector, please contact Domo Support as soon as possible so those features can be added to the new connector.


 These changes do not apply to DataSets using the LinkedIn Ads connector as it is already on the new API version.

Connecting to Your LinkedIn Enterprise Account

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the LinkedIn Enterprise Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

In the
 **Credentials**
 pane, you are first asked to enter the client ID and client secret for your LinkedIn Enterprise account. After you click
 **Connect**
 , you are prompted to open the LinkedIn OAuth screen where you can enter your LinkedIn Enterprise credentials. Once you have entered valid LinkedIn Enterprise credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new LinkedIn Enterprise DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are currently logged into your personal LinkedIn account, you will need to sign out of LinkedIn before authorizing the Domo LinkedIn Connector for your company's LinkedIn account. If you do not sign out of your personal LinkedIn account, you will see an authorization window appear and disappear without prompting you to authenticate the LinkedIn account you wish to use.

 FAQs
------


#####
 How often can the data be updated?

DataSets should be set to update once a day.

####
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

LinkedIn limits how many calls can be made per day by each user and by Domo as a whole. The exact number of calls is different for each report in the connector. It is recommended that you not run your DataSets more often than you need to. Generally speaking, once per day will get you the data you need and will not take available calls away from other users.

####
 Do I need a certain kind of account to use this connector?

Yes. The owner of the LinkedIn account must be an administrator on your company's page.

####
 Can I get details about company pages as well as personal pages through this connector?

This connector can only return details about company pages. The authenticated user must be an administrator for the company page he/she is trying to query.
