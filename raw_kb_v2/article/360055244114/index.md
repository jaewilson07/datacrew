.


###
 Map Card

New options to make your maps pop including: border options, min and max value scales, and allow three bigger sizes on bubbles in your Lat/Long maps to really make a compelling data story. Emphasize the bigger numbers in a bold new way. For more information, see

Latitude-Longitude Map

.

##
 Card data point limit increase

Now you have the power to render very large amounts of data in your charts. You can now use the
 **Limit Rows**
 command inside of the Analyzer to set values larger than would otherwise be possible. To keep the responsiveness fast on your Dashboards, the chart engine limits the number of rows it downloads to the browser. Now you can override these limits by explicitly setting these values. For more information, see

Card Building FAQs

.


###
 Control messages

Control the messages your users see in charts when the "No data in filtered range" message is called for. Set your own personalized message instead.
