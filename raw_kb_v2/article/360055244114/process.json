Now you control the look of your tables more than ever before. For more information, see\n\nTable Chart\n\n.\n\n###\n Paging\n\nHandle larger tables than ever before with dynamic paging of rows of data in your Mega Table Cards.\n\n###\n Copy\n\nCopy has been added to your Mega Tables for easy movement of data by using copy and paste.\n\n##\n Multi-Value\u00a0Gauge\n\nNow you have more customizable options to enhance the look of the text on your chart. Choose between new Bold and Italics options. For more information, see\n\nMulti-Value Gauge\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Map Card\n\nNew options to make your maps pop including:\u00a0border options, min and max value scales, and allow three\u00a0bigger sizes on bubbles in your Lat/Long maps to really make a compelling data story. Emphasize the bigger numbers in a bold new way. For more information, see\n\nLatitude-Longitude Map\n\n.\n\n##\n Card data point limit increase\n\nNow you have the power to render very large amounts of data in your\u00a0charts. You can now use the\n **Limit Rows**\n command inside of the Analyzer to set values larger than would otherwise be possible. To keep the responsiveness fast on your Dashboards, the chart engine limits the number of rows it downloads to the browser. Now you can override these limits by explicitly setting these values. For more information, see\n\nCard Building FAQs\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Control messages\n\nControl the messages your users see\u00a0in charts when the \"No data in filtered range\" message is called for. Set your own personalized message instead.\n\n\n Updated Radial Gauges\n-----------------------\n\nNew Radial Gauge with options to set the look you want including:\n\n Gauge width\n* Ticks (major and minor)\n* Degrees of display\n* Needle look\n* Colors\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nRadial Gauge\n\n.\n\nDashboard Save As options\n---------------------------\n\nNew\n **Duplicate all Cards**\n option when you choose\n **Save As**\n on a Dashboard. Saves time when creating new versions of a Dashboard as it\u00a0allows you to easily reference original Cards without creating copies. Uncheck the box to use the original Cards. For more information, see\n\nDuplicating Dashboards (\"Save As\")\n\n.\n\nGroup Management\n------------------\n\nImproved Group Management to give better oversight, simpler management, and integrate with enterprise systems (such as Active Directory).
