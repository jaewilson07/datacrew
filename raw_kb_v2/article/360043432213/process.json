To learn more about the Infusionsoft API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.infusionsoft.com/\n\n).\n\n\n The Infusionsoft and Infusionsoft Enterprise connectors are exactly the same, except that the Enterprise version asks you for a client ID and a client secret in addition to the usual email address and password. This provides an extra layer of security.\n\n\n You connect to your Infusionsoft account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Infusionsoft connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Infusionsoft account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you used to register with Infusionsoft\n* Your Infusionsoft password\n* An Infusionsoft client ID and client secret (Enterprise version only)\n\nRefer to\n\nthis article\n\nto learn how to find your client ID and client secret.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Infusionsoft Account\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Infusionsoft Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nBoth versions of the Infusionsoft connector (standard as well as Enterprise) use\u00a0OAuth to connect. In the Enterprise version of the connector, you are also asked to enter your client ID and client secret. (These fields do not appear in the standard version of the connector.) For information about finding these credentials, go here:\n\nhttps://developer.infusionsoft.com/g...ed-oauth-keys/\n\nOnce you have entered your client ID and client secret (Enterprise version only), click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Infusionsoft accounts in Domo) to open the Infusionsoft OAuth screen where you can enter your Infusionsoft\u00a0email address and password. Once you have entered valid Infusionsoft credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Infusionsoft DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Infusionsoft when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Infusionsoft.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Infusionsoft report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Affiliate - Clawbacks\n  |\n Retrieves all clawed back commissions for a particular affiliate.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate - Commissions\n  |\n Retrieves all commissions for a specific affiliate within a date range.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate - Payments\n  |\n Retrieves all payments for a specific affiliate within a date range.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate - Redirect Links\n  |\n Retrieves a list of the redirect links for the specified Affiliate.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate Summary\n  |\n Retrieves a summary of statistics for a list of affiliates.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate - Running Totals\n  |\n Retrieves the current balances for Amount Earned, Clawbacks, and Running Balance.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate Program - All Programs\n  |\n Retrieves a list of all Affiliate Programs in the application.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate Program - Affiliate's Programs\n  |\n Retrieves a list of all of the Affiliate Programs for the specified affiliate.\n  |\n|\n Affiliate Program - Program's Affiliates\n  |\n Retrieves a list of all of the affiliates with their contact data for the specified program.

If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Infusionsoft.\n\n####\n My DataSet is taking a long time to run.\u00a0What's going on?\n\nThe Infusionsoft API often returns particular errors. Domo's Infusionsoft connector waits for a certain amount of time then retries if it receives one of these errors.\n\n If the Infusionsoft API returns \"[DatabaseError] Query took too long and was cancelled,\"\u00a0we will retry with a rolling backoff 5 times starting with 5 seconds, then 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute,\u00a0up until\u00a05 minutes. By then it will usually fail with \"This saved search is blocked temporarily.\"\n* If Infusionsoft API returns \"[DatabaseError] Too many consecutive failures. This saved search is blocked temporarily,\"\u00a0we will retry every 20 minutes up to 10 times.\n\n\n#####\n What can I do if my DataSets are running slowly?\n\nInfusionsoft allows only a certain number of requests per day. To avoid rate limit errors, the DataSets are throttled to not exceed that number. If you want your DataSets to run more quickly, use the Infusionsoft Enterprise connector to avoid being in the same throttling pool as other Domo customers.\n\n####\n What values should I use when registering an application (Enterprise version only)?\n\nAll of the fields are optional except for the name of your application, for which you can choose whatever name you feel is appropriate. For extra security, you may want to enter the Register Callback URL:\n\nhttps://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/o...prise/exchange\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043432213\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003685\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nInfusionsoft/Infusionsoft Enterprise Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,380\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "infusionsoftinfusionsoft_enterprise_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
