Intro
-------

Infusionsoft offers an e-mail marketing and sales platform for small businesses, including products to streamline the customer lifecycle, customer relationship management, marketing automation, lead capture, and e-commerce. To learn more about the Infusionsoft API, visit their page (

https://developer.infusionsoft.com/

).


 The Infusionsoft and Infusionsoft Enterprise connectors are exactly the same, except that the Enterprise version asks you for a client ID and a client secret in addition to the usual email address and password. This provides an extra layer of security.


 You connect to your Infusionsoft account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Infusionsoft connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Infusionsoft account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The email address you used to register with Infusionsoft
* Your Infusionsoft password
* An Infusionsoft client ID and client secret (Enterprise version only)

Refer to

this article

to learn how to find your client ID and client secret.


 Connecting to Your Infusionsoft Account
-----------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Infusionsoft Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

Both versions of the Infusionsoft connector (standard as well as Enterprise) use OAuth to connect. In the Enterprise version of the connector, you are also asked to enter your client ID and client secret. (These fields do not appear in the standard version of the connector.) For information about finding these credentials, go here:

https://developer.infusionsoft.com/g...ed-oauth-keys/

Once you have entered your client ID and client secret (Enterprise version only), click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Infusionsoft accounts in Domo) to open the Infusionsoft OAuth screen where you can enter your Infusionsoft email address and password. Once you have entered valid Infusionsoft credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Infusionsoft DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Infusionsoft when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Infusionsoft.

.


 You can also query on date fields. Here are some examples:

would find data updated on a day.
* 'LastUpdated':'2016%'

would find data updated on year.

 FAQs
------


#####
 How do I know my Infusionsoft account credentials are secure?

Both versions of the Infusionsoft connector use Oauth, which authenticates the account without Domo ever having access to your Infusionsoft account credentials.

####
 How often can the data be updated?

As often as needed.

####
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

No.

####
 Can I use the same Infusionsoft account for multiple DataSets?

Yes.

####
 When I click
 **Add Account**
 , why am I getting automatically validated without having to enter credentials?

If you are already logged into Infusionsoft when you connect to Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Infusionsoft.

####
 My DataSet is taking a long time to run. What's going on?

The Infusionsoft API often returns particular errors. Domo's Infusionsoft connector waits for a certain amount of time then retries if it receives one of these errors.

 If the Infusionsoft API returns "[DatabaseError] Query took too long and was cancelled," we will retry with a rolling backoff 5 times starting with 5 seconds, then 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, up until 5 minutes. By then it will usually fail with "This saved search is blocked temporarily."
* If Infusionsoft API returns "[DatabaseError] Too many consecutive failures. This saved search is blocked temporarily," we will retry every 20 minutes up to 10 times.


#####
 What can I do if my DataSets are running slowly?

Infusionsoft allows only a certain number of requests per day. To avoid rate limit errors, the DataSets are throttled to not exceed that number. If you want your DataSets to run more quickly, use the Infusionsoft Enterprise connector to avoid being in the same throttling pool as other Domo customers.

####
 What values should I use when registering an application (Enterprise version only)?

All of the fields are optional except for the name of your application, for which you can choose whatever name you feel is appropriate. For extra security, you may want to enter the Register Callback URL:

https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/o...prise/exchange
