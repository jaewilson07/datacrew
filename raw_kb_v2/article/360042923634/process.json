All you need to do is pull out the column to be counted, remove duplicates, and do a\n                        \n                         GROUP BY\n                        \n                        , and a distinct count of the column will be shown.\n                       \n\n\n                         To show the distinct count for a column in ETL,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note:\n                            \n                            Perform these steps\n                            \n                             after\n                            \n                            all other DataFlow transformations have been completed.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Use the\n                          \n                           Select Columns\n                          \n                          tile to select any columns that need a distinct count or can be used to group the other columns.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Use the\n                          \n                           Remove Duplicates\n                          \n                          tile\u00a0to reduce the data down to unique rows of data.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Use the\n                          \n                           Group By\n                          \n                          tile.
