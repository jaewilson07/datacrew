Luckily you can accomplish this by doing a small amount of data manipulation. All you need to do is pull out the column to be counted, remove duplicates, and do a\n\nGROUP BY\n\n, and a distinct count of the column will be shown.\n\n\n**To show the distinct count for a column in ETL,**\n\n\n**Note:**\n Perform these steps\n *after*\n all other DataFlow transformations have been completed.\n\n. Use the\n **Select Columns**\n tile to select any columns that need a distinct count or can be used to group the other columns.\n2. Use the\n **Remove Duplicates**\n tile\u00a0to reduce the data down to unique rows of data.\n3. Use the\n **Group By**\n tile. Identify which column you will be grouping by (i.e. whatever would be in the\n\nGROUP BY\n\nstatement within a MySQL DataFlow) and what columns will be aggregated, then select\n **Number of Values**\n for the aggregation.\n4. Join this data back onto the final transform of the original DataFlow.\n\nThis will result in a unique count for each row of data. You can then use a\n\nMIN()\n\nor\n\nMAX()\n\naggregation to get the actual count.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042923634\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004597\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nShowing the Distinct Count for a Column\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,235\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "showing_the_distinct_count_for_a_column", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "transformation_tips_and_tricks", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoJGAS"}]}
