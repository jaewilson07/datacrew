New features and enhancements
-------------------------------

Features and enhancements in this release include the following:

##
 Custom Map Regions

People often want to represent unique regional areas in their maps. Many businesses divide data in heavily populated states like California or New York into multiple regions.


 With custom map regions, you can easily set up regional groupings in both built-in and custom maps. This provides the option to group zip codes, counties, or states into regions that match your specific regional needs.

Creating a Map with Regions

.

##
 Improved Mobile Home Experience

The mobile app home experience empowers you to personalize Domo with shortcuts to the content most important to you. Add trends, Dashboards, Cards, Buzz, or Projects to your custom home screen.


 The addition of Global Search to home lets you search mobile by pulling down from the top of your screen. The look of the home screen has also been refreshed with updated tile illustrations and a scrolling flow.

##
 NLQ Bots and Public DataSets in Appstore

The Appstore now provides access to all of the NLQ Bots and public DataSets available in Domo. You can deploy any Bot or public DataSet to your own Domo instance with just a few simple clicks.


********NLQ Bots********
 . Domo is excited to announce that NLQ (Natural Language Query) Bots are available in the Appstore. You can easily and effortlessly add NLQ Bots to any Buzz channel just as you can from Buzz. Once you have added an NLQ Bot, you can begin querying the connector in Buzz for key metrics using natural language. For example, you could find out how many Shopify refunds have been issued by asking a Bot in natural language. Access NLQ Bots in the Appstore by clicking the
 ********Bots********
 tab.


 For more information about Bots, see

.


********Public DataSets********
 . Sometimes your data tells a more complete story when you can blend it with public data. Now, with Domo's new public DataSets, you can explore free public data and connect it directly to your Domo. Once you've selected a public DataSet, you can use it like any other DataSet. Access Public DataSets in the Appstore by clicking the
 ********Data********
 tab.

 Google Sheets Add-On
