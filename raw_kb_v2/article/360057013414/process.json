Use Domo's PostgreSQL Partition Connector to pull data from your PostgreSQL database based on the number of past days provided and compile custom reports. With an intuitive platform that brings all your data and people together in one place, it's easy to collaborate around real-time business insights and move forward with a single version of the truth. You can easily combine your PostgreSQL data with the data from numerous other systems, allowing you to transform your data and make it all available for user self-service. See the metrics you need on any device, automate your reporting, and get alerts when there are important changes to your business. To learn more about the PostgreSQL API, visit\n\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/\n\n.\n\n\n The PostgreSQL\u00a0Partition connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from databases using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n ****Database****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your PostgreSQL database in the\u00a0Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the PostgreSQL\u00a0Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your PostgreSQL account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your PostgreSQL database\n* The host name for the database\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n* CA certificate text or URL path is required\n **only**\n if you select\n ****Certificate text****\n or\n ****URL path****\n ,\u00a0respectively, in the\n ****Certificate type****\n menu.\n\nBefore you can connect to a PostgreSQL database, you must also white list a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your PostgreSQL\u00a0Database\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nPostgreSQL Partition\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nPostgreSQL\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your PostgreSQL username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your PostgreSQL password.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the SQL database. For example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n|\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the SQL database.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Type\n  |\n Select a certificate type. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n ****No certificate****\n . If you select\u00a0Certificate\u00a0text, you must paste the text for your certificate in the\n ****Certificate****\n field. If you select\n ****URL path****\n , you must enter the URL where your certificate is located in the\n ****Certificate****\n field.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.\u00a0This is optional. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n ****No certificate****\n in the\n ****Certificate Type****\n menu.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\n\nPostgreSQL\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nPostgreSQL\u00a0Partition\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database. You can choose a specific database table and\u00a0partition column name. You can also specify the number of past days you want to get data for.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute. Example:\n\nselect DATE from Employee\n  |\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n Select the database table you want to appear in your report.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select the partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter number of past days for which you want to get data. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. Example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ********yyyy-MM-dd********\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date\n  |\n Enter the custom date format you wish to apply to your data.\n  |\n|\n Fetch Size\n  |\n Enter fetch size for memory performance. If it is blank, default value will be 400.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360057013414\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003982\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPostgreSQL Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,691\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "postgresql_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
