Domo trial accounts created from Snowflake Partner Connect have the Snowflake writeback connector enabled which allows users to write data back to their Snowflake data warehouse\u00a0if needed.\n\n#####\n Why am I unable to create a Domo Trial account from Snowflake Partner Connect?\n\n\n* Domo does not support new account sign-ups from personal email addresses (e.g.\n\n'@gmail.com\n\n' or\n\n'@yahoo.com'\n\n). If your Snowflake account is owned by a personal email address, you will be unable to complete the sign-up process. Please contact Domo Support to create a Trial account tied to your business email.\n\n\n For more information on contacting Support, see\n\nGetting Help\n\n.\n* Domo blocks email accounts of certain domains from creating Free Trial Domo accounts as mandated by Domo's Terms and Conditions.\n* If you have previously set up a Free Trial account from a specified Snowflake account, you will not be able to create a new Domo Trial account.\n* If the Snowflake account is also present as a user in Domo, the user will be prompted to connect to Snowflake via their existing Domo account.\n\n\n######\n Am I only restricted to Snowflake Sample data in the newly created Domo account?\n\nNo, the connection to Snowflake data is made for illustrative purposes only. Using Domo's\u00a0federated connection, you can set up a new live query to your non-sample data.\n\n\n See\n\nDomo Federated Query\n\nfor more information.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360048717414\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003151\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDomo Snowflake Partner Connect\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,702\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:10 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "domo_snowflake_partner_connect", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "other_connection_methods", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanzGAC"}]}
