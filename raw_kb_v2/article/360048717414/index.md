FAQs

######
 What are the limitations of a Domo Free trial account created via Snowflake Partner Connect?

Free trial accounts created via Snowflake Partner Connect are similar in nature to regular Domo 30-day free trial instances with one addition. Domo trial accounts created from Snowflake Partner Connect have the Snowflake writeback connector enabled which allows users to write data back to their Snowflake data warehouse if needed.

#####
 Why am I unable to create a Domo Trial account from Snowflake Partner Connect?


* Domo does not support new account sign-ups from personal email addresses (e.g.

'@gmail.com

' or

'@yahoo.com'

). If your Snowflake account is owned by a personal email address, you will be unable to complete the sign-up process. Please contact Domo Support to create a Trial account tied to your business email.
