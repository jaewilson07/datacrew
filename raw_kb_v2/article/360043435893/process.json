You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n ****Reports****\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report Group\n  |\n Select the type of data to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Instructure\u00a0Bridge report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Checkpoint\n  |\n Lists checkpoints (tasks).\n  |\n|\n Course Templates\n  |\n Lists course templates.\n  |\n|\n Enrollments\n  |\n Lists enrollments.\n  |\n|\n Live Courses\n  |\n Lists live courses.\n  |\n|\n Programs\n  |\n Lists programs.\n  |\n|\n Program Learners\n  |\n Lists learners for the programs found in the date range selected.\n  |\n|\n Sub Accounts\n  |\n Lists all Sub Accounts.\n  |\n|\n Tags\n  |\n Lists all tags.\n  |\n|\n Taggable Items\n  |\n Lists all items capable of being tagged for each tag.\n  |\n|\n Tagged Items\n  |\n Lists all tagged items for each tag.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Lists all Users.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Course Template Type\n  |\n Select if the course template is archived or un-archived.\n  |\n|\n Query Date Type\n  |\n Select the query date type.

If you choose\n ****Specific****\n , the report will always pull data for the selected date whenever it runs. If you choose\n ****Relative****\n , the report will pull data for the entered number of back days whenever it runs. For example, if you selected\n ****Relative****\n and entered\u00a07\u00a0for the number of days back, each time the report ran it would pull data for the last 7 days.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the report date you want to pull data for using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for.
