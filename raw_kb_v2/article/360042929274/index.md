Intro
-------

The Analytics Management API allows programmatic access to the Google Analytics configuration data. Use Domo's Google Analytics Management Connector to generate reports to list all Account, Property and View (Profile) information for a user, or determine which goals are active, and to access their configured names. A Google Analytics Account is organized into several levels and the Management API Connector provides a way of interacting with the entities at each level. To learn more about the Google Analytics Management API, visit

 You connect to your Google account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Analytics Management connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Google account and create a Google Analytics Management DataSet, you must have your Google credentials.


 Connecting to Your Google Account
-----------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 ****Credentials****
 and
 ****Details****
 panes in the Google Analytics Management Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 ****Scheduling****
 and
 ****Name & Describe Your DataSet,****
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Google Analytics Management connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 ****Connect****
 (or select
 ****Add Account****
 if you have existing Google accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can enter your Google credentials. Once you have entered valid Google credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google Analytics Management DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 ****Accounts****
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Google.
