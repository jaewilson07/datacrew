In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Taleo account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Taleo connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Taleo account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your company code.\u00a0This is the\u00a0portion of\u00a0the URL of your company's Taleo instance following the slashes (subdomain). For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://domo.taleo.net\n\n, the company code is\n\ndomo\n\n.\n* The\u00a0username and password you use to log into Taleo.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Taleo Account\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Taleo Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Taleo account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Company Code\n  |\n Enter your Taleo company code. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0username you use to log into Taleo.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to log into Taleo.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0credentials and connected to Taleo, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Taleo\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n*Accounts**\n\ntab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu,\u00a0along with other fields and menus that may or may not appear depending on the selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\u00a0Taleo report you want to run. The following reports are available:\n\n*Note:**\n The word \"replace\" in a report name indicates that new report data replaces old data; it is\n *not*\n appended. When using one of these reports, you must select \"Replace\" as your\n **Update Method**\n in the\n **Scheduling**\n tab. For more information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Candidates Applications\n  |\n Retrieves\u00a0data for\u00a0candidates that have applied for positions.\n  |\n|\n Candidates\n  |\n Retrieves\u00a0data for potential candidates.\n  |\n|\n Candidates (replace)\n  |\n Retrieves data for potential candidates.\n  |\n|\n Interviews (replace)\n  |\n Retrieves data for candidates that have completed interviews.\n  |\n|\n Requisitions\n  |\n Retrieves data about requisitions for additional employees.\n  |\n|\n Requisitions (replace)\n  |\n Retrieves data about requisitions for additional employees.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Date\n  |\n Select the date for your report.
