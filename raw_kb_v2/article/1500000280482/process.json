AQUA-powered Redshift is 100% compatible with the current version of Redshift you use today.\u00a0You can use Domo's\u00a0Amazon AQUA\u00a0Connector to pull data from your\u00a0Redshift\u00a0database and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting an SQL query.\n\n\n You connect to your Amazon AQUA account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon AQUA connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n Depending on your network's structure, you may need to whitelist any IP addresses necessary for the data connector to retrieve data. Contact your IT administrator for assistance.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Primary Use Cases**  |\n Pulling data out of a Redshift data warehouse or data mart.\n  |\n| **Primary Metrics**  |\n This depends on the data stored in the Redshift instance.\n  |\n| **Primary Company Roles**  | * BI leads\n* IT roles\n |\n| **Average Implementation Time**  |\n Anywhere between 5 and 40 hours, depending on configuration settings and the amount of data you are pulling.\n  |\n| **Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**  |\n 6\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to an\u00a0Amazon AQUA account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your\u00a0Redshift database\n* The host name for the database server (for example,\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n\n ).\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n\nCA certificate text or URL path is required\n *only*\n if you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n or\n\n*URL Path**\n ,\n\nrespectively, in the\n **Certificate\u00a0Format**\n menu.\n\n##\n Whitelisting IP addresses\n\nBefore you can connect to a Redshift database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\nConnecting to Your Amazon AQUA\u00a0Account\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Amazon AQUA\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n JDBC Driver\n  |\n Select the JDBC driver you want to use.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the endpoint (Host) of the Amazon Redshift database.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Redshift username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Redshift password.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Format\n  |\n Select\u00a0the certificate format. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n **No Certificate**\n . If you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n , you must paste the text for your certificate in the\n **Certificate**\n field. If you select\n **URL Path**\n , you must enter the URL where your certificate is located in the\n **Certificate**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.\u00a0This is optional. If you do not want to include a certificate, select No Certificate in the Certificate\u00a0Format menu.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Amazon AQUA DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database. You can also choose a specific database table and columns and specify which columns you want to appear in your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the Structured Query Language (SQL) query to execute.\n  |\n|\n Schema names\n  |\n Choose a schema name.\n  |\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n Choose a database table.\n  |\n|\n Database Table column names\n  |\n Select the table columns you want to appear in your report.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper\n  |\n For help preparing a query, copy the text from the 'Query Helper' field and paste it into the 'Query' field.\n  |\n|\n Fetch size\n  |\n Enter fetch size for memory performance. If it is blank, the default value will be 1000. If it throws out of memory for a value, decrease fetch size.\n  |\n|\n Boolean format\n  |\n Select the format to be represented in boolean data columns.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500000280482\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003259\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAmazon AQUA Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,645\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "amazon_aqua_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
