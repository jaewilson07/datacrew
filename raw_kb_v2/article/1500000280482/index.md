Intro
-------

Advanced Query Accelerator (AQUA) is a new distributed and hardware-accelerated cache that enables Redshift to run up to 10x faster than any other cloud data warehouse. AQUA-powered Redshift is 100% compatible with the current version of Redshift you use today. You can use Domo's Amazon AQUA Connector to pull data from your Redshift database and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting an SQL query.


 You connect to your Amazon AQUA account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon AQUA connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

*Note:**
 Depending on your network's structure, you may need to whitelist any IP addresses necessary for the data connector to retrieve data. Contact your IT administrator for assistance.

* IT roles
 |
| **Average Implementation Time**  |
 Anywhere between 5 and 40 hours, depending on configuration settings and the amount of data you are pulling.

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to an Amazon AQUA account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The username and password you use to log into your Redshift database
* The host name for the database server (for example,


 db.company.com


 ).
* The port number for the database
* The database name

CA certificate text or URL path is required
 *only*
 if you select
 **Certificate String**
 or

*URL Path**
 ,

respectively, in the
 **Certificate Format**
 menu.

##
 Whitelisting IP addresses

Before you can connect to a Redshift database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the port you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see

Whitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors

.

Connecting to Your Amazon AQUA Account


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Amazon AQUA Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector
