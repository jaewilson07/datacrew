To learn more about\u00a0the Square API, go to\n\nhttps://docs.connect.squareup.com/\n\n.\n\n\n This connector is useful when you have Domo DataSets from different Square accounts that require separate authentication.\n\n\n You configure the connection to your Square DataSets\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Square\u00a0DataSet Union connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to existing Square DataSets\u00a0in Domo\u00a0and\u00a0create a new DataSet, you must have a Domo access token as generated under\n **Admin > Security**\n . This requires Admin privileges in Domo. For more information, see\n\nManaging Access Tokens\n\n.\n\n\n Combining Square\u00a0DataSets\n---------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Square\u00a0DataSet Union Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n In this pane, you enter your Domo access token so you can connect to your existing Square DataSets.\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Access Token\n  |\n Enter your Domo access token, which you generate in\n **Admin > Security**\n .\u00a0This requires Admin privileges in Domo. For more information, see\n\nManaging Access Tokens\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered a valid access token, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Square DataSet Union DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains menus in which you select the report type and configuration of the Square DataSets\u00a0you want to join. Once you have selected the report type and configuration, you can either choose to join all matching Square DataSets\u00a0in your Domo instance or select the specific ones to join.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Square report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Orders\n  |\n UNIONs all or selected \"Orders\" reports with the selected configuration. Configurations include \"Discounts,\" \"Line Items,\" \"Refunds,\" \"Returns,\" \"Order Entries,\" and \"None.\"\n  |\n|\n Payments\n  |\n UNIONs all or selected \"Payments\" reports with the selected configuration.

Configurations include \"Failed\" and \"Sent.\"\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Configuration\n  |\n Select the desired configuration for your report.\n  |\n|\n DataSets to Join\n  |\n Select whether you want to join ALL matching DataSets or choose specific DataSets from a list (\n **Discover**\n ).\n  |\n|\n DataSets\n  |\n Select the DataSets you want to join. If there are no matches for the selected report/configuration combination in your Domo instance, nothing appears here.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n What kind of credentials do I need to use this connector?\n\nYou must have a Domo access token as generated under\n **Admin > Security**\n .
