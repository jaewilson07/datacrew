Pareto charts are single-s


 eries bar charts with categories ordered according to the size of their data items (largest to smallest). A line above the bars shows the cumulative value of all of the data items to that point. A Pareto chart has two scales—one on the left that shows the actual data values, and one on the right that measures percentages of the total value of the data series.
