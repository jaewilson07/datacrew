Alerts can be triggered based on new rows being added, deleted, or updated. Unlike traditional Alerts, DataSet Alerts\u00a0can be built on multiple trigger rules. And the Alert message can include complex calculations and even data from other DataSets\u2014making the custom message more customizable\u00a0and more useful. For example, instead of simply having an Alert message announcing that you gained a new customer account, you can create a much more specific message that tells you the name of the new customer, the amount of the deal, and any other information found in the DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        Be aware that this functionality is currently only supported in \"Replace\" DataSets,\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        \"Append\" or \"Upsert\" DataSets.\n                       \n\n                        With DataSet Alerts, your\u00a0data is more meaningful and more informative.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating an Alert for a DataSet\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Mobile 3.0\n                       \n\n                        With this release, a number of significant interface changes are now available for both our\u00a0iOS and Android applications.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          New navigation for iOS\n                         \n                         .\u00a0We're excited to announce an all-new navigation experience for the iOS Domo mobile application.
