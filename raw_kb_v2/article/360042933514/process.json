You can utilize the Domo Campaigns Markup Language to not only add more Domo content such as summary numbers or titles, but you can also specify the size of a card or limit the number of rows in a table.\n                       \n\n                        When adding a distribution list to a campaign, you must specify columns that can act as filters. The filters are used as personalized data permissions (PDP) within the app. You can always make sure that recipients of your campaign are only seeing the data that is filtered to them.\n                        \n\n                        You can also add paginated Mega Tables and Pivot Tables in the email body and PDF attachments.\n                       \n\n                        Customizing Domo Content\n                       \n\n                        Although you can already insert cards and card titles natively in the app, you can also add content by using the Domo Campaign Markup Language.

custom filters as columns within your distribution list.\u00a0 You must have at least a single filter column but can have multiple filters that will be executed together when rendering your Domo content.\u00a0 Each filter is made up of 3 separate pieces: the\n                        \n\n                          column name\n                         \n\n                        , the\n

values that can be specified in the filter, a normal value and a column reference.\n                       \n\n                        Normal Value\n                       \n\n                        A normal value is considered an actual value in a column to be filtered on.\u00a0 For example, if you want to add a filter where the State column is equal to CA, you simply add CA as the value.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          State is equal to CA\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Column Reference\n                       \n\n                        A column reference will take the value from any column in your distribution list and add that value to your filter.\u00a0 So if you want to filter by state and you already have state defined in your distribution list, you can just reference the column by surrounding the column name with %.\n                       \n\n                        Example 1\n                       \n\n                        If the first row of your distribution list contains information for John Doe and his state is CA, the filter will be set to\n                        \n\n                          State is equal to CA\n                         \n\n                        .\u00a0 If the second row of your distribution list contains information for Jane Doe and her state is UT, the filter will be set to\n                        \n\n                          State is equal to UT\n                         \n\n                        , and so forth.\n                       \n\n\n                         State is equal to %State%\n                        \n\n\n                        Wildcard Filter\n                       \n\n                        If you don't want to specify any filters and wish to send unfiltered data and information in your email campaign, you must still define one filter column with the \"wildcard\" value of\n                        \n                         *\n                        \n                        in it.\u00a0 This will tell campaigns that you understand that the data and information being delivered is unfiltered.\n                       \n\n
