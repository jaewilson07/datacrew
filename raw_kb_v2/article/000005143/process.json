This guide presents general tasks that apply to all apps unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n All tasks in this guide require the user to have previously installed the Domo add-in for the app they are working in. We highly recommend that you download the add-ins from Microsoft AppSource. You can download\n\nDomo for Office\n\n(Excel, PowerPoint, and Word) and\n\nDomo for Outlook\n\n. For more detailed instructions about installing the add-ins, see the\n\nDomo Add-ins for Microsoft 365 Installation Guide\n\n.\n\n\n Updates to the Domo add-ins should automatically apply to your installation.\u00a0If you do not see these updates, you may need to clear your Microsoft 365 add-in's cache. For instructions on how to do this, see\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s documentation\n\n.\n\n\n In addition to the tasks described in this guide, the Domo add-ins provide access to Buzz from within the Microsoft 365 apps. You can select the\n **Buzz**\n tab in the Domo toolbar\u00a0to view existing conversations and start new ones.\n\n\n PDP\n-----\n\nWhen you create content in Domo against DataSets with PDP configured, your Personalized Data Permissions, or PDP, are automatically applied.\n\n\n When you export Domo content or take screenshots to include in documents outside\u00a0of Domo, recipients receive the data as seen by you with your PDP and access levels. The Domo add-ins for Microsoft 365 apps work similarly until the recipient triggers an automatic or manual refresh, at which point the content from Domo is refreshed with the recipient\u2019s individual PDP and access levels.\n\n\n Given this information, you should not use add-ins with the expectation that they are a way to create and share content using PDP.\n\n*Note:**\n If the recipient of your content does not have the Domo add-in, they cannot refresh the content, so the data remains static and as seen by you.\n\n\n####\n Known Limitations\n\n*Outlook**\n\n Auto-refresh functionality is not available because an email is a static document.\n\n*PowerPoint**\n\n Due to a limitation of the current release of PowerPoint, the auto-refresh options are not currently available. You must manually refresh each imported card or DataSet from the Document tab of the Domo toolbar.\n\nGeneral Tasks\n---------------\n\nAll tasks in this section require the same steps in each of the four Microsoft 365 apps for which there are Domo add-ins (Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word) unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n You can navigate through the guide using the linked subheadings below.\n\n Access\u00a0the Domo side rail in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word\n* Access the Domo side rail in Outlook\n* Connect\u00a0to a Domo instance\n* Delete\u00a0a Domo instance\n* Disconnect from/reconnect\u00a0to a Domo instance\n* Switch\u00a0instances\n* Search\u00a0Domo content\n* Import Domo content to your document\n* Apply Filters\n* Update Filters\n* Search for Dashboards and content\n* Search\u00a0for and import\u00a0DataSets\n* Alter\u00a0document settings\n* Alter\u00a0Domo content settings individually\n* Refresh\u00a0all Domo content in your document\n* Refresh\u00a0all Domo content individually\n* Add\u00a0data to Domo\n* Update DataSets in Excel\n* Add data to Domo from an email attachment in Outlook\n\n\n###\n\n\n Access the Domo Side Rail in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word\n\n\n1.
