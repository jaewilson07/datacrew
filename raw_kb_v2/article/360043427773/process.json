They allow you to write custom R or Python algorithms and implement them directly into DataFlows. With this, you can create complex data science analyses that run every time your data updates.\n                       \n\n                        General Information for All Scripting Tiles\n                       \n\n                        This section provides information pertinent to all scripting tiles in Magic ETL. For information on specific tiles, click on any of the following links to jump to the section for that tile:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Python Package API Reference\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           R Package API Reference\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Take A Tour\n                       \n\n                        All scripting tiles have\u00a0the same look. The only difference between them is the supported language.\n                       \n\n                        The main body of the tile is the code editor. This is where you\u00a0write your script. It includes\u00a0syntax highlighting for the specific language the tile supports.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        On the right side of the tile is a searchable list of input tiles currently connected to the scripting tile. Click on the name of an input to inject a code snippet\u00a0into the script at the location of the cursor. This code snippet will read the data into the script and store it in a variable. Rename the variable to whatever you would like.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        There is a second tab on the right side of the tile called\n                        \n                         Packages\n                        \n                        .\u00a0When you click the tab, a searchable list of available packages for the supported language is displayed. Hover over the package name for a description, or click on the arrow that appears to go to the package's documentation website. As\u00a0with inputs, if you click on a package, a code snippet is\u00a0injected into the script at the location of the cursor. This code snippet imports\u00a0the selected library for use in the script.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        On the right side of the tile editor panel toolbar is a template icon button\n                        \n                        . Clicking this button resets the script to the example code template that exists when you first open a scripting tile. Be careful though\u2014if you have already\u00a0written\u00a0a script, clicking this button overwrites your script (after a confirmation prompt). However, as long as you do not close the tile, you can retrieve your overwritten script by placing the cursor within the code editor and pressing Command+z or CTRL+z.\n                       \n\n                        In the\n                        \n                         Schema\n                        \n                        tab,\u00a0you tell the tile what the results of your script looks like. To use this, click\n                        \n                         Schema\n                        \n                        in the tile editor panel toolbar. For a deep dive into this tab, see the\n                        \n                         Populating the Resulting Schema\n                        \n                        section of this documentation.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In the\n                        \n                         Console\n                        \n                        tab, you can see the standard out (\n                        \n                         stdout\n                        \n                        ) and standard error (\n                        \n                         stderr\n                        \n                        ) that your script produces. This tab is not available until after preview is run on the tile, when it will appear as an option in the tile editor panel toolbar.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In the\n                        \n                         Preview\n                        \n                        tab, you can see the results of running your script. This tab also does not appear until after a preview is run. It will then appear as an option in the tile editor panel toolbar.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Getting Data In and Out of the Scripting Action\n                       \n\n                        Domo provides a basic API for importing data (read) from the Domo ecosystem into your script and then for exporting your results out (writing) of the script and back into the Domo ecosystem. The API is different for each scripting language and tries to follow the semantics of the language.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             Be aware of the following data type issues when using scripting tiles in Domo:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                              In Python, LONG becomes DOUBLE in Python because NumPY does not support NULLs in integer columns.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              In both Python and R, DECIMAL becomes DOUBLE because there is no analogous type in NumPY or R.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        The easiest way to see the specific API calls for your language is to examine the initial code template that is provided in a newly created and connected Scripting tile.\n                       \n\n                        Step 1: Import\u00a0The Domo Package\n                       \n\n                        The first line in any script should be used for importing the language-specific Domo package into the script. This follows standard package import semantics for the chosen language. It is part of the initial code template.\u00a0Alternatively,\u00a0you can search for \"domo\" in the\n                        \n                         Packages\n                        \n                        list to the right of the code editor and click on the package to inject the code snippet into the editor.\n                       \n\n                        Step 2: Read Data Into The Script\n                       \n\n                        The next step in writing a script is getting access to the data. Each language will have its own semantic version of a Domo \"read\" method. This is included in the initial code template.\u00a0Alternatively, you can click on one of the inputs in the input list to the right of the code editor. This injects a code snippet that is reading the input data and storing it in a variable. You can rename this variable if you like.\n                       \n\n                        Step 3: Export Data Out Of The Script\n                       \n\n                        The last step in writing a script is returning the results to the Domo ecosystem. Each language has its own semantic version of a Domo \"write\" method. This is also\u00a0included in the initial code template. There is no other way of injecting a code snippet for this, however. Provide the name of the variable that is storing the results of your script to this \"write\" method.\n                        \n                         There can only be one export per script.\n                        \n\n\n                        Populating The Resulting Schema\n                       \n\n                        There are three ways to tell the tile what schema your script produces. These methods can be mixed and matched as necessary to get the proper result. You perform all of these in the\n                        \n                         Schema\n                        \n                        tab of the tile.\n                       \n\n                        Manually Adding the Columns\n                       \n\n                        To add the columns manually...\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Type the name of a column that your script will produce into the\n                          \n                           Column Name\n                          \n                          field.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          In the list of available data types, select the data type for this column.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Add another column by clicking the\n                          \n                           Add Column\u00a0button\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Important:\n                             \n                             All added columns\n                             \n                              must\n                             \n                             be filled out in order for the tile to be considered configured.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Bulk Adding the Columns\n                       \n\n                        To add the columns in bulk...\n                       \n\n                        1.

If a column is provided in the list in the\n                          \n                           Schema\n                          \n                          tab, that column is\u00a0added to the results regardless of whether the script actually produces it or not. If the script does not produce that column, then all of the values for that column are set to null.
