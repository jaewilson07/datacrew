To establish the connection between Domo and Salesforce, an API-enabled user must first authenticate to Salesforce and then grant Domo permission to access to their data. You can then compile reports based on Salesforce data. To learn more about the Salesforce API, visit any of the following:\n\n https://www.salesforce.com/developer/docs/api/\n* http://resources.docs.salesforce.com...\\_reference.pdf\n* https://developer.salesforce.com/doc...data\\_model.htm\n\nThe Salesforce connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n**Note:**\n This connector imports tabular reports only.\n\n\n You connect to your Salesforce account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Salesforce connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for pulling data from any API-enabled editions of Salesforce, such as leads, pipeline activity, and so on.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Number of\u00a0Leads\n* Pipeline Amount\n* Bookings\n* Cases\n* Meetings\n* Portfolio Activity\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Salesforce has broad functionality and applies to many functions (e.g. Sales, Marketing, HR, Operations, Finance, IT, etc...) and also roles (analyst, sales rep, manager, VP, etc...). It all depends on how Salesforce was implemented, and the objects/modules created.\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Depends on the object/report/data size, but Salesforce is very quick to implement. It would take minutes to pull data through once you identify what you need. A very large data pull (millions of rows) would take about an hour.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nWhat's New\n------------\n\nSome recent enhancements to this connector are...\n\n A setting that, if selected, allows the connector to automatically add columns to the output as they are created\n* A\n **Date\u00a0Field**\n setting that pulls all of the data based on your\n **Last Updated**\n date.\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nWhen using the Object Browser mode, Salesforce includes related objects (e.g. Opportunity and Account), so fields from each related object can be brought into the same DataSet. This prevents you from having to always pull in the objects independently (i.e. a separate Opportunity object and Account object) and join them in a DataFlow.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Salesforce account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username for your Salesforce account\n* The password for your Salesforce account\n* An installed Domo Connector Package from the Salesforce AppExchange\u00a0(required as of August 1, 2018; see next section for installation instructions)\n\n\n###\n Installing the Domo Connector Package\n\nThe \"Domo Connector Package\" found in Salesforce AppExchange allows Salesforce users to import their data into Domo. Follow these instructions\u00a0to download and install the Connector Package from the AppExchange.\n\n\n**To install Domo's Salesforce Managed Package,**\n\n. Log into Salesforce.\n2. Navigate to the Salesforce AppExchange at\n\nhttps://appexchange.salesforce.com\n\nand search for \"Domo Connector Package,\" then click on it.\n3. Customers can go directly to the package with the following link:\n\n\n https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1I000001ymKN\n4. If you are installing into a sandbox organization you must replace the initial portion of the URL with\n\n\n http://test.salesforce.com\n\nAlternatively, you can go directly to\n\nhttps://appexchange.salesforce.com/a...A00000EcrsyUAB\n\n.\n5. Click\n **Get It Now**\n .\n6. Choose whether you want to install in a production environment or sandbox.\n7. Check the box reading \"I have read and agree to the terms and conditions.\"\n8. Click\n **Confirm and Install**\n .\n9. Click the\n **Install for All Users**\n tile.\n\nFor more details, see Salesforce's documentation at\n\nhttps://help.salesforce.com/articleV...ges.htm&type=5\n\n.\n\n##\n Verifying your Installation\n\nUse Domo's Salesforce Managed Package Validator to verify that your Salesforce Managed Package has been installed correctly.\n\n\n**To verify your installation,**\n\n. In the Connectors page in either the Data Center or Appstore in Domo, search for \"Salesforce Managed Package\" and double-click on the icon.\n2. Customers can go directly to the package with the following link:\n\n\n https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1I000001ymKN\n3. If you are installing into a sandbox organization you must replace the initial portion of the URL with\n\n\n http://test.salesforce.com\n4. Click\n **Get the Data**\n .\n5. Under\n **Credentials**\n , select your Salesforce account name, then click\n **Next**\n .\n6. Under\n **Details**\n , click\n **Next**\n .\n7. In the\n **Update**\n menu, select\n **Manually**\n , then click\n **Next**\n .\n8. Give your DataSet a name, then click\n **Save**\n .\n\nThe DataSet\u00a0now runs. If everything has been set up correctly, the run will be successful, and a message will appear reading, \"Validation Success: You have set up your Salesforce Managed Package correctly.\"\n\nIf everything has\n *not*\n been set up correctly, the DataSet fails, and a message appears reading, \"You have not installed Salesforce's Domo Connector Package,\" with a help link to this article.\n\nConnecting to Your Salesforce Account\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\u00a0Credentials and\n\nData Selection\n\npanes in the Salesforce Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n , and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Salesforce connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Choose an environment in the\n\nSalesforce Environment\n\nmenu then click\n\nConnect\n\nto\u00a0open the Salesforce login screen. Here you can enter your Salesforce username and password. Once you have entered valid Salesforce credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Salesforce DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Data Selection Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **How Do You Want to Select Your Salesforce Data**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n How Do You Want to Select Your Salesforce Data?\n  |\n Select the method you want to use to pull data from Salesforce. Methods are as follows:\n * Browse Objects and Fields - Lets you select Salesforce objects with associated fields and relationships.\n* Browse Picklists - Lets you browse available dropdown lists in Salesforce.\n* Deleted Objects - Lets you select deleted Salesforce objects. You can only select objects deleted earlier than 15 days ago.\n* Query - Lets you enter SOQL queries to retrieve data.\n* Reports - Lets you retrieve your tabular reports in Salesforce.\n* Sharing Rules and Settings - Lets you select the Rules and Settings that are shared.\n |\n|\n Type of Records to Retrieve\n  |\n Select whether you want to retrieve only active records or include deleted records in the search as well.\n  |\n|\n Unique Field to Retrieve More Than 2000 Rows\n  |\n Select the field that contains a unique value for each row of the report. It will be used to retrieve more than 2000 rows of data.\n  |\n|\n Query Option\n  |\n Select a predefined query (\n **Sales Performance**\n or\n **User Images**\n ) or create your own query (\n **Custom**\n ).\n  |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter your Salesforce SOQL query here. For example:\n\nSELECT\n *Account*\n FROM Account\n\nFor more information about writing SOQL queries, see\n\nhttp://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/officetoolkit/Content/sforce\\_api\\_calls\\_soql.htm\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Reset Schema\n  |\n Choose an option for resetting the columns in your data. In general, you will want to choose the second option when changing the selected fields or custom query. You will then run the DataSet, then switch to the first option to maintain the schema for subsequent runs to avoid data type issues.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nSalesforce is generally a very stable connector so there are just a few common issues that arise with it. Most of the issues are due to insufficient permissions (on both the object and the field). Your Salesforce admin should be able to upgrade permissions on specific objects and fields.\n\n\n Another common error is the \u201cQuery Locator Error.\u201d\u00a0Salesforce only keeps 10 query locators at a time for a single user and for a maximum of 15 minutes. If too many DataSets are running at the same time, some of these will fail. The best way to avoid this issue is to spread out the times when the DataSets are running.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n####\n My profile seems to be not fully set up with the Domo Connector Package. Why?\n\nSometimes a Salesforce profile will get set up after the Domo Connector Package has been installed. Your profile may not get fully set up\u00a0even if it gets installed for all users again. In this case, your Salesforce admin will need to go into the user's profile and look for the\n **Apex Class List**\n permission. Once in there, the admin can search for the two\n **DomoReporting**\n apps and add them to the Apex Class List. Once this has been saved, you should be able to use the Salesforce Connector in Domo.\n\n###\n\nHow many rows and columns of data can a pre-built report pull at one time?\n\n\n Standard and pre-built reports only pull a maximum of 2,000 rows and 100 columns at a time. This is a\n\n\n limitation of the Salesforce API\n\n\n . You can bring in more than 2,000 rows by using the Unique Field option in the\n\nData Selection Pane\n\n. The unique field column you choose must not contain any duplicate values otherwise the report will not match what Salesforce shows.\n\n\n####\n\nWhy do I not see my reports in the report drop down menu?\n\n\n Reports must be in table format and made public in order to appear in the connector and before the data can be pulled in.\n\n\n####\n\nWhy am I unable to select all the columns wanted using the browse picklists option?\n\n\n If you\u2019re testing tables across multiple objects, using the browse picklists, you can only nest down two levels. If you need to pull from more than 2 objects at a time and the objects are not relatable, it is best to pull each object individually and dataflow them together. A map of the relatable objects is found\n\n\n here\n\n\n .\n\n\n####\n\nWhat do I do if I receive the \u201cQuery Locator Error\u201d?\n\n\n Salesforce\n\nonly keeps\n\n10 query locators at a time\n\n\n for a single user and for a maximum of 15 minutes. If too many datasets are running at the same time, some of these will fail. The best way to avoid this issue is to spread out the times when the datasets are running.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042927914\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003667\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSalesforce Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 13,156\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "salesforce_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
