To learn about the\u00a0Loggly API, visit their website (\n\nhttps://www.loggly.com/docs/api-overview/\n\n).\n\n\n Ben Green\n\nSep 29, 2016, 9:55 AM\n\nThe Loggly connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n There is also an advanced version of this connector. This version contains additional configuration options, such as the ability to set the start and end date/time and the update type (forced or automatic). For information about this version, see\n\nLoggly Advanced Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Loggly account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Loggly connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0company's Loggly\u00a0instance and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Loggly username and password.\n* Your company's Loggly base URL (for example,\n\n\n http://mycompany.loggly.com\n\n\n ).\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Loggly\u00a0Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Loggly Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0company's\u00a0Loggly instance. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Loggly username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Loggly password.\n  |\n|\n Base URL\n  |\n Enter the URL of your company's Loggly instance. For example:\n\n\n http://mycompany.loggly.com\n\n\n |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Loggly credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Loggly DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary menu in which you select your\u00a0Loggly report type.\u00a0Other options may be available depending on the selected report type.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0Loggly report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Event Fields\n  |\n Returns the names of all event fields. You can filter fields by metadata by entering the desired metadata\u00a0in the\n **Search Query**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Search Events\n  |\n Returns\u00a0Loggly events based on a specified search. If you do not specify a query, all events are returned.\n  |\n|\n Unique Counts\n  |\n Returns the count for a specified field.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Search Query\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0search query to filter your data.\n  |\n|\n Field Name\n  |\n Enter a field name to return data\u00a0specific to that\u00a0field.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433433\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003576\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nLoggly Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,639\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "loggly_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
