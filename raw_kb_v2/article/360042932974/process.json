Instead of executing the visualization query against Domo, the query is executed at the target database and the results are sent to Domo to render the visualization. This model is especially relevant for users who would like to keep their data at rest within their infrastructure for security or logistical reasons.\n                       \n\n                        Benefits\n                       \n\n\n                         Preserves existing data warehouse investment by allowing for direct connection to customer data lakes and warehouses.\n                        \n\n                         No upload to cloud storage.\n                         \n\n                           Avoids data duplication and costly data transfers.\n                          \n\n                           Reduces data latency due to transfers.\n                          \n\n\n\n                         Domo supports most commonly available databases.

You can use an account for as many tables as you'd like.

Typically, these are on-premise databases. Under this architecture, an intermediate agent is installed in a location that has access to the database. Typically within the firewall of the database. This agent utilizes a socket connection to Domo to capture the queries, connects to the database and executes the queries, and returns the results to Domo. A configuration file is used to manage the connection to Domo and the target database.\n                       \n\n                        Benefits\n                       \n\n\n                         Installed within the network firewall acting as an intermediary between Domo and the target database.\n                        \n\n                         Provides an avenue for custom development if necessary. This gives users the ability to make on the fly adjustments to the queries or query routing.\n                        \n\n\n                        Drawbacks\n                       \n\n                        Before using this solution, be aware of the following:\n                       \n\n\n                         This solution requires an on-premise installation and routine updates to ensure connectivity.\n                        \n\n                         More technical resources can be required to install and maintain.\n                        \n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n\n                         A machine must be in place for the agent to run on and must have access to the target database.\n                        \n\n                         The necessary JDBC driver for the target instance must be available on the server.

This ensures that your data remains protected in your environment. Only the subset of data that is queried is passed to the Domo cloud.\n                       \n\n                        Federated also supports a defense-in-depth model to help ensure that your Data remains protected in all stages of its lifecycle, including data in-transit and at rest.\n                       \n\n                        Data in Transit\n                       \n\n                        All traffic between the Domo cloud and your data warehouse is encrypted.

A TTL (time-to-live) is associated with your data, and once the TTL expires, so too does your data. This TTL is configurable by you and it can be as short as 5 seconds. The customer data TTL has significant benefits as it allows you to simply disable data access, which results in all customer data being inaccessible in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        Getting Started\n                       \n\n\n                         Domo's Federated Agent is available to all customers.

Any performance impact will be related to the ability of the target server to process the queries.\n                       \n\n                        How do I optimize performance?\n                       \n\n                        Each target system has different optimization techniques. Due to the complexity associated with performance tuning and the knowledge it requires of your data warehouse, Domo is unable to assist with performance optimization within your data warehouse.\n                       \n\n                        What options are available to manage the load on the server?\n                       \n\n                        Domo caches the results of queries when possible to be as efficient as possible. Cache settings are configurable in the Federated Adapter.\n                       \n\n                        Does using the Federated Agent require allowing Domo through our firewall?\n                       \n\n                        No, the Federated Agent uses a web socket to establish a connection to Domo. No inbound traffic is required to use the Federated agent.\n                       \n\n                        What does a Federated DataSet look like in Domo?\n                       \n\n                        It looks like a normal DataSet. It displays row counts and the schema, but the actual data is not copied to Domo.\n                       \n\n                        Why am I getting the error \u201cAgent has not been authorized to connect to accounts\u201d?\n                       \n\n                        Your agent must be authorized to accept connections. Please see the\n                        \n                         Getting Started\n                        \n                        section above for details.\n                       \n\n                        How does caching work?\n                       \n\n                        Results are cached at a DataSet & SQL query level. Every Card, Custom App, and DataFlow produce SQL used to select results from an underlying DataSet. It's that combination of the produced SQL and the DataSet that serves as a cache key. If multiple Cards produce the same SQL to retrieve data from the same DataSet, they may utilize the same cache. The same goes for multiple users that access a Card or Cards producing the same SQL against the same DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        How is caching impacted by filtering and/or PDP?\n                       \n\n                        Filtering (Page Filters, Card Filters, Filter Views, etc.) and PDP are included in the underlying SQL. This means that a given Card may have multiple cache keys as described in the above FAQ, particularly if each user has different PDP rules.\n                       \n\n                        When does a cache expire?\n                       \n\n                        The cache timeout (TTL - time to live) is set on the adapter by the user configuring the connection.\n                       \n\n                        Where do I go if I have additional questions?\n                       \n\n                        Reach out to Domo Support or your Customer Success Manager.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042932974", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
