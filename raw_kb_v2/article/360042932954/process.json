(For\u00a0the remainder of these steps,\u00a0we will assume a Webhook Secret is not being used.)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select whether the DataSet will Append or Replace. It is set to Append by default, which is typically what Kinesis users need.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Next\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Name your DataSet and click\n                          \n                           Save\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Your DataSet will appear to run, but there won\u2019t be any data in it. It will only contain\u00a0data after JSON data is sent to the Webhook URL. The system will automatically check for any new data every 15 minutes.

This is a small JavaScript function which will be called whenever new data is pushed to your Kinesis Stream. The function will consolidate all the new Kinesis records into a single JSON array and send that data to the Webhook. Each record will become a single row in the Domo DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        Follow these instructions to create the Lambda Function:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          In the AWS Management Console, choose the Lambda service.

Work with your AWS administrator to make sure that there is a role appropriate for this function. The role needs to be able to read from Kinesis, write to CloudWatch (for logging), and make HTTPS calls.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Create function\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          After the Lambda function has been created, add Kinesis as a trigger to it by selecting\n                          \n                           Kinesis\n                          \n                          from the menu on the left of the screen.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Configure the trigger by filling out the required fields.
