Thank you for purchasing the Domo Finance app! This guide will help you familiarize yourself with the features and layout of the app. The Domo Finance app contains three views: P&L (Profit and Loss Statement), Cash Flows, and Balance Sheet. Each of these three statements can be exported as either a PDF or Excel spreadsheet, and are completely driven by your connected financial data. The app serves as a means to visually connect with and customize your important financial statements and data. A Global Settings feature is also included for any user defined as an Admin.


###
 Prerequisites

If you are not an Admin role or part of the "\_FinanceApp\_Admin\_" user group, then you will not be able to modify settings in the finance app which affect the user experience of the app, for example default view, period vs calendar month names and more.

##
 Global Settings

###
 Show periods instead of month names

Now you are able to change how the app display the calendar. If you want to display periods instead of month names, first you need to open the burger menu that will show all the Landing


 pages, export button and the Global Settings button.


 At the Global Settings menu, click on the toggle at the “Numerical Periods” row, this will enable the change of month names to periods.

Finally, click on save and the app will now show Periods instead of months names.


####
 Trendline chart using average amount

You can configure the trendline displayed in the app to use a value from your input dataset. This allows you to display an average in the trendline which you calculate externally.


 Add a column to your dataset called “Average trend” then Open the Global Settings menu.


 Inside the Global Settings Menu, toggle the option “Use Average Column for Trendline”.

Finally, click on save and the app will display the trendline using the average column from the dataset.


####
 Setup Initial Global View

The “Save as Default View” will save all the information as is shown in the view: in app filters, rows expanded, and settings for the

“

App Mode”,

“

Date Grain”,

“

Period”, and

“

Year” dropdowns. Having Admin role or being part of the "\_FinanceApp\_Admin\_" user group is necessary to edit this.


 Before saving the initial global view, you need to select all the options that you want to save as initial view. For example, we are expanding Accounts Receivable, Cash in Bank, Petty Cash, etc. Once we save the initial global view, these rows will be expanded for users by default when they view the app.


 To setup the initial global view you need to access the app settings. To do so click on the Cog that is in the top right of the window of the view that you want to save as the initial global view.

A settings window will appear.

Here, select “View Settings” and click on “Save” that is to the right of “Save as Default View”.

Finally, click on the “X” to close the window.

###
 Set Default Landing Page

An admin has the option of enabling the default landing page as well as choosing which report users will see when they first navigate to Domo Finance.

In the config settings for each view an admin has the option to save the current settings as the default view or delete the current default view.


 The filters for the App Mode, Date Grain, Period, and Year Dropdowns will return to the default view.

###
 Use Average Column for Trendline

An admin can plot the values from the average column in your dataset for the trendline.

###
 Numerical Periods
