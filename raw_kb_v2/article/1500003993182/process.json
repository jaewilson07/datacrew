This guide will help you familiarize yourself with the features and layout of the app. The Domo Finance app contains three views: P&L (Profit and Loss Statement), Cash Flows, and Balance Sheet. Each of these three statements can be exported as either a PDF or Excel spreadsheet, and are completely driven by your connected financial data. The app serves as a means to visually connect with and customize your important financial statements and data. A Global Settings feature is also included for any user defined as an Admin.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        If you are not an Admin role or part of the \"_FinanceApp_Admin_\" user group, then you will not be able to modify settings in the finance app which affect the user experience of the app, for example default view, period vs calendar month names and more.\n                       \n\n                        Global Settings\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Show periods instead of month names\n                        \n\n\n\n                        Now you are able to change how the app display the calendar.

This allows you to display an average in the trendline which you calculate externally.\n                       \n\n                        Add a column to your dataset called \u201cAverage trend\u201d then Open the Global Settings menu.\n                       \n\n                        Inside the Global Settings Menu, toggle the option \u201cUse Average Column for Trendline\u201d.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Finally, click on save and the app will display the trendline using the average column from the dataset.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Setup Initial Global View\n                       \n\n                        The \u201cSave as Default View\u201d will save all the information as is shown in the view: in app filters, rows expanded, and settings for the\n                        \n                         \u201c\n                        \n                        App Mode\u201d,\n                        \n                         \u201c\n                        \n                        Date Grain\u201d,\n                        \n                         \u201c\n                        \n                        Period\u201d, and\n                        \n                         \u201c\n                        \n                        Year\u201d dropdowns.
