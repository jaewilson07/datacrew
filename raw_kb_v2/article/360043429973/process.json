You can also open the details pane by clicking\n\nin the conversation pane.\n\n\n You can also enlarge the Buzz panel view by dragging the left edge of the panel as wide as you want.\n\n\n The main interface components of Buzz are the same in the web and desktop versions. The only difference is that the desktop version includes additional options in a toolbar. For more information, see\n\nDesktop version toolbar options\n\n.\n\n*Video - Buzz Overview**\n\nBuzz Menu, Status, and Universal Compose\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn the black bar at the top of Buzz, you can access the\n **Buzz**\n menu, which includes a number of general-purpose settings options, as well as the Universal Compose icon. This bar is available in every pane in Buzz, so you can take advantage of these options no matter where you are.\n\n\n####\n Buzz Menu\n\nIn the Buzz menu, you have access to the following options:\n\n **Update your status.**\n Set your status to Available, Busy, Away, or Out of office. You can also add a custom message to your status when you are unavailable.\n* **Toggle Fullscreen**\n . Toggles full-screen mode for Buzz. In this view, all three panels are displayed at once across the screen. You can also toggle full-screen mode\u00a0by entering Ctrl + Alt + x on your keyboard.\n* **Mark All as Read.**\n This\u00a0lets you mark all messages as read, thereby removing all notifications for unread messages.\n* **Manage Settings**\n . Opens your\n\nNotification Settings\n\n.\n* **Show Keyboard Shortcuts**\n . Opens a list of keyboard shortcuts for use in Buzz.\n* **Email to Buzz**\n . Lets you convert an email message into a Buzz conversation. For more information, see\n\nImporting an Email Thread into Buzz\n\n.\n* **Download the Buzz App**\n . Lets you download the desktop version of Buzz to your computer. For more information, see\n\nDownloading and Running the Buzz Desktop Version\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Status\n\nUpdate your status on web or mobile to\n **Available**\n ,\n **Busy**\n ,\n **Away**\n , or\n **Out of the office**\n . When someone sends you a 1:1 message or @mentions you in a conversation and your status is set to something other than Available, they will see a warning message that states you are unavailable. You can add custom messaging to your status message when you are unavailable as well as assign a delegate when you are\n **Out of office**\n . An icon on your avatar indicates your current status. When your status is set to\n **Available**\n , a colored dot will show on your avatar, Green indicates you are Available and have been interacting with Domo. Yellow indicates that you Available, but have not been active within Domo recently. Gray means you are logged out of Domo. These colors are automatically updated by the system based on your activity inside of Domo.\n\n###\n Universal Compose\n\nUniversal Compose lets you compose a Buzz message from anywhere in Buzz\u00a0without first having to locate and open a conversation. You can start a conversation from scratch by searching for the people or groups you want to message. Or, you can add a message onto an existing conversation by searching for the conversation.\n\n\n This dialog opens when you click the\n\nicon that appears over any pane in Buzz OR when you click\n\nicon in the\n **Conversations**\n area in the navigation pane. Here you can initiate a public or private conversation with select individuals or groups or open an existing conversation you are already included in and contribute to it.\n\n\n The following screenshot points out the most important parts of this dialog:\n\nYou can learn more about these components in the following table:\n\n\n Component\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Conversation search box\n  |\n Lets you search for a person or group to start a new conversation with, or an existing conversation to join.\n  |\n|\n New topic toggle\n  |\n Lets you specify whether the topic you want to add to is new or already exists.

These icons are as follows:\n\n\n|\n Icon\n  |\n Conversation Type\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\n|\n**Public conversation**\n .

This pane displays all messages you have flagged (by mousing over the message, clicking the ellipsis icon, and selecting\n **Flag for follow-up**\n ). You can click a message to open it in the conversation pane so you can take action on it. Or, if you have already taken the necessary action, you can unflag it by clicking its \"x\" icon (causing it to be removed from the\n **Flag for follow-up**\n pane).\n\n\n###\n Discover Pane\n\nYou can access the\n **Discover**\n pane by clicking\n **Discover**\n in the navigation pane.
