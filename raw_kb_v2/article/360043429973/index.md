Intro
-------

Buzz consists of the following panes:

 A navigation pane that lists all of your conversations and provides access to different options.
* A conversation pane in which the selected conversation appears.
* A details pane where you can view information about the selected conversation and configure settings.
* A "Flag for follow-up" pane in which you can view all conversations you have flagged for further review.
* A "Discover" pane that shows trending topics, online users, recent conversations, etc.

By default, only one pane appears on the right side of the screen when you open Domo; however, you can toggle the full-screen mode for Buzz by doing any of the following:

 Entering Ctrl + Alt + x on your keyboard.
* Selecting
 **Toggle Fullscreen**
 in the
 **Buzz**
 menu at the top of Buzz.

In this mode, the conversation and Buzz menu panes are both open by default. You can also open the details pane by clicking

in the conversation pane.


 You can also enlarge the Buzz panel view by dragging the left edge of the panel as wide as you want.


 The main interface components of Buzz are the same in the web and desktop versions. The only difference is that the desktop version includes additional options in a toolbar. For more information, see

Desktop version toolbar options

 This dialog opens when you click the

icon that appears over any pane in Buzz OR when you click

icon in the
 **Conversations**
 area in the navigation pane. Here you can initiate a public or private conversation with select individuals or groups or open an existing conversation you are already included in and contribute to it.
