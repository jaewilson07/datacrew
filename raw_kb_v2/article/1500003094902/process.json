Use Domo's Snapchat Ads OAuth Connector to receive details about organizations, ads, campaigns and more. To learn more about the Snapchat Ads API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.snapchat.com/ads/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Snapchat Ads account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Snapchat Ads OAuth connector user interface.\u00a0General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n To connect to your Snapchat Ads OAuth account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password of a Snapchat Ads account that has access to the Ad accounts you are interested in.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Snapchat Ads OAuth Account\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n\n*Credentials**\n\nand\n\n*Details**\n\npanes in the Snapchat Ads OAuth Connector page.\n\nThe components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\n\n The Domo Snapchat Ads OAuth connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n\n*Connect**\n\n(or select\n\n*Add Account**\n\nif\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Snapchat Ads accounts in Domo) to open the Snapchat Ads OAuth screen where you can enter your Snapchat Ads credentials. Once you have entered valid Snapchat Ads credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Snapchat Ads OAuth\u00a0DataSet.\n\nYou can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n\nIf you are already logged into Snapchat Ads\u00a0when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n\n*Add account**\n\n. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Snapchat Ads OAuth.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect the Snapchat Ads OAuth report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Object Info: Organizations\n  |\n This report returns all the organizations the logged in user can access.\n  |\n|\n Object Info: Ad Accounts\n  |\n This report returns all ad accounts for the specified Organization.\n  |\n|\n Object Info: Campaigns\n  |\n This report returns all campaigns within a specified ad account.\n  |\n|\n Object Info: All Campaigns\n  |\n This report returns all campaigns within the specified ad accounts.

This is the time of the most recently finalized data. Any data before that time is finalized. Any data after that time is still subject to change.\n\n###\n\nHow do I get information about more than one Ad, Ad Squad, or Campaign at once?\n\nThe \"Statistics: Ad (Insights and Dimensions)\" and \"Statistics: Ad Squad (Insights and Dimensions)\" reports provide the data for a single or objects (ad or ad squad) at once. To get information about multiple objects, you need to use the \"Statistics: Campaign (Insights and Dimensions)\" report.\n\n\n This report allows you to select the metrics to report, and how the data should be broken down. Data can be broken down by Ad, Ad Squad, or Campaign. If you select one of these, the data will be reported for all individual Ads, Ad Squads, or Campaigns.\n\nTroubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500003094902\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003240\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSnapchat Ads OAuth Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,663\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "snapchat_ads_oauth_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
