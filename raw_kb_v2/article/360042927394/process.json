Use Domo's SpringServe connector to retrieve lists of SpringServe\u00a0groups, partners, tags, and domains. To learn more about the SpringServe API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://wiki.springserve.com/display/SSD/Reporting+API\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your SpringServe account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SpringServe connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your SpringServe account and create a DataSet, you must have a SpringServe username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your SpringServe Account\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SpringServe Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your SpringServe account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your SpringServe username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your SpringServe password.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid SpringServe credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new SpringServe DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the SpringServe report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Demand Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of demand groups.\n  |\n|\n Demand Partners\n  |\n Returns a list of demand partners.\n  |\n|\n Demand Tag\n  |\n Returns a list of demand tags.\n  |\n|\n Domain Lists\n  |\n Returns a list of domain lists.\n  |\n|\n Domains in Domain List\n  |\n Returns the domains in a given domain list.\n  |\n|\n Reporting\n  |\n Returns the requested report data.\n  |\n|\n Supply Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of supply groups.\n  |\n|\n Supply Partners\n  |\n Returns a list of supply partners.\n  |\n|\n Supply Tags\n  |\n Returns a list of supply tags.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Enter the ID of the domain you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Interval\n  |\n Select the time interval you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Dimensions\n  |\n Select all of the dimensions you want to return data for.
