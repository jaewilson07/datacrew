 Alchemer (formerly known as SurveyGizmo) is a customer-experience solution that helps you transform to a truly customer-centric organization. It's not always easy to see how the customer feedback opinions correlate with your business decisions. To get at the story behind the surveys, you need context. Domo's cloud-based platform brings all your data sources together in one survey dashboard. See survey results side-by-side with data from marketing, operations, finance, or anywhere else to learn what drove those responses. Use Domo's Alchemer connector to pull data about survey campaigns, statistics, respondents, and responses for all surveys in your account or for a single survey. Get reports on your surveys made to your exact specifications—what you want to see, how you want to see it.

Set your report to "Append" instead of "Replace" so that each new run of the DataSet will add onto the data from the previous run.
