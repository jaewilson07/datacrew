It's not always easy to see how the customer feedback opinions correlate with your business decisions. To get at the story behind the surveys, you need context. Domo's cloud-based platform brings all your data sources together in one survey dashboard. See survey results side-by-side with data from marketing, operations, finance, or anywhere else to learn what drove those responses. Use Domo's Alchemer connector to pull data about survey campaigns, statistics, respondents, and responses for all surveys in your account or for a single survey.
