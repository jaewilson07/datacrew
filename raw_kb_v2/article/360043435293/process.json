It's not always easy to see how the customer feedback opinions correlate with your business decisions. To get at the story behind the surveys, you need context. Domo's cloud-based platform brings all your data sources together in one survey dashboard. See survey results side-by-side with data from marketing, operations, finance, or anywhere else to learn what drove those responses. Use Domo's Alchemer connector to pull data about survey campaigns, statistics, respondents, and responses for all surveys in your account or for a single survey. Get reports on your surveys made to your exact specifications\u2014what you want to see, how you want to see it.\n\nTo learn more about the\n\nAlchemer\n\nAPI, go to\n\nhttps://apihelp.surveygizmo.com\n\n.\n\n\n The\n\nAlchemer\n\nconnector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nAlchemer\n\nconnector user interface.
