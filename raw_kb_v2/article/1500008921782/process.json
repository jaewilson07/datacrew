This allows you to aggregate insights across multiple social media channels. The Domo Sprinklr V2 connector supports custom query reports. Use this connector to instantly connect, visualize, and get insights from your Sprinklr data.\u00a0For more information about the\u00a0Sprinklr API, visit\u00a0their website. (\n\nhttps://developers.sprinklr.com/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Sprinklr\u00a0account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sprinklr V2 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Sprinklr account and create a DataSet, you must have a Sprinklr\u00a0client ID and client secret.\n\n\n To get access to the API, you must submit an application and be approved by Sprinklr. Steps to complete this application process can be found here:\n\nhttps://developers.sprinklr.com/page/Create\\_an\\_APP\n\nYou must also set up a redirect\\_uri to\n\n\n https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/sprinklr/exchange\n\nwhen creating the API key\n\n.\n\n\n Once access is confirmed, you will be able to authenticate using your client ID and client secret.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nSprinklr\n\nAccount\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nSprinklr V2\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nSprinklr\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Environment\n  |\n Select the Sprinklr environment you want to connect to, either sandbox or production.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Sprinklr client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Sprinklr client secret.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\n\nSprinklr\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nSprinklr V2\n\nDataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\nSprinklr V2\n\nreport you want to run.

Let's consider the following values to test the Custom Query report:\n\n\n Single value query inputs:\n\n Reporting engine: INBOUND\\_MESSAGE\n* Report: INBOUND\\_MESSAGE\n* GroupBy Heading: UNIFIED\\_MESSAGE\\_ID\\_0\n* GroupBy Dimension Name: UNIFIED\\_MESSAGE\\_ID\n* GroupBy Group Type: FIELD\n* Projections Heading: totalCount\\_UNIFIED\\_MESSAGE\\_ID\\_0\n* Projections Measurement Name: UNIFIED\\_MESSAGE\\_ID\n* Projections Aggregate Function: CARDINALITY\n* Filters Filter Type: IN\n* Filters Dimension Name: CAMPAIGN\\_ID\\_DIMENSION\n* Filters Values: 1000004845\\_-98\n\n\n Multiple values query inputs:\n\n Filters Filter Type: IN,IN\n* Filters Dimension Name: CAMPAIGN\\_ID\\_DIMENSION,CAMPAIGN\\_ID\\_DIMENSION\n* Filters Values: 1000004845\\_-98, 1000004845\\_1\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the Connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\nFAQs\n-------\n\n###\n\nHow does backfill work?\n\nOn the first run, the Connector will bring in data corresponding to the filter 'Start Date' to 'End Date'.\u00a0 After that, the Connector will set the 'Start Date' to the next day after it was last run, and will use the current date as the value for the 'End Date'.\n\n###\n\nWhat's the behavior difference between the Replace and Append modes in Sprinklr V2 connector?\n\n\n* Replace \u2013 The Replace mode has the standard behavior for all reports, means the old data will be replaced by the new data after the dataset run.\n* Append \u2013 The Append mode has the standard behavior for all reports except the \"Custom Query\"\u00a0report. The subsequent runs in the Custom Query report with Append mode will only get the data since the last time the connector ran.\n\n\n####\n What version of the Sprinklr API does this Connector use?\n\nThis connector uses version 2 of the Sprinklr API.\n\n\n Sandbox API URL:\n\nhttps://api2.sprinklr.com/sandbox/api/v2/\n\nProduction API URL:\n\nhttps://api2.sprinklr.com/api/v2/\n\n\n####\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this Connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint URL(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Campaign By External Campaign\n  |\n /campaign/{externalSource}/{externalId}\n  |\n|\n Campaign By ID\n  |\n /campaign/{campaignId}\n  |\n|\n Case By Case Number\n  |\n /case/case-numbers\n  |\n|\n Custom Query\n  |\n reports/query\n  |\n|\n Message By Message Id\n  |\n /message/byMessageId\n  |\n|\n Profile By Profile ID\n  |\n /profile/{profileId}\n  |\n|\n Profile Details\n  |\n /profile\n  |\n|\n Profile Search\n  |\n /profile/search\n  |\n|\n URL Shorteners\n  |\n /link/shorteners\n  |\n|\n User\n  |\n /scim/{userId}\n  |\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this Connector?\n\nYou need to know if your Sprinklr instance is Production or Sandbox. (Production is the most common.) You also need to create an application to connect to Domo and provide the Client ID and Secret associated with that application.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nSprinklr limits calls to Production instances to 5 calls per second and 500 per hour.\n\n\n Calls to Sandbox instances are limited to 2 calls per second and 100 per hour.\n\n\n Note that a single dataset run may require multiple calls.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nThe most commonly occurring issue with this connector relates to filters. Each report in Sprinklr is filtered and run on a separate query that cleans the Sprinklr data displayed in the reports on the Sprinklr website. When setting up the connector, you\n *must*\n use these same filters;\u00a0otherwise,\u00a0data will be duplicated or missing. To do this, you must\u00a0use the API call that is in the backend of a Sprinklr Report.\n\n\n To access this code or to find the filters and backend report to pull from the connector, do the following:\n\n. Open\u00a0the Chrome browser.\n2. Right-click in the browser and select\n **Inspect**\n .\n3. In the developer screen, navigate to the\n **Network**\n tab.\n4. Refresh your screen on the Sprinklr report page.\n\n\n This causes\u00a0several elements to\u00a0appear under the\n **Name**\n column.\n5. Search through the queries\u00a0and find the corresponding report or data you want\u00a0to replicate.\n6. Select the query and search under\n **requests**\n to find all the inputs you need to enter into the Domo Connector.\n7. Connect to the Sprinklr\u00a0connector to Domo using your credentials.\n8. Select the report used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr this is found under\n **requests >**\n**parameter**\n .\u00a0In the sample it is\u00a0called \u201cPost Insights.\u201d\n9. For\n **Aggregation Function**\n , select the function used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr this is found under\n **groupBys\u00a0>**\n**p**\n**rojections**\n . In the sample it is called\n **SUM**\n .\n10. For\n **Measurement**\n**Name**\n , select the function used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr this is found under\n **groupbys\u00a0>\u00a0projections >\u00a0measurement**\n .\u00a0 In the sample it is called\n **TOTAL\\_ENGAGEMENT**\n .\n11. For\n **Group By Options,**\n enter the\n **groupby**\n fields found in the Sprinklr report under the\n **Requests**\n dropdown menu in the\n **Network**\n tab, using the syntax\u00a0(columnName,dimensionName,groupType,detail=value).\n\n\n For example, if I had the \u201cClient\\_ID\u201d field listed in the group, I would use the following syntax for\n **Group By Options**\n :\u00a0(Client\\_ID,Client\\_ID, field).\n\n\n We also recommend you\u00a0use a date group by even though the Sprinklr report may not contain that information, so the Domo cards will render the data in the needed format.\u00a0For example:\u00a0(date,DATE\\_HISTOGRAM,interval=1h)\u00a0or\u00a0(POST\\_PUBLISHED\\_DATE,FIELD)\n12. For\n **Filters**\n , enter the filters\u00a0used in the Sprinklr report.\n\n\n In Sprinklr these are found under\n **requests > filters**\n .\u00a0 Use the syntax under ? that you find by the\n **Filters**\n box.\n13. (Conditional) If the query code in the Sprinklr report states\u00a0that\n **Columns to Expand**\n and\n **Measurement**\n**Options**\n are being used, enter the info that is included in the \u201crequest\u201d data.\n14. When configuring the time frame, use the time frame stated in the actual Sprinklr report/graph or the one\u00a0needed for your card visualization. For most Sprinklr reports in Domo, no time frame is provided in\u00a0the actual Sprinklr report .\u00a0You can see in the backend that the\u00a0time stated in the\n **Time**\n filter is in a format that is not database friendly or recognizable as a date.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500008921782\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003234\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSprinklr V2 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,455\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "sprinklr_v2_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
