Troubleshooting
-----------------

We have had customers report situations in which they still could not authenticate even with a working developer key. However, they were able to successfully authenticate after creating a SOAP API authorization on the account. The following page provides more information about how to do this:

. (It is possible this issue may only affect users with seller accounts.)
