It is an enterprise-wide hyper-scale repository for big data analytic workloads.\u00a0It makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on Azure. It allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data and helps to speed up your transition from proof of concept to production. Use Domo's\u00a0Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 using AAD connector to pull data files from your Data Lake Store into Domo. You can retrieve data files in any of the following file types: CSV, TSV, and TXT.\u00a0For more information about Azure's API, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azu...ta-lake-store/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 AAD account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\u00a0using AAD connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\u00a0AAD account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your client ID (GUID) and secret key of the client web app obtained from Azure Active Directory configuration\n* Your Microsoft\u00a0Azure Data Lake Storage\u00a0account name\n* Your Tenant ID\n\n\n###\n\nConfiguring Your Azure App\n\nYou must first create a Microsoft Azure Web App to obtain the necessary client ID and secret.\n\n\n**To configure an Azure App**\n :\n\n. Login into\n\nAzure Portal\n\n.\n2. Select\n **Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > New Registration**\n .\n\n3. Fill out the registration form as follows:\n\n Name:\u00a0Enter name for your\u00a0 application.\n* Supported account types: Select an option to specify who\u00a0can use this application or access this API.\n* Redirect URI: Enter the redirect URI.\u00a0The authentication response is sent to this URI after successfully authenticating the user. Providing the URI\u00a0at this stage\u00a0is optional and it can be changed later, but a value is required for most of the\u00a0authentication scenarios.\n\n4.\u00a0Click\n **Register**\n . An overview of your registered App will appear.\n\n\n 5. The\n **Application ID**\n that appears here\u00a0is the\n **Client ID**\n and the\u00a0he\n\n\n**Directory ID**\n\n\n is the\n\n\n**Tenant ID**\n that you will enter in the\n **Credentials**\n pane in Domo.\n\n\n 6. Now, click on\n **Certificates and secrets**\n .\u00a0Certificates can be used as secrets to prove the application\u2019s identity when requesting a token. Also, can be referred to as public keys.\n\n\n 7. Click\n **+New client secret**\n .\n\n\n 8.\u00a0Specify the client secret description and the expiry period for your client secret, and click\n **Add**\n .\n\n\n 9. Copy the value and paste it into the\n **Client Secret**\n field in the\n **Connector credentials**\n section in Domo.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 AAD\n\nAccount\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\u00a0using AAD\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\u00a0AAD\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Azure Application Client ID\n  |\n Enter the client ID (GUID) of the client web app obtained from Azure Active Directory configuration.
