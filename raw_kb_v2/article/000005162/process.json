It makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on Azure. It allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data and helps to speed up your transition from proof of concept to production.\u00a0You can retrieve data files in any of the following file types: CSV, XLS, XLSX and JSON. For more information about Azure's API, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azu...ta-lake-store/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2 OAuth account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2 OAuth Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2 OAuth account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Microsoft Azure App Client ID\n* Microsoft Azure App Client Secret\n* Tenant ID\n\nTo obtain credentials, please reach out to your Microsoft account representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2 OAuth Connector\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake \u00a0Gen2 OAuth Connector\n\npage.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Microsoft Azure App Client ID\n  |\n Enter the client ID (GUID) of the client web app obtained from Azure Active Directory configuration.\n  |\n|\n Microsoft Azure App Client Secret\n  |\n Enter the secret key of the client web app.\n  |\n|\n Tenant ID\n  |\n Enter your Tenant ID.\n\nTo locate the tenant ID, do the following:\n\nNavigate to\n **Portal.azure.com\n\n> Azure Active Directory > Properties**\n .\n\nThe\n **Directory ID**\n is your\n **Tenant ID**\n .\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Gen2\n\nOAuth\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Gen2\n\nOAuth\u00a0 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n What file type would you like to import?\n  |\n Select the file type that you want to import.\n  |\n|\n Enter Storage Account Name\n  |\n Enter the storage account name.\n  |\n|\n Container Name\n  |\n Select the container.\n  |\n|\n How would you like to choose the directory name?\n  |\n Select how you want to choose the directory name.\n  |\n|\n Discover Directory Name\n  |\n Select the directory name.\n  |\n|\n Enter Directory Name\n  |\n Enter the directory name.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n test\n  |\n Example for main or root directory.\n  |\n|\n test/test\n  |\n Example for sub- directory.\n  |\n|\n test/test/test\n  |\n Example for sub-sub-directory\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Would you like to pull data from multiple files?\n  |\n Select if you want to retrieve data from multiple files in the directory.\u00a0If you want to pull data from multiple files, select the files with same schema.\n  |\n|\n Discover Files\n  |\n Select the files with the same schema to pull the data.\n  |\n|\n How would you like to choose the File name?\n  |\n Select how you want to choose the file name.\n  |\n|\n Enter File Name\n  |\n Enter the File name.\n  |\n|\n Discover File Name\n  |\n Select the File name.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Advanced Pane\n\nThis pane contains the\n **Advanced**\n menu.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Select the delimiting character\n  |\n Select the delimiting character used in your file.
