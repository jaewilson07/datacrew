Use Domo's Amazon Advertising connector to retrieve entities reports, performance reports, and portfolio listings. To learn more about the Amazon Advertising API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://advertising.amazon.com/about-api\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Amazon Advertising account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon Advertising connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n To connect to your Amazon Advertising account and create a DataSet, you must have your Amazon\u00a0credentials (email address or phone number and password).\n\n###\n\nHow to create a new\u00a0Amazon Advertising\u00a0Account?\n\n*To add an Amazon Advertising\u00a0account to Domo from the Accounts view:**\n\n\n 1. Navigate to the\n **Accounts**\n section of the\n\n\n**Data Center**\n\n\n by clicking on the Accounts icon in the left-hand pane in the Data Center.\n\n2. In\n **Accounts**\n , click\n **Add Account**\n .\n\n3. Select the desired Amazon Advertising connector and click\n\n\n**Connect**\n .\n\n4. Select the region of the Amazon marketplace you want to access, and click\n **Connect**\n .\n\n5. An\u00a0Amazon login window will appear. Enter your Amazon credentials and log into your Amazon account.\n\n\n 6.\u00a0An entry for the new Amazon Advertising\u00a0account will appear\u00a0in the\n **Accounts**\n view listing.\n\n\n**To add an\n\n\n Amazon Advertising\n\n\n account to Domo by\u00a0adding a DataSet and entering new account information:**\n\n\n 1. While creating a new\u00a0Amazon Advertising account, you need to select the region of the Amazon marketplace you want to access and click\n\n\n**Connect**\n .\n\n2.\u00a0An\u00a0Amazon login window will appear. Enter your Amazon credentials and log into your Amazon account.\n\n\n 3.\u00a0As you add the Amazon Advertising\u00a0account through the connector, an entry for the new account appears automatically in the\n **Accounts**\n view.\n\n###\n\nHow to associate my newly created Amazon Advertising account with an existing dataset?\n\nAssociating a newly created Amazon Advertising\u00a0account with the existing DataSet:\n\n\n 1. Visit the\n **DataSets**\n page in the Data Center.\n\n2. Locate your existing DataSet\u00a0that you want to\u00a0associate with a new Amazon Advertising\u00a0account.\n\n\n 3. The DataSet details will appear.\n\n\n 4.\u00a0Click\n **Settings**\n tab.\u00a0You will be redirected to the Connector's Credentials section.\n\n\n 5. Here, you can select your new Amazon Advertising\u00a0account if it's already created, or you can create a new account to associate with your selected DataSet.\n\n\n 6. Click\n **Save**\n .\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nAmazon Advertising\n\nAccount\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nAmazon Advertising\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\n\nAmazon Advertising\n\nConnector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if you have existing Amazon Advertising accounts in Domo) to open the Amazon OAuth screen where you can enter your Amazon email address and password. Once you have entered valid Amazon credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nAmazon Advertising\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n\nIf you are already logged into Amazon when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n\n*Add account**\n\n. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the current Amazon account.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Profile\n  |\n Select the profile you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect the Amazon Advertising report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Entities Reports\n  |\n Retrieves a list of various entities like adGroups, campaigns, negative keywords etc, for the given advertising type.\n  |\n|\n Performance Report\n  |\n Returns details about the performance of adGroups, campaigns, productAds, etc. for the given advertising type.\n  |\n|\n List Portfolios\n  |\n Retrieves a list of portfolios.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Advertising Type\n  |\n Select whether you want to retrieve data for brands, products, displays, or DSP campaigns.\n  |\n|\n Record Type\n  |\n Select the record type you want to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n State filters\n  |\n Select desired state filters.\n  |\n|\n Tactic for Specified Advertising Filter\n  |\n Select the advertising tactic you want to filter your data by.\n  |\n|\n Segment by Search Terms\n  |\n Select whether you want to break down your report by search term.\n  |\n|\n Segment by Placements\n  |\n Select whether you want to break down your report by placement.\n  |\n|\n Metrics\n  |\n Select all the metrics you want to pull data for.\n  |\n|\n Dimensions\n  |\n Select the dimensions to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n DSP Report Type\n  |\n Select the DSP report type to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n DSP Metrics\n  |\n Select the DSP metrics you want to pull data for.\n  |\n|\n Import Type\n  |\n Select the import type for your data.
