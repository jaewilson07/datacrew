Connecting to Your

Amazon Advertising

Account
-----------------------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the

Amazon Advertising

Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Amazon Advertising accounts in Domo) to open the Amazon OAuth screen where you can enter your Amazon email address and password. Once you have entered valid Amazon credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new

Amazon Advertising

DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**

If you are already logged into Amazon when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click

*Add account**

. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the current Amazon account.

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


####

I received an error "An unknown scope was requested" when authenticating my Amazon account. Or, when I try to create an account it opens an OAuth window, closes it, and fails with the message "There was a problem creating your account. Please try again." What can I try?

Please verify that your app is whitelisted with Amazon. Find your "Get started with the Amazon Advertising API" email and make sure you have accepted the Amazon Advertising API License Agreement.
