Use Domo's Open FEC connector to retrieve data about calendar events, candidates, committees, and more. Use Domo's\u00a0Open FEC connector to instantly connect, visualize, and get insights from elections data. To learn more about the Open FEC API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://api.open.fec.gov/developers/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Open FEC account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Open FEC connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Open FEC account and create a DataSet, you must have your API\u00a0key generated at\n\nhttps://api.data.gov/signup/\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Open FEC Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nOpen FEC\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nOpen FEC\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter your API\u00a0key. Visit\n\nhttps://api.data.gov/signup/\n\nto generate your API key.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nOpen FEC\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Open FEC report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Calendar Events\n  |\n Returns a list of calendar events with start dates that fall between the selected dates.\n  |\n|\n Candidates\n  |\n Returns a list of candidates that can be filtered by office and political party.\n  |\n|\n Committees\n  |\n Returns information about committees and filers.

The cycle begins with an odd year and is named for its ending, even year. To see data for the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term, you will need the 'Aggregate Full Cycle' option set to true. Must use 4 digit year format.\n  |\n|\n Aggregate Full Cycle\n  |\n Select to aggregate data for a full election cycle. By default it's False.\n  |\n|\n Single Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Specific Date\n  |\n Select the specific date using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Relative Date\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for in the\n ****Days Back****\n field. Specify either today or 0, yesterday or 1, or today-7 or 7 to get data for 7 days into the past.\n  |\n|\n Date Range\n  |\n Select the specific or relative date range.\n  |\n|\n Start Date - Specific\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n End Date - Specific\n  |\n Select the last date in your date range\u00a0using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Start Date - Relative\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data from (start day).

Combine with\n ****************Start Date****************\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\u00a010\u00a0for\n ****************Start Date****************\n and\u00a05\u00a0for\n ****************End Date****************\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500000216941\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003264\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nOpen FEC Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,644\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "open_fec_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
