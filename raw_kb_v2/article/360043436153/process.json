To do this, you must first create an app in Microsoft Azure. For more information about the Microsoft Dynamics CRM API, visit their website. (\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/dynamics365/\n\n). For more information about Azure, see\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM REST connector user interface. General information for adding\n\nDataSets\n\n, setting update schedules, and editing\n\nDataSet\n\ninformation is discussed in\n\nAdding a\n\nDataSet\n\nUsing a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for:\n * Sales management\n* Marketing lead generation\n* Pipeline management\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Leads generated\n* MQL\n* MQO\n* SAO\n* Won Deals\n* Open Opportunities\n* Win Rates\n* Average Deal Size\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Salespeople, executives, etc.\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 30 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 9\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Dynamics CRM installation in order to retrieve information, you must have the following:\n\n An installed Microsoft Azure app.\n* Your Azure tenant domain. To find your tenant domain, do the following:\n\n1. Go to\n\n portal.azure.com\n\n and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.\n\t2. Select\n\t **Azure Active Directory > Properties**\n\t .\n\t3.

Go to\n\n portal.azure.com\n\n and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.\n\t2. Select\n\t **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**\n\t .\n\t3. Find your app and click on it.\n\t4. Locate the \"Application ID\" from the web app (this is the client ID).\n* The client secret for your Azure app. This is generated when you create your Azure app. To generate a new client secret, do the following:\n\n1. Go to\n\n portal.azure.com\n\n and sign in using your Microsoft credentials.\n\t2. Select\n\t **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**\n\t .\n\t3. Find your app and click on it.\n\t4.
