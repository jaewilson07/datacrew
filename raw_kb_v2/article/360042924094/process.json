You can add another layer of drill path to this view so that the user can drill to see additional details, and so on.\n                       \n\n                        Users can drill down into cards from the Details view or the Page view. However, drilldown is\n                        \n                         only\n                        \n                        available in the Page view when Domo Stories Dashboards are enabled.

The \"bottom\" drill path layer of any chart is, by default, a table containing the data for the graph element you clicked. You can prevent drilling to the \"bottom\" drill path layer.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           The bottom-layer data table is not available when drilling down into a Card from the Page level.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        You can also drill down from one DataSet to another, as long as the second DataSet contains the same category and series columns you filtered off of in the first DataSet.

For example, if you had two DataSets that contained a column called \"Customers,\" you could create a top-level chart with \"Customers\" data using the first DataSet. Then, because you used the \"Customers\" column in the first DataSet, you could drill down to the second DataSet and filter off of the \"Customers\" column in that DataSet to see additional details.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Notes:\n                           \n\n\n                             Calculations you create using Beast Mode are inherited when you drill from one view to another using the\n                             \n                              same\n                             \n                             DataSet.

For example, if Brett, a member of the \"Western Region\" policy, goes to build a drill path on a PDP-affected card in which he is only allowed to see data for western states, his completed drill path will contain only information for those same\u00a0states.

So, for example, if your top-level view had bars for 2006, 2007, and 2008, your next layer down would filter off of the data in those rows.\n                       \n\n\n                         To add a drill path to a chart,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Click the KPI card to open the\u00a0Details\u00a0view.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                          , then select\n                          \n                           Edit Drill Path\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n                          A new page titled \"Drill Path\"\u00a0opens.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Add a view\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n                          A\u00a0view opens that is similar to the Analyzer.

The following spreadsheet records the sales of the salespeople, \"Jensen,\" \"Kohler,\" and \"Montoya,\" over a period of three days in January, with the specific amounts and customers for each sale:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The manager of the sales team wants to create a single KPI card to represent all of the information in this spreadsheet. Because there is too much information here to show in one view, she decides to implement a drill path so that viewers can drill down and see successive views of different information. In the first view, she decides to show the amounts pulled in by Jensen, Kohler, and Montoya for the date range specified. She chooses \"Vertical Stacked Bar\" as the chart type and selects the \"Salesperson,\" \"Date,\" and \"Amount\" columns to power the chart. The resulting chart appears as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The manager begins to implement a drill path in the chart using the procedure provided in\n                        \n                         Adding a drill path to a chart\n                        \n                        . For the first drill path layer, she wants to show how much sales revenue was respectively pulled from Florida and Georgia. She adds a new view, selects\u00a0Map\u00a0as the chart type, drags the \"Amount\" column into the\n                        \n                         State Value\n                        \n                        field, and drags the \"State\" column into the\n                        \n                         State Name\n                        \n                        field. Even though she already used the \"Amount\" column, she can do so again because it is a value column. If she had chosen \"Salesperson\" or \"Date\" again, however, the drill path would not function correctly. The manager then saves the new view. If a user were to open the\u00a0Details\u00a0view for the chart and click the \"Jensen\" bar for 2011-01-06, the following new view would appear:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In this view, the amounts for the two \"FL\" rows for this salesperson and date are aggregated. Hence, the value for Georgia is \"12.4k,\" the same as in the spreadsheet, but the value for Florida is \"15.86k,\" the sum of the two amounts.\n                       \n\n                        The manager decides to add a second drill path layer in which the customers for each state are shown. She goes back into the\u00a0Drill Path\u00a0screen and adds another new view. In this view, she selects \"Vertical Bar\" as the chart type and uses the \"Amount\" and \"Customer\" columns to power the chart. She does\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        select the \"State\" column because she is already filtering off of that column. She saves the new view. If a user were to open the\u00a0Details\u00a0view, click the \"Jensen\" bar for 2011-01-06 as before, then click the state of Florida, the following view would appear:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        This shows the two customers and the amounts they paid (second drill path layer) for the state of Florida (first drill path layer) for Jensen on January 6, 2011 (top-level view). If a user were to click the state of Georgia instead, only one bar would appear, because there is only one row that contains data for Jensen on January 6 for the state of Georgia.\n                       \n\n                        However, if that user were to drill down into the \"Kohler\" bar for January 8 on the top-level view, then click Georgia, two bars would appear, one for each customer.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Example 2\n                       \n\n                        Suppose \"Office Guru\" sells office supplies to customers throughout the entire United States. The sales manager has created a simple, two-column \"Top Customers\" chart that shows the top ten highest-paying customers for the last four years. The data for this chart has been gleaned from a much larger DataSet, and appears as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The resulting Vertical Bar chart appears as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The manager wants to show more detail about these customers, in particular how much they are spending on different categories and subcategories of products. This information is found in the larger DataSet. The manager decides to drill down from the original, two-column DataSet to the larger, more detailed DataSet to show this information. A section of this larger DataSet appears in the following image, with the key columns indicated.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        To drill to this second DataSet, the sales manager first opens the\n                        \n                         Edit Drill Path\n                        \n                        screen for the \"Top Customers\" chart then selects\n                        \n                         Add a view\n                        \n                        .

The manager picks a new chart type, Vertical Stacked Bar, and applies \"Sales\" to the\n                        \n                         Y Axis\n                        \n                        field, \"Product Category\" to the\n                        \n                         X Axis\n                        \n                        field, and \"Product Subcategory\" to the\n                        \n                         Series\n                        \n                        field.

For example, if you had a latitude-longitude map showing values per state and you added the same map as a drill layer, clicking any point in the country-level map would bring up a \"zoomed in\" state or region level that displayed all of the original data points from that state or region.\n                       \n\n                        Results from using this technique vary depending on the map type, your DataSet, and the specific columns you apply.\n                       \n\n                        For more information about U.S. state maps, see\n                        \n                         Latitude-Longitude Map\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Creating a Map Drill to Zip Code Using the Zips to FIPS Connector", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042924094", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
