You can do this Page by Page, or you can lock multiple Pages at once. To bulk-lock Pages, you must have a\u00a0default security role of \"Admin\" or a custom role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" privilege enabled.\n\n\n You can also lock individual Cards in a Page. When a Card is locked, only the Card owner and \"Admin\" users can perform actions such as editing the Card, creating a drill path, and connecting/updating data. You can do this Card by Card, or you can lock multiple Cards at once. To bulk-lock Cards, you must have a default security role of \"Admin\" or a custom role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" privilege enabled.\n\n\n Locked Pages also cannot be shared by users if they are not the owner or do not have an \"Admin\" default security role\u00a0or a custom role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" privilege enabled.\n\n\n Locking Pages\n---------------\n\nYou can lock single Pages by clicking the lock icon\n\nnext to the Page name. If you are not the Page owner and do not have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" privilege enabled., this icon does not appear.\n\n\n You can unlock a locked Page by clicking the lock icon a second time.\n\n*Note:**\n If you have an \"Admin\" security role or a custom role with the \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" privilege enabled., you can also lock Pages by setting them as company Pages in the\n **Company Settings**\n tab in the Admin Settings. This locks not only the content, but also the order of the Pages as they appear in the navigation bar, together with the order of any sub-Pages of those Pages. This advanced method of locking Pages is recommended for administrators setting up Pages for their employees. For non-administrator employees who want to lock personal Pages, the method described in this topic is simpler and more appropriate. For more information about locking company Pages in the Admin Settings, see\n\nAdding Company Pages\n\n.\n\nFor information about moving Cards within a Page, see\n\nRemoving Cards from a Page\n\n.\n\n\n**To lock Cards in a single Page,**\n\n.
