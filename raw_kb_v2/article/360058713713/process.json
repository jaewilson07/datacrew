Domo provides connectors that allow you to access CSV files you have uploaded to an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) server:\n\n The Domo CSV SFTP\u00a0Pull connector (formerly called the \"CSV-SFTP\" connector) allows you to access CSV files that you have uploaded to your own SFTP server.\n* The Domo CSV SFTP Advanced Security connector allows you to access CSV files from a directory or\u00a0a zip file\u00a0that you have uploaded to your own SFTP server.\n* The Domo CSV SFTP Push connector allows you to capture and process CSV files that have been uploaded to Domo's own SFTP. With this connector, Domo gives you credentials, then you push your data to Domo.\n\nThis article discusses the\n **CSV SFTP\u00a0Advanced Security**\n connector. For information about the CSV SFTP Push connector, visit\n\nCSV SFTP Push Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The CSV SFTP\u00a0Advanced Security connector is\u00a0a\u00a0\"File\" connector, meaning it\u00a0retrieves files and output\u00a0them to Domo. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this\u00a0and other File connectors by clicking\n ****File****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to CSV files in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0CSV SFTP Advanced Security connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo authenticate to the\u00a0SFTP server, you must have the following:\n\n SFTP Host name\n* SFTP Port number\n* SFTP Server Username\n* Public Key\n\n\n#####\n**To obtain your Public Key:**\n\n\n* Enter the host name, port number, and SFTP server username then click\n **Generate Key**\n .\n* Copy the Public key on to the SFTP server.\n\nYou must also whitelist the IP addresses from the following article on the server:\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to CSV\u00a0Files\n-------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes for\u00a0the\u00a0CSV SFTP\u00a0Advanced Pull connector.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your SFTP server. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the name of the SFTP host you want to connect to. This\n *must*\n begin with\u00a0sftp://. For example:\n\nsftp://hostname\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for your SFTP server.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to\u00a0authenticate to the SFTP server.\n  |\n\nAfter entering the host, port, and username, click the\n **Generate Key**\n button. Copy your\n **Public Key**\n to the SFTP server.\n\n\n Looking to upload a CSV file but do not have an SFTP server?
