If you want, you can change this number to show more or fewer value gridlines.\n\n\ufeff\n\nShow...\n  |\n if you want...\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Fewer\n  |\n If you want to show relative values so users can distinguish overall trends, show fewer gridlines so your chart appears less cluttered (with large \"gaps\" between reference values).\n  |\n|\n More\n  |\n If you want to show approximate values so users can match up elements with reference values, show more gridlines.\n  |\n\nThe following example shows a chart with eight value scale gridlines, which may make the chart seem cluttered; however, it may make identifying identify the values of each bar easier.\n\n*To change the maximum number of value scale gridlines in a chart,**\n\n. Open the Analyzer\u00a0for the chart you want to edit.\n2. In\n **Chart Properties**\n , click\n **Value Scale**\n .\n3. Enter the desired maximum number of gridlines in the\n **Max Gridlines**\n field.\n\nNote that this number does\n *not*\n necessarily determine the number of gridlines that appear in the chart.
