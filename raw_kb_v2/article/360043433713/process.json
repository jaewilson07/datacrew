In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This connector is nearly the same as the\n\nBox Analytics Advanced Connector\n\n. The difference is that\u00a0the advanced version\u00a0allows more filtering options for the \"File and Folder\"\u00a0and \"Enterprise Events\"\u00a0reports.\n\nThis topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Box Analytics connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is best suited for IT Enterprise Admins who need to gain insight on how their company Box account is being used.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n The connector gives great insight into how often users are logging in, downloading, viewing, and other general adoption metrics.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n IT Administrator\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 10 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 7\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nThe data that comes from this connector is a stream of events occurring in your company Box account. While helpful, the data may take a while to analyze and understand before becoming useful.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Box account and create a Box Analytics DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The email address you use to log into your Box account.\n* The password you use to log into your Box account.\n\n\n**Note:**\n While anyone with a Box account can use this connector, if you are not an Admin you will only be able to see one report about your own usage, which may not be helpful.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Box Account\n---------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Box Analytics connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n The Domo Box Analytics connector uses OAuth to connect to Box. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Box Analytics accounts in Domo)\u00a0to open the Box OAuth screen where you can enter the email address and password associated with your Box account. After you have entered valid Box credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Box Analytics\u00a0DataSet.\n\n\n You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane includes a single menu from which you select a Box Analytics report.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect the Box Analytics report. The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nFile and Folder Report\n\n|\n\nReturns details of files and folders in the account.\n\n|\n|\n\nUser Report\n\n|\n\nReturns details about account users. For an individual user, this includes\u00a0only the user's\u00a0own user information and content. For an enterprise administrator, this includes both the individual user's information\u00a0along with that of\u00a0any other users in the administrator\u2019s enterprise account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnterprise Event Report\n\n|\n\nReturns the full history of an enterprise account.\n\n|\n|\n\nSingle User Event Report\n\n|\n\nReturns a list of all the events relevant to an individual\u00a0user's Box account.\n\n|\n\n\n |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nVerify that you are an Admin in your company's Box instance. Otherwise you will not be able to pull much data using this connector.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n How do I know that my Box account credentials are secure?\n\nThe login process uses the OAuth process, so your Box credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDatasets should be set to update once every 15 minutes.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nBox allows roughly 10 queries per second for each user. Note that a single dataset run may require multiple queries.\n\n####\n Why am I not able to pull maximum data?\n\nMake sure that you are an Admin in your company's Box instance. Otherwise you may not be able to pull much data using this connector.\n\n####\n What is the difference between the Box Analytics connector and the Box Advanced Analytics connector?\n\nBox Analytics Advanced connector allows more filtering options for 'File and Folder' and 'Enterprise Events' reports.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433713\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003543\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBox Analytics Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,685\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "box_analytics_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
