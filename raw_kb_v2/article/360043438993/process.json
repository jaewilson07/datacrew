Publication Groups are special security groups controlled within\u00a0the Publication Groups view. Members of a Publication Group see only the Pages and Cards authorized for the group.

The row value filter is a value in the specified data column filter. For example, if the data column filter is \"Region,\" values might be \"West,\" \"Northeast,\" and \"Southeast.\"\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          Inclusive or exclusive access\n                          \n\n                          Currently, you can configure the Publication Groups view to provide inclusive and/or exclusive access for internal enterprise users, or exclusive access for external users (those without Domo accounts).\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Access Type\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Domo Account Type\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Description\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Inclusive\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Internal\n                             \n\n\n\n                              You can authorize users in Domo to access Publication Groups Pages and Cards, in addition to seeing other Pages and Cards.

If the DataSet values are the same as values of an existing DataSet, Domo applies any existing row value filters to the additional data column filter. You can specify additional row value filters or any differing values.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        In Domo, users create Pages and Cards that they want to share in the Publication Groups view.\n                       \n\n                        How the Publication Groups view works for a user\n                       \n\n                        A user with membership in a Publication Group first logs in to Domo.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n\n                           If the user has an external account, he or she can access the Publication Group by navigating to\n                           \n                            domain-ss.domo.com\n                           \n                           where\u00a0domain-ss\u00a0is their company domain, then connecting using the implemented Single Sign-On.
