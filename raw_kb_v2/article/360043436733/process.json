These instructions show you how to do this using the FileZilla SFTP client (\n\nhttps://filezilla-project.org\n\n). For instructions about uploading files using other SFTP clients, read the documentation for your chosen client or do a Google search.\n\n\n****To send an Excel file to a Domo SFTP server using FileZilla,****\n\n. Configure the Excel connector in Domo by following the instructions under\n\nConnecting to Your Excel File\n\n.\n2. Move your\n\n.pem\n\nfile into a directory on your machine.\n\n\n In this example we use the\n\n/sftp\n\ndirectory.\n3. Create a Excel file in the\n\n/sftp\n\ndirectory with the same name as the new DataSet's ID (which you can find in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in the Details view for the DataSet).\n\n\n For example, if your DataSet ID was\u00a0cb4ba6a0-0934-440f-8572-1253b9f7525a, the Excel filename would be\n\ncb4ba6a0-0934-440f-8572-1253b9f7525a.Excel\n\n.\n4. In FileZilla, create a new site in the Site Manager.\n5. In the\n ****General****\n tab, configure settings as follows:\n\n\n For this setting...\n  |\n ...do this\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the\n ****Host name****\n URL found in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in the Details view for the DataSet.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter\u00a022.\n  |\n|\n Protocol\n  |\n Select\n ****SFTP****\n .\n  |\n|\n Logon Type\n  |\n Select\n ****Key file****\n .\n  |\n|\n User\n  |\n Enter the value next to\n ****User name****\n in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in the details view for the DataSet.\n  |\n|\n Key file\n  |\n Locate your\n\n.pem\n\nkey in the file browser.\n  |\n6. Open the connection to the site you just configured.\n7. Drag the Excel file you want to upload from the\n **Local file**\n window to the\n **Remote site**\n window.\n8. Close the connection or quit FileZilla.\n\nYou should now see the file being uploaded into Domo.\n\n##\n Uploading an Excel File Using the Command Line\n\nYou can send an Excel file to a Domo SFTP server using a command line client. These instructions are specific to Mac/Linux systems and may not work on Windows.\n\n\n****To send an Excel file to a Domo SFTP server using the command line,****\n\n. Configure the Excel connector in Domo by following the instructions under\n\nConnecting to Your Excel File\n\n.\n2. Move your\n\n.pem\n\nfile into a directory on your machine.\n\n\n In this example we use the\n\n/sftp\u00a0directory\n\n.\n3. Create a Excel file in the\n\n/sftp\n\ndirectory with the same name as the new DataSet's ID (which you can find in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in the details view for the DataSet).\n\n\n For example, if your DataSet ID was\u00a0cb4ba6a0-0934-440f-8572-1253b9f7525a, the Excel filename would be\n\ncb4ba6a0-0934-440f-8572-1253b9f7525a.Excel\n\n.\n4. In the\u00a0/sftp\u00a0directory, connect to the SFTP server using this command:\n\n\n`sftp \u2013i\n **domosftpkey**\n .\n **pem**\n**username**\n @\n **mycompany**\n .\n\nimport.domo.com`\n\n\n where\n **username**\n is the value corresponding to\n ****User name****\n in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab,\n **domosftpkey.pem**\n is the name of your key, and\n **mycompany**\n is your Domo domain (i.e. the portion of the URL of your Domo instance immediately following\u00a0http://).\n5. Use this command to upload the Excel file:\n\n\n`put\u00a0cb4ba6a0-0934-440f-8572-1253b9f7525a.Excel`\n6. Exit the server by entering\u00a0quit.\n\n\n When you exit the server, you will see your file being processed in Domo.\n\nThere is a possibility you will see the following message when you try to connect to the server:\n\nIf this occurs, run the following command then try connecting again:\n\n\n`chmod 600 /sftp/\n **domosftpkey.pem**`\n\n\n where\n **domosftpkey.pem**\n is the name of your key.\n\n##\n Uploading a Excel File Using a Third-Party Service\n\nYou can send an Excel file to a Domo SFTP server using any of various third-party services. These instructions show you how to deliver analytics reports using Adobe Analytics. For instructions about uploading files using other services, peruse the documentation for those services or do a Google search.\n\n\n****To send an Adobe Analytics Excel file to a Domo SFTP server,****\n\n. Configure the Excel connector in Domo by following the instructions under\n\nConnecting to Your Excel File\n\n. Make sure you set the following options:\n\n* Under\n\t ****Generate or Select Key****\n\t , choose the\n\t ****Use my own key****\n\t option. Then paste the RSA public key you received from Adobe in the text field.\n\t* Under\n\t ****Parsing Options****\n\t ...\n\n\t+ Set the delimiter to\n\t\t ****Comma****\n\t\t .\n\t\t+ Leave\n\t\t ****Includes Header Row****\n\t\t checked unless you have it set up to not include one in Adobe.\n2. Switch to Adobe Analytics and log into your account.\n3. Navigate to\n ****Tools > Data Warehouse****\n .\n4. In the\n ****Data Warehouse Request****\n tab, enter all the parameters needed to define the report you want to send to Domo. These parameters include\n ****Request Name****\n ,\n ****Reporting Date****\n ,\n ****Segments****\n ,\n ****Items****\n ,\n ****Breakdowns****\n ,\n ****Metrics****\n , etc.\n5. In the\n ****Schedule Delivery****\n section at the bottom of the page, click\n ****Advanced Delivery Options****\n .\n6. Set delivery options as follows:\n\n\n|\n For this option...\n  |\n ...do this\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report file name\n  |\n Select\n ****Custom****\n , then enter the Domo DataSet ID in the text field with a\u00a0.Excelextension.\n  |\n|\n Report Format\n  |\n Select\n ****Excel****\n .\n  |\n|\n Report Destination\n  |\n Select\n ****FTP****\n . Then enter information in the fields as follows:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n sftp://\n **hostname**\n (as listed on the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in Domo; for example\n\nsftp://modocorp.import.domo.com\n\n)\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n 22\n  |\n|\n Directory\n  |\n Enter the\n ****Username****\n value found in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in Domo.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the\n ****Username****\n value found in the\n ****How to Upload****\n tab in Domo.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Leave this blank. Adobe will use the RSA public key you entered in step 1 above.\n  |\n\n\n Optionally, you can also click the\n ****Scheduling Options****\n tab to specify a one-time immediate delivery or a recurring schedule.\n  |\n7. Once you have specified all advanced delivery options, click\n ****Send****\n .\n\n\n You are taken back to the\n ****Data Warehouse Request****\n page.\n8. Click\n ****Request this Report****\n to save all your settings.\n\nAdobe now queues the report and delivers it to Domo when ready. It may take some time for Adobe to complete the request.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436733\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003927\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMicrosoft Excel SFTP Push Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,917\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "microsoft_excel_sftp_push_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "file_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaowGAC"}]}
