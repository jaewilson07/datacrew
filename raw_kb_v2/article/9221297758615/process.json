Users can store data in collections, update documents, update collection schema, add filters at the document level, and manage permissions. It is possible to perform all these tasks via API calls. To learn more about using APIs with AppDB, see\n\nAppDB API\n\nin our developer docs.\n\n\n The AppDB Admin interface allows you to access AppDB and perform tasks from Domo web.\n\n\n Accessing AppDB Admin\n-----------------------\n\nFollow these steps to access AppDB Admin.\n\n\n 1. From the Domo navigation header, go to\n **Appstore**\n .\n\n\n The Domo Appstore displays.\n\n\n 2. In the left side rail, select\n\n*AppDB Admin**\n .\n\n\n The AppDB Admin interface displays. The default landing page is\n **My Collections**\n and the default Filter is\n **Owned by**\n the current user.\n\n\n In the\n **Shared with me**\n section, you can view all the collections that have been shared with you by other users.\n\n###\n Searching and Filters\n\nTo find a specific collection, enter a keyword in the\n **Search**\n bar.\n\n\n You can select\n\n*Add Filters**\n to apply other Filters and narrow down the list of search results.\n\n\n Remove a Filter by selecting\n **X**\n for that Filter.\n\nCreating a Collection\n-----------------------\n\n1. From the AppDB Admin landing page, select\n **Create a Collection**\n .\n\n\n You are prompted to enter a\n **Collection Name**\n and optional\n **Datastore Name**\n .\n\n*Note:**\n If you add a Datastore Name when creating a collection, a datastore is created in Domo for that collection. This can be helpful because it creates another possible keywords to search for if you remember the datastore name, but not the name of the collection. The datastore name displays in the\n **App Name**\n column of your collection.\n\n\n 2. Select\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n The collection Details page displays.\n\n\n Collection Details\n--------------------\n\nThe collection Details page has three tabs:\n **Data Explorer**\n ,\n **Configuration**\n , and\n **Permissions**\n . The\n **Data Explorer**\n tab is open by default.\n\n###\n\nData Explorer\n\nData Explorer allows you to create, modify, and query documents in the collection.\n\n*Creating a Document**\n\n1. Select\n **+ New Document**\n .\n\n\n The\n **New Document**\n modal displays.\n\n2. Specify the content of your new document in a JSON format.\n\n*Note:**\n If the collection schema has been defined, the modal prepopulates the default value.\n\n\n 3. Select\n **Create**\n .\n\n*Modifying a Document**\n\n1. Select the triple-dot menu beside the document.\n\n\n The document options display.\n\n2. Select the option that you want.\n\n Selecting\n **Edit**\n allows you to modify the document's content.\n* Selecting\n **Copy**\n duplicates the document.\n* Selecting\n **Sync**\n displays the most recent version of the document.\n* Selecting\n **Delete**\n deletes the document.\n\n\n**Querying and Filters**\n\n1. To query on a certain item in the data, locate the\n **Filters**\n section in\n **Data Explorer**\n and select\n **+ Add New**\n .\n\n\n A blank Filter displays.\n\n\n 2. Select a field to filter on.\n\n\n 3. Select logic.\n\n\n 4. Enter the query term.\n\n\n 5. Select\n **Apply**\n .\n\nThe Filter results display on the right side of the screen.\n\n\n You can delete a Filter by selecting\n\n*Delete**\n beside the Filter fields.\n\n*Sorting Results with Aggregations**\n\nYou can sort the results of your Filter by using\n **Aggregations**\n .\n\n\n 1. In\n **Query Builder**\n under\n **Aggregations**\n , select\n **+ Add New**\n .\n\n\n The aggregation fields display.\n\n\n 2. Select the\u00a0aggregation method.\n\n\n 3.
