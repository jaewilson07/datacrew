For more information about the Associated Press API, see\n\n\n https://developer.ap.org/api-console\n\n\n .\n\nThe Associated Press connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou create an Associated Press\u00a0DataSet in the\n **Data Center**\n . This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is useful for pulling current news headlines into cards in Domo.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n This connector provides a qualitative list of news stories by category. As such there are not many metrics that can be pulled. However, some users may want a count of headlines by category or the results of specific topic mentions.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Executive\n* Director\n* Manager\n* Analyst\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n A few minutes at most\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 1\n  |\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n None.
