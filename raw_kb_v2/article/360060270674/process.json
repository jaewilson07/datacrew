Use the Google Ads connector to retrieve performance reports about your accounts, ads, campaigns, budgets, and many more.\n\nFor more information about the Ads API, see\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/adword...s/guides/start\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Ads OAuth connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Google Ads data using this connector,\n\nyou must have your Google credentials (email address and password).\n\nConnecting to Google Ads Account\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google Ads OAuth Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Google Ads OAuth connector uses OAuth to connect to Google. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if you have existing Google Ads accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can select the account you want to connect to. After selecting an account, specify the password for that account. After you have entered a valid password, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Google Ads OAuth DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into\u00a0Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of\u00a0the currently active Google account.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields and menus you can use to configure your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Google Ads OAuth report type to run.

Combine with\n ********Start Date********\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\u00a010\u00a0for\n ********Start Date********\n and\u00a05\u00a0for\n ********End Date********\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n This connector is not working for me. Are there any other ways to bring my AdWords data into Domo?\n\nIf this connector does not bring your data into Domo, try using one of the following Domo connectors:\n\n\n Google Ads via Google BigQuery Service Connector, Google BigQuery Service Connector, or Google Sheets Connector.\n\nGoogle Ads Connector\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need your Google credentials.\n\n###\n How do I know that my login credentials are secure?\n\nThe login process uses the OAuth process, so your Google credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n###\n Can I use the same account to create multiple datasets?\n\nYes\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360060270674\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003252\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle Ads Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,109\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_ads_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
