**Important:**
 Google will sunset their Adwords API on April 27th 2022 in favor of their Google Ads API.


 As a result, Domo will deprecate its Google Ads connector (com.domo.connector.adwords.oauth) which relies on the Adwords API.  See

Google Ads Connector Deprecation

for more information.


 Google Ads, formerly Google Adwords, is an online advertising service where advertisers pay to display brief ads to web users. Use the Google Ads connector to retrieve performance reports about your accounts, ads, campaigns, budgets, and many more.

For more information about the Ads API, see

https://developers.google.com/adword...s/guides/start

.


 This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Ads OAuth connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Google Ads data using this connector,

you must have your Google credentials (email address and password).

Connecting to Google Ads Account
----------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Google Ads OAuth Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Google Ads OAuth connector uses OAuth to connect to Google. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Google Ads accounts in Domo) to open the Google OAuth screen where you can select the account you want to connect to. After selecting an account, specify the password for that account. After you have entered a valid password, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Google Ads OAuth DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Google when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the currently active Google account.

 FAQs
------


####
 This connector is not working for me. Are there any other ways to bring my AdWords data into Domo?

If this connector does not bring your data into Domo, try using one of the following Domo connectors:


 Google Ads via Google BigQuery Service Connector, Google BigQuery Service Connector, or Google Sheets Connector.

Google Ads Connector


####
 What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?

You need your Google credentials.

###
 How do I know that my login credentials are secure?

The login process uses the OAuth process, so your Google credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.

###
 How often can the data be updated?

As often as needed.

###
 Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?

No

###
 Can I use the same account to create multiple datasets?
