The Domo Salesforce Desk connector integrates Domo with Salesforce Desk to extract data from the Salesforce Desk API. The connector\u00a0allows you to retrieve data about articles, cases, customers, and\u00a0many other Salesforce Desk components. To learn more about the Salesforce Desk API, visit their website. (\n\nhttp://dev.desk.com/API/using-the-api/#general\n\n)\n\n\n The Salesforce Desk connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Salesforce Desk account\u00a0in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Salesforce Desk connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Salesforce Desk\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Salesforce Desk customer ID.\u00a0You can find your customer ID in the URL of your company's Salesforce Desk instance. For example, in the Salesforce Desk URL\n **https://yourcompany.desk.com**\n , the company ID is\n\nyourcompany\n\n.\n* The email address you use to log in to your Salesforce Desk account.\n* The password you use to log in to your Salesforce Desk account.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Salesforce Desk Account\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Salesforce Desk\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a single field where you enter your Salesforce Desk company ID.\u00a0You are then taken to the\u00a0Salesforce Desk OAuth page where you are required to enter your\u00a0email address\u00a0and password. Once you have entered valid\u00a0Salesforce Desk credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Salesforce Desk DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select\u00a0a Salesforce Desk report.
