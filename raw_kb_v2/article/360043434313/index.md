Intro
---------

Salesforce Desk is an online customer service software and support ticket help desk application for small businesses and fast-growing companies. The Domo Salesforce Desk connector integrates Domo with Salesforce Desk to extract data from the Salesforce Desk API. The connector allows you to retrieve data about articles, cases, customers, and many other Salesforce Desk components. To learn more about the Salesforce Desk API, visit their website. (

)


 The Salesforce Desk connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Salesforce Desk account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Salesforce Desk connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Salesforce Desk account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Salesforce Desk customer ID. You can find your customer ID in the URL of your company's Salesforce Desk instance. For example, in the Salesforce Desk URL
 **https://yourcompany.desk.com**
 , the company ID is

yourcompany

.
* The email address you use to log in to your Salesforce Desk account.
* The password you use to log in to your Salesforce Desk account.
