Lollipop graphs are essentially modified Bar graphs in which the bars are represented as thin lines so you can fit more in a small area, with small circles to represent mouse-over points. There are eight types of Lollipop graphs in Domo, all of them modified versions of familiar Bar and Line Bar graphs. For more information about these graphs, see
