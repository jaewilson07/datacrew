Unit strings follow these rules:\n                           \n\n                            1. Most SI (Metric) and Imperial units are supported. Imperial units are defined in terms of their SI counterparts. Imperial units of length, area, and mass/weight are mostly agreed upon internationally; the ton is an exception. Units of volume, like the gallon, also differ between the UK and the USA. When such differences arise, USA customary values (e.g. the short ton; 2000 avoirdupois pounds) are used.\n                           \n\n                            2. Units may be written out in full, and optionally pluralized. Metric units may have metric prefixes, and computing units may have metric or binary prefixes. Examples: ''feet'', ''year'', ''kilowatt'', ''megabyte'', ''mebibyte''\n                           \n\n                            3. Units may be abbreviated. Metric and binary prefixes on abbreviated units must also be abbreviated. Abbreviated units are case-sensitive. Examples: ''mi'' (miles), ''KiBps'' (kibibytes per second), ''uPa'' (micropascals)\n                           \n\n                            4. Units may be exponentiated using the caret ''^'' or by ending a unit's name with a number. Exponents may be negative to indicate inversion of the unit. Units may also be prefixed with ''cu''/''cubic'' or ''sq''/''square'', followed by a space '' '' or hyphen ''-'', which are equivalent to the exponents ''3'' and ''2'', respectively. Examples: ''sq ft'' (square feet), ''m3'' (cubic meters), ''s^-1'' (inverse seconds; hertz)\n                           \n\n                            5. Units may be divided using the forward slash ''/'' character or the word '' per ''. Examples: ''miles per hour'', ''metres/second/second'' (meters per second squared; acceleration)\n                           \n\n                            6. Units may be multiplied using the asterisk ''*'' or by being combined with a hyphen ''-'' or space. The asterisk follows normal multiplication order of operations, while the hyphen or space form have the highest precedence, as though the combined units were a single unit name. Examples: ''N*m'' (newton meters; joules), ''half-gal'' (half gallons), ''kilogram-meters/second2'' (kilogram meters per second squared; newtons)\n                           \n\n                            7. Parentheses may be used to affect the order of operations of exponentiation, multiplication, and division. Examples: ''(m/s)^2'' (meters squared per second squared; acceleration of area)\n                           \n\n                            8. Units whose names or abbreviations consist of more than one word can be written with an underscore ''_'' separator or simply without the space. Examples: ''fluid_ounce'', ''floz'' (fluid ounce), ''poundforce'', ''astronomical_unit''\n                           \n\n                            Units must be conmensurable to be converted; they must have the same dimensions. There are five supported dimensional values: Time, length, mass, electric current, and information. Units may have a positive, negative, or zero number of dimensions in any of these values. Some units have zero dimensions in all categories; these units are raw quantities like ''dozen'' or ''half''. ''meters / second'' has one positive length dimension, and one negative time dimension; it is a unit of velocity. The ''gallon'' has three positive length dimensions; it is a unit of volume. These can be converted to ''miles / hour'' and ''cubic inches'', respectively, because they have the same dimensions. Attempting to convert between units that have different dimensions, like from ''seconds'' to ''miles'', results in an error.\n                           \n\n                            Note that due to the nature of DOUBLE arithmetic, results may appear inexact. The ROUND() function may be used to correct results in these cases.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            CONVERT_UNIT(expr,from_unit,to_unit)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            COS\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Returns the cosine of X, where X is given in radians.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            COS(X)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            COSH\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Returns the hyperbolic cosine of X.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            COSH(X)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            COT\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Returns the cotangent of X.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            COT(X)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            CRC32\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Computes a cyclic redundancy check value and returns a 32-bit unsigned value.
