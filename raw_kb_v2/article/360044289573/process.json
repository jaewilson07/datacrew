Read the\n\n\n Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL\n\n\n article before converting mission-critical Magic ETL DataFlows.\n **Failure to do so may risk an unintended change to your DataFlow\u2019s behavior.**\n\n\n Supported Functions\n=====================\n\nThe following sections give examples of the available functions that can be used inside of Magic ETL. However, for a complete list you will need to refer to the Functions list inside of the Formula Editor as seen here:\n\n\n**Important:**\n While the Formula Editor looks similar to the Beast Mode editor, they are not the same. You can copy any Beast Mode you have made into the Formula Editor and it will work, but not all of the functions allowed in the Formula Editor will work inside of a Beast Mode. This is due to the increased processing power available to DataFlows versus Analyzer.\n\nAggregate Functions\n=====================\n\n\n|\n**Function Name**\n |\n**Description**\n |\n**Example**\n |\n|\n APPROXIMATE COUNT (DISTINCT)\n  |\n Returns the approximate count of a number of unique values in a column.\n  |\n APPROXIMATE\\_COUNT\\_DISTINCT(X)\n  |\n|\n CORR\n  |\n Returns the correlation coefficient of independent variable x and dependent variable y.

NULL values are ignored. It is an aggregate function.\n\n\n AVG() returns NULL if there were no matching rows.\n  |\n AVG(expr)\n  |\n|\n CBRT\n  |\n Returns the cube root of X. If X is negative, NaN is returned.\n  |\n CBRT(X)\n  |\n|\n CEIL\n  |\n Returns the smallest integer value not less than X. Alias for CEILING().\n  |\n CEIL(X)\n  |\n|\n CEILING\n  |\n Returns the smallest integer value not less than X.\n  |\n CEILING(X)\n  |\n|\n CONV\n  |\n Converts numbers between different number bases. Returns a string representation of the number N, converted from base from\\_base to base to\\_base.\n  |\n CONV(N,from\\_base,to\\_base)\n  |\n|\n CONVERT\\_UNIT\n  |\n Converts expr from from\\_unit to to\\_unit. expr will be converted to type DOUBLE if it is not already, and the result always has type DOUBLE.\n\n\n from\\_unit and to\\_unit are strings describing conmensurable units in English, e.g. ''cubic feet'' and ''liters'', or ''mph'' and ''m/s''. Unit strings follow these rules:\n\n\n 1. Most SI (Metric) and Imperial units are supported. Imperial units are defined in terms of their SI counterparts. Imperial units of length, area, and mass/weight are mostly agreed upon internationally; the ton is an exception. Units of volume, like the gallon, also differ between the UK and the USA. When such differences arise, USA customary values (e.g. the short ton; 2000 avoirdupois pounds) are used.\n\n\n 2. Units may be written out in full, and optionally pluralized. Metric units may have metric prefixes, and computing units may have metric or binary prefixes. Examples: ''feet'', ''year'', ''kilowatt'', ''megabyte'', ''mebibyte''\n\n\n 3. Units may be abbreviated. Metric and binary prefixes on abbreviated units must also be abbreviated. Abbreviated units are case-sensitive. Examples: ''mi'' (miles), ''KiBps'' (kibibytes per second), ''uPa'' (micropascals)\n\n\n 4. Units may be exponentiated using the caret ''^'' or by ending a unit's name with a number. Exponents may be negative to indicate inversion of the unit. Units may also be prefixed with ''cu''/''cubic'' or ''sq''/''square'', followed by a space '' '' or hyphen ''-'', which are equivalent to the exponents ''3'' and ''2'', respectively. Examples: ''sq ft'' (square feet), ''m3'' (cubic meters), ''s^-1'' (inverse seconds; hertz)\n\n\n 5. Units may be divided using the forward slash ''/'' character or the word '' per ''. Examples: ''miles per hour'', ''metres/second/second'' (meters per second squared; acceleration)\n\n\n 6. Units may be multiplied using the asterisk ''\\*'' or by being combined with a hyphen ''-'' or space. The asterisk follows normal multiplication order of operations, while the hyphen or space form have the highest precedence, as though the combined units were a single unit name. Examples: ''N\\*m'' (newton meters; joules), ''half-gal'' (half gallons), ''kilogram-meters/second2'' (kilogram meters per second squared; newtons)\n\n\n 7. Parentheses may be used to affect the order of operations of exponentiation, multiplication, and division. Examples: ''(m/s)^2'' (meters squared per second squared; acceleration of area)\n\n\n 8. Units whose names or abbreviations consist of more than one word can be written with an underscore ''\\_'' separator or simply without the space. Examples: ''fluid\\_ounce'', ''floz'' (fluid ounce), ''poundforce'', ''astronomical\\_unit''\n\n\n Units must be conmensurable to be converted; they must have the same dimensions. There are five supported dimensional values: Time, length, mass, electric current, and information. Units may have a positive, negative, or zero number of dimensions in any of these values. Some units have zero dimensions in all categories; these units are raw quantities like ''dozen'' or ''half''. ''meters / second'' has one positive length dimension, and one negative time dimension; it is a unit of velocity. The ''gallon'' has three positive length dimensions; it is a unit of volume. These can be converted to ''miles / hour'' and ''cubic inches'', respectively, because they have the same dimensions. Attempting to convert between units that have different dimensions, like from ''seconds'' to ''miles'', results in an error.\n\n\n Note that due to the nature of DOUBLE arithmetic, results may appear inexact. The ROUND() function may be used to correct results in these cases.\n  |\n CONVERT\\_UNIT(expr,from\\_unit,to\\_unit)\n  |\n|\n COS\n  |\n Returns the cosine of X, where X is given in radians.\n  |\n COS(X)\n  |\n|\n COSH\n  |\n Returns the hyperbolic cosine of X.\n  |\n COSH(X)\n  |\n|\n COT\n  |\n Returns the cotangent of X.\n  |\n COT(X)\n  |\n|\n CRC32\n  |\n Computes a cyclic redundancy check value and returns a 32-bit unsigned value.

Note that \u03c0 radians equals 180 degrees.\n\n\n This is the converse of the DEGREES() function.\n  |\n RADIANS(X)\n  |\n|\n RAND\n  |\n Returns a random DOUBLE precision floating point value v in the range 0 <= v < 1.0. If a constant integer argument N is specified, it is used as the seed value, which produces a repeatable sequence of column values.\n  |\n RAND(), RAND(N)\n  |\n|\n ROUND\n  |\n Rounds the argument X to D decimal places. D defaults to 0 if not specified.\n  |\n ROUND(X), ROUND(X,D)\n  |\n|\n RPAD\n  |\n Returns the string str, right-padded with the string padstr to a length of len characters.

Buckets are numbered from 1 to N, where N is the number of buckets. Values that fall outside the range are put in overflow buckets with numbers 0 and N + 1.\n\n\n Be aware that bucket ranges are inclusive of their minimum bound and exclusive of their maximum bound. So WIDTH\\_BUCKET(100, 0, 100, 4) = 5, the overflow bucket. Also note that min may be less than max, in which case bucket minimums are larger than bucket maximums. So WIDTH\\_BUCKET(100, 100, 0, 4) = 1, the first bucket.\n  |\n WIDTH\\_BUCKET(expr, min, max, bucket\\_count)\n  |\n\n\n Statistical Functions\n=======================\n\n\n|\n**Function Name**\n |\n**Description**\n |\n**Example**\n |\n|\n ANOVAF\n  |\n Returns the F-value of a one-way Analysis of Variance of the samples.

This is the same as CASE WHEN expr1 = expr2 THEN NULL ELSE expr1 END.\n  |\n NULLIF(expr1,expr2)\n  |\n\n\n String Functions\n==================\n\n\n|\n**Function**\n |\n**Description**\n |\n**Example**\n |\n|\n CHAR\\_LENGTH\n  |\n Returns the length of the given string argument, measured in characters. A multi-byte character counts as a single character. This means that for a string containing five two-byte characters, LENGTH(), whereas CHAR\\_LENGTH() returns 5. If the argument is NULL, it returns NULL.\n\n\n If the argument is not a string value, it is converted into a string.\n  |\n CHAR\\_LENGTH(str)\n  |\n|\n CONCAT\n  |\n Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments. May have one or more arguments. All arguments are converted to strings.\n\n\n CONCAT() returns NULL if any argument is NULL.\n  |\n CONCAT(str1,str2,...)\n  |\n|\n DYNACAST\n  |\n Returns the value of expr converted to the same type as type\\_expr. type\\_expr is not evaluated; it is only used to determine the type to which expr should be converted. In most cases, type\\_expr be a column reference.\n  |\n DYNACAST(expr, type\\_expr)\n  |\n|\n GROUP\\_CONCAT\n  |\n Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments, separated by the separator, for the whole group. May have one or more arguments, plus the optional separator. If not set, the separator is the comma character '',''. All arguments are converted to strings.\n\n\n It is an aggregate function.\n\n\n GROUP\\_CONCAT() returns null if there were no matching rows.\n\n*Note:**\n The GROUP\\_CONCAT function does not support \u201cORDER BY\u201d or \"DISTINCT\" as part of the expression in Magic ETL v2.\n\n|\n GROUP\\_CONCAT(str1,str2,...[SEPARATOR sep])\n  |\n|\n INITCAP\n  |\n Returns str with the start of every word in uppercase and all other characters in lowercase.\n  |\n INITCAP(str)\n  |\n|\n INSTR\n  |\n Returns the position of the first occurrence of substring substr in string str.\n\n\n If any argument is NULL, returns NULL.\n  |\n INSTR(str,substr)\n  |\n|\n LCASE\n  |\n LCASE() is a synonym for LOWER().\n  |\n LCASE(str)\n  |\n|\n LEFT\n  |\n Returns the leftmost len characters from the string str, or NULL if any argument is NULL.\n  |\n LEFT(str,len)\n  |\n|\n LENGTH\n  |\n Returns the length of the string str, measured in bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.

This means that for a string containing five two-byte characters, LENGTH() returns 10, whereas CHAR\\_LENGTH() returns 5.\n\n\n If str is not a string value, it is converted into a string. If str is NULL, the function returns NULL.\n  |\n LENGTH(str)\n  |\n|\n LISTAGG\n  |\n LISTAGG() is a simplified version of GROUP\\_CONCAT().

If str, pat, or repl is NULL, the return value is NULL. The optional flags argument behaves as it does in REGEXP\\_LIKE().\n  |\n REGEXP\\_REPLACE(str,pat,repl[,flags])\n  |\n|\n REPLACE\n  |\n Returns the string str with all occurrences of the string from\\_str replaced by the string to\\_str. REPLACE() performs a case-sensitive match when searching for from\\_str.\n  |\n REPLACE(str,from\\_str,to\\_str)\n  |\n|\n RIGHT\n  |\n Returns the rightmost len characters from the string str, or NULL if any argument is NULL.\n  |\n RIGHT(str,len)\n  |\n|\n SPLIT\\_PART\n  |\n Returns the Nth substring of str split by sep. If N is zero or smaller, returns null. If there are fewer than N substrings after str has been split by the given separator, returns empty string.\n\n\n Example:\n\n\n SPLIT\\_PART('a~|bc~cb|d|e', '|~', 2) = \"bc~cb\"\n  |\n SPLIT\\_PART(str,sep,N)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_CLEAN\n  |\n Replaces NULL values in str with the empty string, and removes all non-whitespace control characters. These are a subset of the operations performed by STR\\_NORMALIZE().\n  |\n STR\\_CLEAN(str)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_CONTAINS\n  |\n Returns TRUE if the string str contains the string search, FALSE if it does not, or NULL if either argument is NULL.\n  |\n STR\\_CONTAINS(str, search)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_DIGITS\n  |\n Returns a new string consisting of only the digit characters in str in the order they appear. Converse of STR\\_REMOVE\\_DIGITS().\n  |\n STR\\_DIGITS(str)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_ENDS\\_WITH\n  |\n Returns TRUE if the string str ends with the string search, FALSE if it does not, or NULL if either argument is NULL.\n  |\n STR\\_ENDS\\_WITH(str, search)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_NORMALIZE\n  |\n Normalizes str by performing the following operations:\n\n\n 1. NULL values in str are replaced with the empty string.\n\n\n 2. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are removed.\n\n\n 3. All other sequences of one or more whitespace characters are replaced with a single space ('' '').\n\n\n 4. All non-whitespace control characters are removed.\n\n\n This is the more thorough version of STR\\_CLEAN().\n  |\n STR\\_NORMALIZE(str)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_REMOVE\\_DIGITS\n  |\n Returns str with all digit characters removed. Converse of STR\\_DIGITS().\n  |\n STR\\_REMOVE\\_DIGITS(str)\n  |\n|\n STR\\_STARTS\\_WITH\n  |\n Returns TRUE if the string str starts with the string search, FALSE if it does not, or NULL if either argument is NULL.\n  |\n STR\\_STARTS\\_WITH(str, search)\n  |\n|\n STRING\n  |\n Returns the value of expr converted to a STRING. Locale, timezone, and date-format settings all affect this behavior.\n  |\n STRING(expr), CAST(expr AS STRING)\n  |\n|\n SUBSTRING\n  |\n The forms without a len argument return a substring from string str starting at position pos.\n\n\n The forms with a len argument return a substring len characters long from string str, starting at position pos.\n\n\n It is also possible to use a negative value for pos. In this case, the beginning of the substring is pos characters from the end of the string, rather than the beginning. A negative value may be used for pos in any of the forms of this function.\n\n\n By default, the position of the first character in the string from which the substring is to be extracted is reckoned as 1. If any argument is NULL, returns NULL.\n  |\n SUBSTRING(str,pos), SUBSTRING(str FROM pos), SUBSTRING(str,pos,len), SUBSTRING(str FROM pos FOR len)\n  |\n|\n UCASE\n  |\n UCASE() is a synonym for UPPER().\n  |\n UCASE(str)\n  |\n|\n UPPER\n  |\n Returns the string str with all characters changed to uppercase.\n  |\n UPPER(str)\n  |\n\n\n Date and Time Functions\n=========================\n\n\n|\n**Function**\n |\n**Description**\n |\n**Example**\n |\n|\n ADDDATE\n  |\n When invoked with the INTERVAL form of the second argument, ADDDATE() is a synonym for DATE\\_ADD().
