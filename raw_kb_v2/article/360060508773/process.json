It enhances productivity, processes, and pipelines for your sales teams. Use Domo\u2019s Zendesk Upsert Connector to compile reports about tickets, users, and more. To learn more about the Zendesk API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.zendesk.com/rest\\_api/docs/core/introduction\n\n).\n\n\n The Zendesk Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n ****Cloud App****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Zendesk account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Zendesk Upsert Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Zendesk account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username for your Zendesk account\n* The API token OR password for your Zendesk account\n* The Zendesk URL for your company\n\nTo use a password, enable API authentication using an agent's email address and password. This may already be enabled for sign-in to the Zendesk Support mobile apps.\n\n\n Zendesk recommends that you use API tokens to keep your agents' passwords safe. API tokens are managed in the Zendesk Support Admin interface at\n ****Admin > Channels > API****\n . The page lets you view, add, or delete tokens. More than one token can be active at the same time. Deleting a token deactivates it permanently.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Zendesk Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nZendesk Upsert\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nZendesk\n\naccount.

The Merge mode replaces all updated rows, while any new rows are appended. Thus, it avoids duplicate entries.\n\n\n The Zendesk connector supports the Append and Replace modes to update your datasets.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360060508773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003270\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nZendesk Upsert Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,438\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "zendesk_upsert_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
