Make sure your data is always fresh and contains the most relevant and up-to-date information. With this DomoStat's app, watch your DataSet and DataFlow success rates, get notified when DataSets fail to run, and see which DataSets are orphaned, duplicated, or broken to keep your Domo instance clean.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Video\u00a0- DomoStats DataSets and DataFlows Overview\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Requirements\n                       \n\n                        You must have Admin level access to download from the Appstore.\n                       \n\n                        Using the DomoStats App\n                       \n\n                        You can use the pre-built dashboard or build any of your own content using the DomoStats DataSets in the Data Center.
