Reporting Services includes a complete set of tools to create, manage, and deliver reports, and APIs that enable developers to integrate or extend data and report processing in custom applications. Reporting Services tools work within the Microsoft Visual Studio environment and are fully integrated with SQL Server tools and components.\u00a0To learn more about the SQL Server Reporting Services, visit their page (\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql...inated-reports\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Reporting Service connector user interface.\u00a0General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The report\u00a0service URL\n* The username and password that provide\u00a0access to the\u00a0SQL Server Reporting Service\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Reporting Service\n\nAccount\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n\n*Credentials**\n\nand\n\n*Details**\n\npanes in the Microsoft Reporting Service Connector page\n\n. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service account.\n\nThe following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report Service URL\n  |\n Enter the report service URL.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username\u00a0to\u00a0access the\u00a0SQL Server Reporting Service.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password to\u00a0access the\u00a0SQL Server Reporting Service.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Microsoft Reporting Service DataSet.\n\nYou can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\n\n This pane contains menus for selecting and configuring the report and its parameters.\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report Path\n  |\n Select report from the list.\n  |\n|\n Parameters\n  |\n Select parameter(s).\n  |\n|\n Parameters Helper\n  |\n To modify query, please replace the placeholders with the appropriate values.\n\n\n Example:\u00a0Property1=Value1;Property2=Value2;...Propertyn=Valuen\n  |\n|\n Input Parameters\n  |\n Enter the query in the form Property1=Value1;Property2=Value2;...Propertyn=Valuen.\u00a0You can refer it from Parameters Helper.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the Connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500008509361\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003912\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMicrosoft Reporting Service Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,681\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "microsoft_reporting_service_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "file_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaowGAC"}]}
