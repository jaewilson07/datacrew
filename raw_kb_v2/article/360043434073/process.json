NUVI does not have API documentation available, but you can visit their website at\n\nhttps://www.nuvi.com/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your NUVI account in the Data Center using PostgreSQL\u00a0credentials. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the NUVI connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nDomo's NUVI connector pulls data from a PostgreSQL database. To connect to your NUVI account and create a DataSet, you must have PostgreSQL credentials, as follows:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your PostgreSQL database\n* The host name for the database\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n\nCA certificate text or URL path is required\n *only*\n if you select\n **Certificate text**\n or\n **URL path**\n ,\u00a0respectively, in the\n **Certificate type**\n menu.\n\n\n Before you can connect to a PostgreSQL database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your NUVI Account\n---------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the NUVI Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to NUVI's PostgreSQL database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your PostgreSQL username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your PostgreSQL password.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the SQL database.
