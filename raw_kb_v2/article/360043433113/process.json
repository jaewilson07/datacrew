Domo's\u00a0Apache Kafka REST Proxy Connector lets you pull information on brokers, partitions, topics, topic metadata, and topic records so that you can cut through the noise and focus on the most vital communication. To learn more about the Kafka REST API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         https://docs.confluent.io/current/ka...ocs/intro.html\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your Kafka server and set up an acccount\u00a0in the Data Center.
