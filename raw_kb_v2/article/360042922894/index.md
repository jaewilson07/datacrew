Earn Rewards

Ranks in the Community Forum reflect activity and engagement. The rank structure is similar to the karate belt system. Upon registration, each member is assigned a "white belt" rank.


 As you ask questions, receive reactions to your posts, and reply to other discussions, you accumulate points. The more points you have, the higher rank association you earn.


 As you move up the ranks, you earn rewards. Rewards include a Domopalooza ticket, a VIP spotlight article in the Community Forum, and a physical black belt mailed to you with your name embroidered on it. To learn more about ranks and badges, see the
