 You connect to your FreshBooks account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the FreshBooks connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

.


 Prerequisites

To connect to your FreshBooks account and create a DataSet, you must have your FreshBooks username and password.


 Connecting to Your FreshBooks Account
---------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 ****Credentials****
 and
 ****Details****
 panes in the FreshBooks Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 ****Scheduling****
 and
 ****Name & Describe Your DataSet,****
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo FreshBooks connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 ****Connect****
 (or select
 ****Add Account****
 if you have existing FreshBooks accounts in Domo) to open the FreshBooks OAuth screen where you can enter your FreshBooks credentials. Once you have entered valid FreshBooks credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new FreshBooks DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 ****Accounts****
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

***Note:****
 If you are already logged into FreshBooks when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 ****Add account****
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of FreshBooks.

Yes.

 How often can the data be updated?

As often as needed.
