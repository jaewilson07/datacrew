All you do is decide whether you want your conversation to center around people or a data element (a Card, Page, or Project). If your message centers around people, you just open Buzz and write a message to the person or people you want (or add to the conversation if one already exists). If your message centers around a data element, you locate that element in Domo, and a Buzz conversation window opens for the element automatically. You then decide who you want to see it, then post away.\n\n\n You have many options available when posting. You can attach files;\u00a0reference Cards, users, or Projects; invite new users to a conversation; add emojis; and so on.\n\n\n You can also interact with others' messages in a variety of ways, such as adding them to favorites, \"liking\" them, quoting them in replies; etc.\n\n*Video - Buzz Overview**\n\n\n**Video - Sharing Domo Data with Buzz**\n\nStarting or opening a conversation\n------------------------------------\n\nYou can start a new Buzz conversation or open an existing conversation.\n\n##\n Starting a conversation\n\nYou start a Buzz conversation using\u00a0the\n **Add Conversation**\n option, which is available either by clicking the\n\nicon in the top right corner of Buzz or the\n\nicon next to \"Conversations\" in the navigation pane. This opens a dialog in which you select the users and/or groups you want to converse with. (You can also open existing conversations from this dialog.) Once you find the user or group you want to start a conversation with, you indicate whether you want to begin a new topic of conversation or join an existing one.\u00a0If the topic is new, you are prompted to enter a title for the topic as well as set privacy options. Finally, you can compose your message.\n\n\n**To start a Buzz conversation,**\n\n. (Conditional) If Buzz is not open, open it by clicking\n\nin the toolbar in the top right corner of Domo.\n2. Click\n\n, which appears in the black bar above Buzz in the top right corner.\n\n\n Alternatively, if you are in the navigation pane, you can click\n\nnext to \"Conversations.\"\n\n\n The\n **New Message**\n dialog opens.\n3. In the\n **People, Groups, or Conversations**\n field, enter the name of a person or group you want to start a conversation with.\n\n\n This adds the name of the person or group to the field.\n4. (Optional) Repeat step 3 to add more users and groups to this conversation, if desired.\n5. Turn on the\n **New Topic**\n toggle.\n6. Enter a name for the new topic in the\n **Conversation Topic**\n field.\n7. (Optional) Specify whether this conversation is to be private or public.\n\n\n If it is private, only the users whose names you have added to the filter box will be able to see it. If it is public, anyone in your company will be able to see it.\n8. Enter your initial message for the conversation in the\n **Write a message**\n field at the bottom of the dialog.\n\n\n For more information about writing messages, see\n\nPosting to Buzz\n\n.\n9. Hit Enter when done.\n\nThe conversation is added to Domo and appears in the\n **Conversations**\n tab in your Inbox so you can access it easily. For more information, see\n\nPosting to Buzz\n\n.\n\n\n You can also initiate a conversation with a specified user from their Profile page.\n\n\n**To start a Buzz conversation from a user's Profile page,**\n\n. Click the\n\nicon found under the user's photo in the top left corner of their Profile, then click the\n **Message**\n**[User Name]**\n button under it.\n2. Enter your message in the\n **Write a message**\n field at the bottom of the dialog.\n\n\n For more information about writing messages, see\n\nPosting to Buzz\n\n.\n3. Hit Enter when done.\n\nThe conversation is added to Domo and appears in the\n **Conversations**\n tab in your Inbox so you can access it easily. For more information, see\n\nPosting to Buzz\n\n.\n\n##\n Opening an existing conversation\n\nYou can open an existing People conversation in one of several ways. The most straightforward way is to open it from the\n **Conversations**\n list\u00a0in the Buzz navigation pane\u00a0(or the\n **Favorites**\n list, if you have added it as a Favorite). If the conversation does not appear here, you can find it easily by searching in the\n **Search Buzz**\n dialog. You can also open it from the\n **Discover**\n pane, though it may be harder to find the specific conversation you want. On top of this, you can open a conversation from the\n **Add Conversation**\n\ndialog.\n\n###\n Opening a conversation from the Conversations or Favorites\u00a0List\n\nYou can open an existing conversation from the\n **Conversations**\n or\n **Favorites**\n list\u00a0in the Buzz navigation menu.\n\n\n**To open a conversation from the Conversations or Favorites list,**\n\n. (Conditional) If Buzz is not open, open it by clicking\n\nin the toolbar in the top right corner of Domo.\n2. Locate the desired conversation by doing any combination of the following:\n\n* Navigating through the list of recent conversations in the\n\t **Conversations**\n\t list.\n\t* Navigating through conversations you have favorited in the\n\t **Favorites**\n\t list.\n\t* Searching for the desired conversation by clicking in the\n\t **Search**\n\t field to open the\n\t **Search Buzz**\n\t pane then entering a keyword into the search box. This search returns results for titles, users, and message content.\n3. Click the conversation to open it in the conversation pane.\n\n\n You can now read it, reply to it, etc.\n\n\n####\n Opening a conversation from the New Message\u00a0dialog\n\nYou can open\u00a0a conversation from\u00a0the\n **New Message**\n dialog (the same dialog you use when starting a conversation, as explained above).\n\n\n**To open a conversation from the New Message dialog,**\n\n. (Conditional) If Buzz is not open, open it by clicking\n\nin the toolbar in the top right corner of Domo.\n2. Click\n\n, which appears in the black bar above Buzz in the top right corner.\n\n\n Alternatively, if you are in the navigation pane, you can click\n\nnext to \"Conversations.\"\n\n\n The\n **New Message**\n dialog opens.\n3. In the\n **People, Groups, or Conversations**\n field, enter the name of the user, group, Page, Card, or Project that your desired Buzz conversation is centered around.\n4. (Conditional) If you want to open an existing one-on-one conversation, select the name of the user in the\n **People & Groups**\n list. Otherwise, select the conversation in the\n **Existing Conversations**\n list (which opens below\n **People & Groups**\n ).\n\n\n The conversation opens in the pane on the right.\n5. Enter your message in the\n **Write a message**\n field.\n\n\n For more information about writing messages, see\n\nPosting to Buzz\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Opening a conversation from the Discover Pane\n\nYou can open conversations from the\n **Discover**\n pane; however,\u00a0if you are searching for a specific conversation, it is recommended you use one of the previously discussed methods.\n\n\n**To open a conversation from the Discover pane,**\n\n. (Conditional) If Buzz is not open, open it by clicking\n\nin the toolbar in the top right corner of Domo.\n2. Click\n **Discover**\n .\n3. Scroll through the pane\u00a0until you find the conversation you're looking for.\n4. Click the conversation to open it in the conversation pane.\n\n\n You can now read it, reply to it, etc.\n\n\n####\n Opening a conversation from the Profile page\n\nYou can open an existing one-on-one conversation with a user from his/her Profile page.\n\n\n**To open a Buzz conversation from a user's Profile page,**\n\n. Click the\n\nicon found under the user's photo in the top left corner of their Profile, then click the\n **Message**\n**[User Name]**\n button under it.\n\n\n You can now read the conversation, reply to it, etc.\n\nPosting to Buzz\n-----------------\n\nOnce you have started or opened a conversation, you can post by entering your message in the\n **Write a message**\n field at the bottom of the conversation pane.\n\n\n You can do all of the following when posting to Buzz:\n\n Enter carriage returns using Shift+Enter.\n* Copy and paste text from other sources, including web pages.\n* Reference users, groups, Cards, Pages, and Projects by entering the @ symbol followed by the item you want to reference. Or you can use @all to reference all users and groups with access to the conversation. In a conversation centered on a Card, Page, or Project, if you attempt to reference a user or group without access to that Card, Page, or Project, you are given a warning and the option to grant access, as shown here:\n\nIf you click\n **Grant Access**\n , the user or group members are given access to the Card, Page, or Project. For more information about access sharing, see\n\nSharing Access to Cards and Pages\n\n.\n\n\n When you reference a Card, you can open a preview of the Card with different options. This is discussed later in this list.\n* Enter URLs. These appear as working hyperlinks when posted. You do\n *not*\n need to include \"\n\nhttp://\"\n\n\" in a URL for it to be converted into a hyperlink.\n* Attach files to your message by clicking\u00a0the\n\nbutton, selecting\n **Upload**\n**a file**\n , and browsing to the desired file on your computer.\n\n\n In the interest of preventing users from uploading malicious files into Domo accounts, Domo allows a specific set of file types to be uploaded. If you attempt to upload a file not within this list, an error message appears. For more information, see\n\nPreviewing a Document\n\n. If you click an attached file with an unpreviewable file type, the standard \"What would you like to do with this file?\" dialog opens.\n* Reference Cards in\u00a0your message\u00a0by clicking the\n\nbutton, selecting\n **Add\u00a0a Card**\n , and searching for the Card using the\n **Search**\n box. (You can also reference Cards using @, as described previously.) You can only attach Cards you have access to.\u00a0As with attached\u00a0files, referenced Cards appear as thumbnails under the conversation pane and can be removed by clicking the red \"x.\" If you attempt to reference a Card in a discussion with\u00a0a user without access, you are given the option to grant them access.\n\n\n If you click a referenced Card either before or after sending your message, a preview of the Card opens. The preview provides options for jumping to the\n\nDetails view\n\n, adding the Card to a\n\nFavorites\n\n.\n* Add an emoji to your message by clicking\n\nand selecting the desired emoji.\n* Use special commands using \"/.\" The following table lists some of these:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Command\n  |\n Description\n  |\n|\n\n/invite\u00a0[\n\n\n someone@domain.com\n\n\n ]\n\n|\n Can be used to invite anyone to a Buzz conversation, even if they do not have a Domo account.

For more information, see\n\nSpecifying Authorized Domains for Invited Users\n\n.\n  |\n|\n\n/giphy\u00a0[text]\n\n|\n Lets you insert an\u00a0animated\u00a0GIF\u00a0in a message based on text inserted afterward. For example, if you said\n\n/giphy\u00a0sasquatch,\n\na GIF image of a sasquatch would appear in your Buzz\n\n. You can select from available GIFs\u00a0after entering the\n\n\n giphy\n\ncommand, or you can insert a random GIF by pressing Enter after entering the command.\n  |\n|\n\n/roll\n\n|\n \"Rolls\" a random number between 0 and 100.\n  |\n|\n\n/support\n\n|\n Opens a window to the Help Center options.
