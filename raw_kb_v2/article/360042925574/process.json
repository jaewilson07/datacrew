All you do is decide whether you want your conversation to center around people or a data element (a Card, Page, or Project). If your message centers around people, you just open Buzz and write a message to the person or people you want (or add to the conversation if one already exists). If your message centers around a data element, you locate that element in Domo, and a Buzz conversation window opens for the element automatically. You then decide who you want to see it, then post away.\n                       \n\n                        You have many options available when posting. You can attach files;\u00a0reference Cards, users, or Projects; invite new users to a conversation; add emojis; and so on.\n                       \n\n                        You can also interact with others' messages in a variety of ways, such as adding them to favorites, \"liking\" them, quoting them in replies; etc.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Buzz Overview\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - Sharing Domo Data with Buzz\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Starting or opening a conversation\n                       \n\n                        You can start a new Buzz conversation or open an existing conversation.\n                       \n\n                        Starting a conversation\n                       \n\n                        You start a Buzz conversation using\u00a0the\n                        \n                         Add Conversation\n                        \n                        option, which is available either by clicking the\n                        \n                        icon in the top right corner of Buzz or the\n                        \n                        icon next to \"Conversations\" in the navigation pane. This opens a dialog in which you select the users and/or groups you want to converse with. (You can also open existing conversations from this dialog.) Once you find the user or group you want to start a conversation with, you indicate whether you want to begin a new topic of conversation or join an existing one.\u00a0If the topic is new, you are prompted to enter a title for the topic as well as set privacy options.
