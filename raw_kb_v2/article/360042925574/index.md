Intro
-------

Chatting with coworkers in Buzz is easy. All you do is decide whether you want your conversation to center around people or a data element (a Card, Page, or Project). If your message centers around people, you just open Buzz and write a message to the person or people you want (or add to the conversation if one already exists). If your message centers around a data element, you locate that element in Domo, and a Buzz conversation window opens for the element automatically. You then decide who you want to see it, then post away.


 You have many options available when posting. You can attach files; reference Cards, users, or Projects; invite new users to a conversation; add emojis; and so on.


 You can also interact with others' messages in a variety of ways, such as adding them to favorites, "liking" them, quoting them in replies; etc.

Or you can use @all to reference all users and groups with access to the conversation. In a conversation centered on a Card, Page, or Project, if you attempt to reference a user or group without access to that Card, Page, or Project, you are given a warning and the option to grant access, as shown here:

If you click
 **Grant Access**
 , the user or group members are given access to the Card, Page, or Project. For more information about access sharing, see

button, selecting
 **Upload**

 In the interest of preventing users from uploading malicious files into Domo accounts, Domo allows a specific set of file types to be uploaded. If you attempt to upload a file not within this list, an error message appears. For more information, see

Previewing a Document

. If you click an attached file with an unpreviewable file type, the standard "What would you like to do with this file?" dialog opens.
* Reference Cards in your message by clicking the

button, selecting
 **Add a Card**
 , and searching for the Card using the
 **Search**
 box. (You can also reference Cards using @, as described previously.) You can only attach Cards you have access to. As with attached files, referenced Cards appear as thumbnails under the conversation pane and can be removed by clicking the red "x." If you attempt to reference a Card in a discussion with a user without access, you are given the option to grant them access.


 If you click a referenced Card either before or after sending your message, a preview of the Card opens. The preview provides options for jumping to the
