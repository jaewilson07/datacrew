You can compare these statistics with your own data or analyze this information as external factors.\n\n\n In addition to the API, e-Stat offers data in Excel or PDF format. However, the connector only supports data retrieval through the API.\n\n\n You connect to your e-Stat account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the e-Stat Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your e-Stat account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The Application ID for your e-Stat account\n\nTo find how to register as a user with e-Stat and how to get the application ID, refer to\n\n\u5229\u7528\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to your e-Stat Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the e-Stat Connector page.
