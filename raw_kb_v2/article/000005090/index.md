e-Stat is the one-stop service for official statistics of Japanese government.


 The e-Stat Connector allows you to import various official statistics such as Population Estimates, Labour Force Survey, GDP, etc. into your Domo instance. You can compare these statistics with your own data or analyze this information as external factors.


 In addition to the API, e-Stat offers data in Excel or PDF format. However, the connector only supports data retrieval through the API.
