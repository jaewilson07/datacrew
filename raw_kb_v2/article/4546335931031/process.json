Waffle charts provide a new, simple and intuitive way to visualize data as it includes many customizable settings to tell a more informative story.

The other option is an Optional Max Value that you intend for your data to achieve.\u00a0For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        If multiple rows are present in your DataSet, the values in all of the rows are aggregated. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the target value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for \"Team A\" that both had a target value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new target value of 200.

For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200.\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Waffle Gauge.
