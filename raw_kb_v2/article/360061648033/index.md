 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
