This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Clavis Edge Digital Shelf connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Primary Use Cases**  |\n This Connector lets you retrieve data about the products and brands performance in online stores.\n  |\n| **Primary Metrics**  | * Products\n* Search terms used for the online search\n* Competitor's data\n |\n| **Primary Company Roles**  | * Sales and Marketing teams\n* Analytics\n* Online Markets and Stores\n* Market Researchers\n |\n| **Average Implementation Time**  |\n Less than an hour\n  |\n| **Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**  |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* If your subscription has global access, you may need to enter the instance name. It will be a 2 letter word like au, us etc. The data will be fetched for that instance (country) only.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Clavis\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The access token from your digital shelf UI to authenticate the account.\n* (Optional) The instance if your subscription has global access.

You may want to enter the instance if your subscription has global access. It will be a 2 letter word like au, us etc. The data will be fetched for that instance (country) only.\n\n###\n Can I use the same account to create multiple datasets?\n\nYes\n\n###\n What is the difference between the Clavis and\n\nClavis Edge Digital Shelf c\n\nonnectors?\n\nThe Clavis connector uses version 1 of the Clavis API (\n\nhttps://api.clavistechnology.com/v1/\n\n) whereas the Clavis Edge Digital Shelf connector uses version 2 of the Clavis API (\n\nhttps://insights-api.clavistechnology.com/api/v2/\n\n).\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nThe API requests are restricted to 50,000 requests per hour per single IP address and 20 requests per minute per customer.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360061648033\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003253\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nClavis Edge Digital Shelf Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,379\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "clavis_edge_digital_shelf_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
