It allows you to combine data from multiple platforms in such a way that multiple inputs can be defined as one single metric without the use of SQL or custom programming. Stacker also provides change records to administrators through the Domo activity log,\u00a0ensuring security and optimizing governance possibilities. You can access the activity log from the navigation header by selecting\n                        \n                         More\n                        \n                        >\n                        \n                         Admin\n                        \n                        .\u00a0Under\n                        \n                         Governance\n                        \n                        ,\u00a0select\n                        \n                         Activity log\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Using Enterprise Stacker, you can combine the following two tables that come\u00a0from two different channels into one impressions table.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Using `Views` as the metric we are stacking, here is our output impressions table:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        When to use Enterprise Stacker\n                       \n\n                        Enterprise Stacker works well in the following situations:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Use Case\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Benefits of Stacker\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Data exists in multiple platforms or DataSets\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             Combines\u00a0and standardizes metrics across platforms and visualizations\n                            \n\n                             Supports inconsistent granularities\n                            \n\n                             Doesn't require technical skill sets\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            One Master DataSet is required or preferred\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             Brings data into one DataSet for visualization\n                            \n\n                             Simplifies Domo Page Analyzer\n                            \n\n                             Simplifies PDP policy application\n                            \n\n                             Provides one source of truth\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Data size is more than 50-100M rows\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             Leverages Domo Query Performance\n                            \n\n                             Allow for aggregation or filtering down data\n                            \n\n                             Billions of rows quickly aggregated to millions of rows in minutes\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Other benefits\u00a0include:\n                       \n\n\n                         Output is dynamic based on configured dimensions and metrics\n                        \n\n                         Wildcard inputs \u2014\u00a0thousands of DataSets combined quickly\n                        \n\n                         Thousands of\u00a0input data sources\n                        \n\n                         Hundreds of possible metrics/dimensions\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Tip:\n                             \n                             We recommend fewer than 50 metrics to optimize speed.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        This article describes Enterprise Stacker setup and how to complete various tasks within it in the following topics:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Getting Enterprise Stacker\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Prerequisite\n                         \n\n                          s\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Creating a\u00a0job\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Adding multiple metrics to a job\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Activity logs\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Getting Enterprise Stacker\n                       \n\n                        Contact your Account Executive (AE) or Technical Consultant (TC) to begin the deployment process.\n                       \n\n                        Domo will access your instance to deploy Enterprise Stacker and align it with the provided system user account's email.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        There are a few things to prepare and consider before using Enterprise Stacker:\n                       \n\n\n                         Ensure the cleanliness of the data before stacking.
