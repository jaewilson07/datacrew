To learn more about\u00a0the\u00a0PagerDuty API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://developer.pagerduty.com/documentation/rest\n\n).\n\n\n The PagerDuty connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This is the simplified version of this connector, which allows you to simply pull data for a previous month instead of specifying a date range. There is also an advanced version of the connector, which provides options for setting up a date range. For more information, see\n\nPagerDuty Advanced Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0PagerDuty connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The API key for your\u00a0PagerDuty account. For information about generating a PagerDuty API key, see\n\nhttps://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202829310-Generating-an-API-Key\n\n.\n* The domain for your PagerDuty URL. For example, if your PagerDuty URL was\n `domo.pagerduty.com`\n , you would enter\n `domo`\n as the domain.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0PagerDuty Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the\u00a0API Key\u00a0for your\u00a0PagerDuty account.\n  |\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the domain for your PagerDuty URL.\n  |\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0PagerDuty credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0PagerDuty DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary\u00a0menu from which you can select a report, along with various other fields and menus that may or may not appear depending on your selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0PagerDuty report.

For example, if you enter\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Date Offset**\n and set the\u00a0DataSet to update\u00a0daily, each\u00a0new day the report will update to show information for the date 5 days in the past.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Date Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of days back from the current date that will be presented in the report.\n  |\n|\n Date Granularity\n  |\n Select whether you want report data to be shown by day, week, or month.\n  |\n|\n Policy Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the policy you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Policy ID\n  |\n Enter ID of the policy you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Incident ID\n  |\n Enter the ID of the incident you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n User ID(s)\n  |\n Enter the ID(s) of the user(s) you want to retrieve information for.
