This removes Beast Modes from Cards or DataSets. You are only able to archive a Beast Mode if it is not in use on a Card. The archive feature is also available for bulk use. You can select up to 100 Beast Modes at a time when using bulk\u00a0archive. There is no limit to the total amount of Beast Modes that you can archive.\n                       \n\n                        You can then unarchive\u00a0Beast Modes and it will restore it to the Card or DataSet it originated from. If a Card or DataSet is deleted, then the Beast Mode is also deleted.

This allows you to rename the Beast Mode or delete duplicate Beast Modes.

Instead of executing the visualization query against Domo, the query is executed at the target database and the results are sent to Domo to render the visualization. This model is especially relevant for users who would like to keep their data at rest in their infrastructure for security or logistical reasons.
