 New features and enhancements
--------------------------------

Features and enhancements in this release include the following:


 Beast Mode Manager
--------------------

Improvements to Beast Mode Manager make managing your Beast Modes even easier.

##
 Archive Beast Modes

You now have the ability to archive Beast Modes. This removes Beast Modes from Cards or DataSets. You are only able to archive a Beast Mode if it is not in use on a Card. The archive feature is also available for bulk use. You can select up to 100 Beast Modes at a time when using bulk archive. There is no limit to the total amount of Beast Modes that you can archive.


 You can then unarchive Beast Modes and it will restore it to the Card or DataSet it originated from. If a Card or DataSet is deleted, then the Beast Mode is also deleted. For more information, see

Beast Mode Manager

.


###
 Duplicate Beast Mode name modal

Inside of Analyzer, there is a new modal that appears when there is a duplicate Beast Mode name. This allows you to rename the Beast Mode or delete duplicate Beast Modes. For more information, see

Enhanced Connector scheduling
-------------------------------

The new Connector scheduler showcases a simplified and streamlined UI that is easier to understand and displays your time zone when scheduling. Connectors are still scheduled in UTC, but our new Scheduler shows you what time that converts to in your chosen time zone. For more information, see

 Federated Data
----------------

Domo's Federated Data model allows you to directly render Cards and other user-level interactions in the Domo platform using a database hosted outside of Domo's cloud. Instead of executing the visualization query against Domo, the query is executed at the target database and the results are sent to Domo to render the visualization. This model is especially relevant for users who would like to keep their data at rest in their infrastructure for security or logistical reasons. For more information, see
