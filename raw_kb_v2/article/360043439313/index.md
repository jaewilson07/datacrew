Intro
-------

DomoStats gives you the freedom to explore how your team is using Domo. Because DomoStats is powered by a live Domo DataSet with no configuration, you can easily build cards, alerts, and workflows around the metrics you want to see as well as use the pre-built dashboard.


 This DomoStats app provides key insights into your organization's Domo Projects and Tasks. Ensure projects will be delivered on time by monitoring all your open projects and tasks in a single dashboard. Identify at-risk projects, address overdue tasks, and manage team workloads by tracking assignee productivity and efficiency.
