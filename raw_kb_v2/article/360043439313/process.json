Ensure projects will be delivered on time by monitoring all your open projects and tasks in a single dashboard. Identify at-risk projects, address overdue tasks, and manage team workloads by tracking assignee productivity and efficiency.\n                       \n\n                        Video - Domostats - Projects and Tasks App\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Requirements\n                       \n\n                        You must have Admin level access to download from the Appstore.\n                       \n\n                        Using the DomoStats App\n                       \n\n                        You can use the pre-built dashboard or build any of your own content using the DomoStats DataSets in the Data Center.
