When you assign a task to a user, that user receives a notification of the assignment in the\u00a0Buzz feed for this project, as well as via email/SMS.\n\n\n There are several ways to do this, including the following:\n\n Entering a task directly in the box at the bottom of the desired task list in the project details page.\n* Clicking the\n **Assign Task**\n button in the project details page and filling out the details of the task in the dialog.\n* Clicking a user's profile picture, clicking\n **Assign Task**\n , and specifying the task details in the dialog.\n* Entering a task in Buzz, selecting\n **Create Task**\n from the ...\u00a0menu, when you hover over a message, and specifying the task details in the dialog.\n\n\n**Notes**\n :\n\n\n\t+ You can\n\t *only*\n\t assign tasks in projects of which you are a team member (unless you have an \"Admin\"\n\n custom role\n\n with \"Manage All Projects and Tasks\" enabled). A user does\n\t *not*\n\t already need to be a team member for the current project to receive a task assignment in that project.\n\t+ You can assign a task to anyone in your company with a Domo account. If you do assign a task to a non-team member, they are added as a new team member for this project.\n\t+ You can assign tasks to others while in your \"Personal Tasks\" project. If you do not choose a different project, these tasks do not remain in your \"Personal Tasks,\" but are sent to the \"To Do\" list in the assignee's \"Personal Tasks\" project.\n\n\n**Video\u00a0- Creating and Managing Tasks**\n\n\n**Video\u00a0- Viewing and Organizing Tasks**\n\nEntering a Task Directly into a Task List\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you create a task by entering it directly into the\n **Add a task**\n box in the project task list, you are automatically assigned as the task owner.\n\n*To enter a task into a list,**\n\n.

Type the task into the\n **Add a task**\n box in the desired list.\n4. Press Enter.\n\nThe task appears in the workflow where you entered it.\n\n\n When you create a task in this way, you are automatically assigned as the task owner and the first contributor. The\n *owner*\n of a task is intended to be the person accountable for the task completion and can be the point person for decision-making and clarification.\n *Contributors*\n are any people besides the owner who are involved with the task and\u00a0need visibility.\n\n\n If you want, you can change the owner and contributors of a task in the task edit dialog. You change the owner by clicking the\n **Change**\n link in the\n **Owner**\n field and selecting a new owner. You change and add new contributors in the\n **Contributors**\n field.\n\n\n**Note:**\n You can only enter the name of a user you want to add in the Activity Area of Projects and Tasks. Groups can not be added to the Activity Area. For more information about Buzz, see\n\nChatting in Buzz\n\n.\n\n*To change the owner and/or contributors\u00a0assigned to a workflow task,**\n\n.
