Intro
-------

You can create and assign tasks in any project for which you have access. When you assign a task to a user, that user receives a notification of the assignment in the Buzz feed for this project, as well as via email/SMS.


 There are several ways to do this, including the following:

 Entering a task directly in the box at the bottom of the desired task list in the project details page.
* Clicking the
 **Assign Task**
 button in the project details page and filling out the details of the task in the dialog.
* Clicking a user's profile picture, clicking
 **Assign Task**
 , and specifying the task details in the dialog.
* Entering a task in Buzz, selecting
 **Create Task**
 from the ... menu, when you hover over a message, and specifying the task details in the dialog.


**Notes**
 :


	+ You can
	 *only*
	 assign tasks in projects of which you are a team member (unless you have an "Admin"

 custom role

 with "Manage All Projects and Tasks" enabled). A user does
	 *not*
	 already need to be a team member for the current project to receive a task assignment in that project.
	+ You can assign a task to anyone in your company with a Domo account. If you do assign a task to a non-team member, they are added as a new team member for this project.
	+ You can assign tasks to others while in your "Personal Tasks" project. If you do not choose a different project, these tasks do not remain in your "Personal Tasks," but are sent to the "To Do" list in the assignee's "Personal Tasks" project.

Entering a Task Directly into a Task List
-------------------------------------------

 box in the project task list, you are automatically assigned as the task owner.

 box in the desired list.
4. Press Enter.

The task appears in the workflow where you entered it.


 When you create a task in this way, you are automatically assigned as the task owner and the first contributor. The
 *owner*
 of a task is intended to be the person accountable for the task completion and can be the point person for decision-making and clarification.
 *Contributors*
 are any people besides the owner who are involved with the task and need visibility.


 If you want, you can change the owner and contributors of a task in the task edit dialog. You change the owner by clicking the

	 **Contributors**
	 field.
