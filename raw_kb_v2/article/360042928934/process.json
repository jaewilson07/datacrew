You can use Domo's Oracle ADWC connector to pull data from your Oracle data warehouse and compile custom reports. To learn more about the Oracle ADWC, visit their website (\n\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en\\_US/datawarehouse\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Oracle ADWC account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Oracle ADWC connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Oracle ADWC account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The name of the service you want to connect to.\u00a0Your service names are found in the\n\ntnsnames.ora\n\nfile inside your connection wallet. Each service name is the text on the left of the\n\n'='\n\nin each entry in\n\ntnsnames.ora\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The entries may contain a field named\n **service\\_name**\n .\u00a0This is\n *not*\n the Oracle service that needs to be provided.\n\nFor example,\u00a0the Oracle service of the following entry is\n\nadw\\_high\n\n.\n\n\n`adw_high = (description= (address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1522)(host=\n\nadb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com\n\n))(connect_data=(service_name=qfd8c2d8u4sdf_adw_high.\n\nadwc.oraclecloud.com\n\n)))`\n* Your Oracle database username and password\n* A Base64-encoded wallet file. You can download this file from the Oracle ADWC\u00a0console. To encode the wallet file, use the command line\u00a0to navigate to the directory of your zipped wallet file. Run the command corresponding to your operating system, replacing\n\nwallet.zip\n\nwith the name of your wallet file:\n\n\n Windows:\n\ncertutil -encode wallet.zip encoded\\_wallet.txt\n\nMac/Linux:\n\nbase64 -i wallet.zip -o encoded\\_wallet.txt\n\nThis will generate a text file named\n\nencoded\\_wallet.txt\n\n. Open this file\u00a0and copy ALL of the text. Paste the text into the\n **Base64 Encoded Wallet**\n field.\n\n\n###\n Whitelisting\n\nBefore you can connect to an Oracle database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Oracle ADWC Database\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Oracle ADWC Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Oracle ADWC database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Oracle Service\n  |\n Enter the name of the Oracle service you want to connect to. For more information about locating your service, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Database Username\n  |\n Enter your Oracle database username.\n  |\n|\n Database Password\n  |\n Enter your Oracle database password.\n  |\n|\n Base64 Encoded Wallet\n  |\n Enter the copied text from the\n\nencoded\\_wallet.txt\n\nfile. For more information about generating this file, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Oracle ADWC DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you input the SQL query you want to use to pull data from your Oracle database. Optionally, you can also indicate the specific table and columns from that table to bring into Domo.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to use to retrieve your data. You can use the\n **Query Helper**\n parameter to help you write a usable SQL query. To use the\n **Query Helper**\n , do the following:\n 1. Select your database table\u00a0and table columns in the appropriate menus.\n2. Copy the SQL statement that appears in the\n **Query Helper**\n field.\n3. Paste the copied SQL statement into the\n **Query**\n field.\n |\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n Select the database tables you want to pull into Domo, if desired.\n  |\n|\n Table Columns\n  |\n Select the table columns you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper\n  |\n (Optional) Copy and paste the SQL statement in this field into the\n **Query**\n field. For more information, see\n **Query**\n , above.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n####\n How do I find and upload the wallet file?\n\nSee \"Prerequisites\" near the top of this page.\n\n###\n How do I find services to connect to?\n\nSee \"Prerequisites\" near the top of this page.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042928934\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003563\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nOracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,697\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "oracle_autonomous_data_warehouse_cloud_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
