Intro

 Basecamp is a web-based project management tool. The Basecamp connector integrates Domo with Basecamp to extract data from the Basecamp API. You can use this connector to retrieve data about documents, attachments, calendar events, projects, people, and the like. To learn more about the Basecamp API, visit their Github page (


 https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api


 ).

The Basecamp connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

You connect to your Basecamp account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Basecamp connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

 Prerequisites
----------------


 To connect to your Basecamp account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:


* The username or email address you use to log into Basecamp
* The password you use to log into Basecamp


 Connecting to Your Basecamp Account
--------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Basecamp Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


###

Credentials Pane


 The Domo Basecamp connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Basecamp accounts in Domo) to open the Basecamp OAuth screen where you can enter your Basecamp username/email address and password. Once you have entered valid Basecamp credentials and authorized Domo to connect to Basecamp, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Basecamp DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.


**Note:**
 If you are already logged into Basecamp when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Basecamp.


###

Details Pane


 This pane contains two primary menus,
 **Account ID**
 and
 **Reports**
 , along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.

 FAQ
-----


#####
 How do I know my Basecamp 3 account credentials are secure?

The login process uses the OAuth process so your Basecamp credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure.

####
 How frequently will my data update?

As often as needed.

####
 Can this connector pull custom fields?

No. Reports and columns are predefined by Basecamp.

####
 What is the difference between the Basecamp and the Basecamp 3 connector?

The Basecamp 3 connector provides more reports and also has more options available to retrieve filtered, customized, and meaningful data.
