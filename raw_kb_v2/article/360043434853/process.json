The\u00a0Basecamp connector integrates Domo with\u00a0Basecamp to extract data from the Basecamp API. You can use this connector to retrieve data about documents, attachments, calendar events, projects, people, and the like. To learn more about the\u00a0Basecamp API, visit their Github page (\n\n\n https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api\n\n\n ).\n\nThe Basecamp connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your Basecamp account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Basecamp connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for retrieving project status and task and project completion rates.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Project managers\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 10 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Basecamp account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The username or email address you use to log into Basecamp\n* The password you use to log into Basecamp\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Basecamp Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Basecamp Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n The Domo\u00a0Basecamp connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Basecamp accounts in Domo)\u00a0to open the\u00a0Basecamp OAuth screen where you can enter your Basecamp username/email address\u00a0and password. Once you have entered valid\u00a0Basecamp credentials and authorized Domo to connect to Basecamp, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Basecamp DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n If you are already logged into Basecamp when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Basecamp.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains\u00a0two primary menus,\n **Account ID**\n and\n **Reports**\n , along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nAccount ID\n\n|\n\nSelect the Basecamp account ID you want to retrieve information for.\n\n|\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect a Basecamp report.

This keeps your login secure.\n\n####\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Can this connector pull custom fields?\n\nNo. Reports and columns are predefined by Basecamp.\n\n####\n What is the difference between the Basecamp and the Basecamp\u00a03 connector?\n\nThe Basecamp 3 connector provides more reports and also has more options available to retrieve filtered, customized, and meaningful data.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434853\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003435\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBasecamp Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,635\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "basecamp_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
