The\u00a0Basecamp connector integrates Domo with\u00a0Basecamp to extract data from the Basecamp API. You can use this connector to retrieve data about documents, attachments, calendar events, projects, people, and the like. To learn more about the\u00a0Basecamp API, visit their Github page (\n                        \n\n                         https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api\n                        \n\n                         ).\n                        \n\n\n                        The Basecamp connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n                        \n                         Cloud App\n                        \n                        in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n                       \n\n\n                         You connect to your Basecamp account in the Data Center.
