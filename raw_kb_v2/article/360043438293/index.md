Intro
-------

As an organization, it is always important to keep an eye on the macroeconomics of the country as you plan for and potentially adjust business strategies. The Labor Statics Dashboard pulls information directly from the Bureau of Labor Statists to give you summary views on employment growth, CPI change, college enrollment, employment projections and much more.
