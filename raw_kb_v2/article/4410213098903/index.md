Analytic Functions
--------------------


|
 Function Name
  |
 Description
  |
 Structure
  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|
`FIRST_VALUE`
 |
 Returns the first value in the partition for a given expression. If a window order by clause is not specified the value returned is not guaranteed to be consistent.
  |
`FIRST_VALUE(ANY) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> ANY`
 |
|
`LAG`
 |
 Returns the value of an expression in previous rows based on the offset provided (default 1). Optionally the user can supply a default value if the offset falls out of the range of the partition.
  |
`LAG(ANY[, LONG[, ANY]]) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> ANY`
 |
|
`LEAD`
 |
 Returns the value of an expression in subsequent rows based on the offset provided (default 1). Optionally the user can supply a default value if the offset falls out of the range of the partition.
  |
`LEAD(ANY[, LONG[, ANY]]) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> ANY`
 |
|
`LAST_VALUE`
 |
 Returns the last value in the partition for a given expression. If a window order by clause is not specified the value returned is not guaranteed to be consistent.
  |
`LAST_VALUE(ANY) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> ANY`
 |
|
`MAX`
 |
 Returns the maximum value of an expression within a partition. An order by clause can be supplied and if so the max will be calculated only with values previous to the current row based on the ordering.
  |
`MAX(ANY) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]])`
 |
|
`MIN`
 |
 Returns the minimum value of an expression within a partition. An order by clause can be supplied and if so the min will be calculated only with values previous to the current row based on the ordering.
  |
`MIN(ANY) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]])`
 |
|
`NTILE`
 |
 Equally divides an ordered data set (partition) into a {value} number of subsets within a window, where the subsets are numbered 1 through the value in parameter constant‑value. For example, if constant‑value= 4 and the partition contains 20 rows, NTILE divides the partition rows into four equal subsets of five rows. NTILE assigns each row to a subset by giving row a number from 1 to 4. The rows in the first subset are assigned 1, the next five are assigned 2, and so on.


 If the number of partition rows is not evenly divisible by the number of subsets, the rows are distributed so no subset is more than one row larger than any other subset, and the lowest subsets have extra rows. For example, if constant‑value= 4 and the number of rows = 21, the first subset has six rows, the second subset has five rows, and so on.


 If the number of subsets is greater than the number of rows, then a number of subsets equal to the number of rows is filled, and the remaining subsets are empty.
  |
`NTILE(LONG value) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> LONG`

`PERCENTILE`
 |

|
`PERCENTILE_CONT`
 |
 Returns the value that would fall into the specified percentile among a set of values in each partition.
  |
`NTILE(DOUBLE percentile) WITHIN GROUP ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> ANY`
 |
|
`RANK`
 |
 Ranks each row from 1 to partition row count based on the order clause in the over expression.
  |
`RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> LONG`
 |
|
`STDDEV`

`STDDEV(NUMERIC) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> DOUBLE`
 |
|

  |
`STDDEV_POP(NUMERIC) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> DOUBLE`

  |
`SUM(NUMERIC) OVER ([PARTITION BY ANY] [ORDER BY ANY [ASC|DESC]]) -> NUMERIC`
 |
|
`VAR_POP`
 |
 Similar to
