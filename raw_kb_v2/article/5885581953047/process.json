Story Studio is a Snapchat self-serve tool to create, upload, and publish Shows and publisher stories in Snapchat Discover. Snapchat Publisher API allows a Story Studio user to call the Content, Analytics and Revenue API for their Shows and Publisher Stories.\n\n\n Get the real time updates about your story performance and revenue metrics with Domo's leading business intelligence platform. By combining your data with Domo, you'll be able to develop comprehensive marketing strategies to fully optimize your advertising across all platforms.\n\nTo learn more about the Snapchat Ads API, visit their page (\n\n\n https://developers.snapchat.com/ads/\n\n\n ).\n\nThe Snapchat Publisher Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Snapchat account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Snapchat Publisher Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Snapchat account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password associated with your Snapchat account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Snapchat Publisher Account\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the Snapchat Publisher Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Snapchat Publisher\u00a0Connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if you have existing Snapchat accounts in Domo) to open the Snapchat OAuth screen where you can enter your Snapchat username and password. Once you have entered valid Snapchat credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Snapchat Publisher\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Snapchat when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Snapchat account.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Snapchat Publisher\u00a0report you want to run.

This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 5885581953047\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003186\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSnapchat Publisher Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,759\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "snapchat_publisher_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
