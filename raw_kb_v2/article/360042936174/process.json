Using\u00a0Entitlement Policies, you can\u00a0filter data in a DataSet for specified users and/or groups. PDP policies are applied almost anywhere in Domo\u00a0that data from this DataSet\u00a0is used, including the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Cards. If a card is powered by a DataSet\u00a0with PDP policies applied, affected users and groups see only data in the card that applies to them.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Alerts. An alert's PDP policies filter the alert data and control which users can subscribe.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          DataFusions. When you add input DataSets\u00a0with PDP policies applied to a DataFusion, only the data allowed by the policy is incorporated into the DataFusion.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You cannot add input DataSets\u00a0to a DataFlow\u00a0if you are restricted by PDP policies; however, you can add policies to the output DataSets\u00a0generated by the DataFlow. When executing a DataFlow\u00a0with PDP policies applied, you\n                        \n                         must\n                        \n                        have an \"Admin\" security role or be the DataFlow owner; otherwise the DataFlow will break.\n                       \n\n                        If no Entitlement Policies have been created for a DataSet, anyone the\u00a0DataSet has been shared with will have full access to the data. If a policy is created, only those users in the policy can see data.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          PDP Tab in Data Center\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          PDP\u00a0Policy Selection in Alert Dialog\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Design\u00a0Studio updates\n                       \n\n                        The following enhancements have been made to the Design Studio:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Notifications for users with older versions. Creative Cloud syncs version updates to users, so if users have turned off the Creative Cloud desktop sync application or if they need IT permission to upgrade, their version of Design Studio may be out of date. To accommodate this problem, a notification system has been built to identify users with older versions and instruct them on how to upgrade.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          New font selection interface. The former interface required users to type the font name into a text field. This has now been changed to a drop-down menu that populates with supported web fonts.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Cool new widgets, including...\n                         \n\n\n\n                            A Canadian FSA Map widget that shows data by province and FSA areas.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Image and text link widgets that allow you to link to URLs on Domo's whitelist.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Table Widget V2.
