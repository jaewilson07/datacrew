DataSets for each connector type are represented as stacks on a rotating palette.\u00a0You can configure the order and height of the connector stacks to indicate different metrics. For example, you could sort the connector stacks by number of rows but have the height of the individual stacks represent the number of DataSets.\n                       \n\n                        You\u00a0open The Data Warehouse by selecting\n                        \n                         Data\n                        \n                        in the toolbar at the top of Domo. The\n                        \n                         Data Warehouse\n                        \n                        tab is open by default. If you switch to another tab, you can return to the\n                        \n                         Data Warehouse\n                        \n                        tab by clicking\n                        \n                        in the left-hand navigation pane.\n                       \n\n                        For more information about connecting to data in Domo, see\n                        \n                         Data Center Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Introducing The Data Warehouse\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Manipulating the palette\n                       \n\n                        Mousing over a stack causes the palette to\u00a0stop rotating.\u00a0You can click and drag the panel to\u00a0move it manually. The panel can be\u00a0moved in three dimensions.\u00a0Dragging it left or right rotates it, but you can also drag it up or down. If you drag it all the way up, the view changes as if you were seeing it from the front. If you drag it all the way down, the view changes as if you were seeing it from above.\n                       \n\n                        When\u00a0you mouse over a stack, an information panel appears for the connector. This panel contains the following information:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Number of DataSets\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Total number of rows of data in DataSets for the connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Number of cards built using the connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Understanding the stack and line colors\n                       \n\n                        Stacks are colored differently depending on their type and current activity. Colors\u00a0are as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Green\u00a0indicates a standard, fully functional\u00a0data source\u00a0connector such as MySQL or Adobe Analytics. These stacks appear closer to the edge of the palette.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Blue indicates a Magic ETL DataFlow connector, i.e. a connector built up of multiple data sources. These stacks appear closer to the center of the palette.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Orange\u00a0indicates a warning state for one or more DataSets or DataFlows for a given connector.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Red indicates that one or more DataSets or DataFlows for a given connector is broken and needs immediate attention.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Stacks may be accompanied by green or blue lines. These colors indicate the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Green lines run from outside of the palette to\u00a0data source connector stacks, indicating that\u00a0data is currently being funneled to these connectors.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Blue\u00a0lines\u00a0connect Magic stacks with the data source connector stacks used to power them. These lines appear only when you mouse over Magic stacks.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Understanding\u00a0stack sorting and height\n                       \n\n                        The arrangement of stacks around the palette and the height of the individual stacks\u00a0indicate\u00a0specified metrics. By default, stack arrangement indicates connector status and stack height indicates the number of rows of data found in all\u00a0DataSets for the connector or all DataFlows.\u00a0This is the case in the following\u00a0example:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Sorting on the palette begins to the right of the long gray line and continues counter-clockwise around the palette, ending to the left of the gray line. So, in this example, connector stacks are sorted from the right side to the left side of the line by the\u00a0connector status of the\u00a0DataSets/DataFlows, with the broken (red) stacks appearing first, the orange (warning) stacks next, and so on.\u00a0The height of the individual stacks\u00a0represents the number of rows in the DataSets/DataFlows. However, you can change the criteria determined by the sorting and height. Sort position for a connector\u00a0stack can represent any of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Connector status (default)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Connector name (alphabetically)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Number of cards built using the connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The number of DataSets for this connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Number of rows of data\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Height of a connector\u00a0stack can represent any of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The number of cards\u00a0built using\u00a0the connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Number of rows of data (default)\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The number of DataSets for this connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The number of issues for the connector\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can change\u00a0the sort and height configuration\u00a0in the\n                        \n                         Sort by\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         Height by\n                        \n                        filter menus, respectively.\n                       \n\n                        Searching in the Data Warehouse\n                       \n\n                        You can search for a specific connector\u00a0or DataSet using the Search bar. When you click in the bar, you can access scrollable lists of all data sources, Magic connectors, and DataSets. If you select an item in the Search view, information specific to that item appears on the screen.\n                       \n\n                        Understanding the\u00a0Data Source\u00a0view\n                       \n\n                        When you click a connector stack, the view changes to show\u00a0three-dimensional rectangular representations for all of the\u00a0data sources\u00a0for the connector. As with the connector-level view, you can move the panel to change the view, change the options in the\n                        \n                         Sort by\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         Height by\n                        \n                        menus, and perform a search.
