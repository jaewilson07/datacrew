DataSets for each connector type are represented as stacks on a rotating palette.\u00a0You can configure the order and height of the connector stacks to indicate different metrics. For example, you could sort the connector stacks by number of rows but have the height of the individual stacks represent the number of DataSets.\n\n\n You\u00a0open The Data Warehouse by selecting\n **Data**\n in the toolbar at the top of Domo. The\n **Data Warehouse**\n tab is open by default. If you switch to another tab, you can return to the\n **Data Warehouse**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the left-hand navigation pane.\n\n\n For more information about connecting to data in Domo, see\n\nData Center Layout\n\n.\n\n*Video - Introducing The Data Warehouse**\n\nManipulating the palette\n--------------------------\n\nMousing over a stack causes the palette to\u00a0stop rotating.\u00a0You can click and drag the panel to\u00a0move it manually. The panel can be\u00a0moved in three dimensions.\u00a0Dragging it left or right rotates it, but you can also drag it up or down. If you drag it all the way up, the view changes as if you were seeing it from the front. If you drag it all the way down, the view changes as if you were seeing it from above.\n\n\n When\u00a0you mouse over a stack, an information panel appears for the connector. This panel contains the following information:\n\n Number of DataSets\n* Total number of rows of data in DataSets for the connector\n* Number of cards built using the connector\n\nUnderstanding the stack and line colors\n-----------------------------------------\n\nStacks are colored differently depending on their type and current activity. Colors\u00a0are as follows:\n\n Green\u00a0indicates a standard, fully functional\u00a0data source\u00a0connector such as MySQL or Adobe Analytics. These stacks appear closer to the edge of the palette.\n* Blue indicates a Magic ETL DataFlow connector, i.e. a connector built up of multiple data sources. These stacks appear closer to the center of the palette.\n* Orange\u00a0indicates a warning state for one or more DataSets or DataFlows for a given connector.\n* Red indicates that one or more DataSets or DataFlows for a given connector is broken and needs immediate attention.\n\nStacks may be accompanied by green or blue lines. These colors indicate the following:\n\n Green lines run from outside of the palette to\u00a0data source connector stacks, indicating that\u00a0data is currently being funneled to these connectors.\n* Blue\u00a0lines\u00a0connect Magic stacks with the data source connector stacks used to power them. These lines appear only when you mouse over Magic stacks.\n\nUnderstanding\u00a0stack sorting and height\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe arrangement of stacks around the palette and the height of the individual stacks\u00a0indicate\u00a0specified metrics. By default, stack arrangement indicates connector status and stack height indicates the number of rows of data found in all\u00a0DataSets for the connector or all DataFlows.\u00a0This is the case in the following\u00a0example:\n\nSorting on the palette begins to the right of the long gray line and continues counter-clockwise around the palette, ending to the left of the gray line. So, in this example, connector stacks are sorted from the right side to the left side of the line by the\u00a0connector status of the\u00a0DataSets/DataFlows, with the broken (red) stacks appearing first, the orange (warning) stacks next, and so on.\u00a0The height of the individual stacks\u00a0represents the number of rows in the DataSets/DataFlows. However, you can change the criteria determined by the sorting and height. Sort position for a connector\u00a0stack can represent any of the following:\n\n Connector status (default)\n* Connector name (alphabetically)\n* Number of cards built using the connector\n* The number of DataSets for this connector\n* Number of rows of data\n\nHeight of a connector\u00a0stack can represent any of the following:\n\n The number of cards\u00a0built using\u00a0the connector\n* Number of rows of data (default)\n* The number of DataSets for this connector\n* The number of issues for the connector\n\nYou can change\u00a0the sort and height configuration\u00a0in the\n **Sort by**\n and\n **Height by**\n filter menus, respectively.\n\n\n Searching in the Data Warehouse\n---------------------------------\n\nYou can search for a specific connector\u00a0or DataSet using the Search bar. When you click in the bar, you can access scrollable lists of all data sources, Magic connectors, and DataSets. If you select an item in the Search view, information specific to that item appears on the screen.\n\n\n Understanding the\u00a0Data Source\u00a0view\n------------------------------------\n\nWhen you click a connector stack, the view changes to show\u00a0three-dimensional rectangular representations for all of the\u00a0data sources\u00a0for the connector. As with the connector-level view, you can move the panel to change the view, change the options in the\n **Sort by**\n and\n **Height by**\n menus, and perform a search. A panel at the bottom of the screen shows the data sources, number of DataSets, and number of rows for the connector.\n\n\n If you click a rectangle for a DataSet, the Details view for the DataSet appears.\n\n\n Troubleshooting WebGL issues\n------------------------------\n\nWebGL is a technology used for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics online. It is\u00a0supported by all modern browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc. If you do not have WebGL enabled in your browser, an error message may appear when you try to open The Data Warehouse view.\n\n\n There are a number of things that can cause this error:\n\n\n 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your browser needs to be updated.\n\n\n 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WebGL and hardware acceleration were disabled in your browser. If this is the case,\u00a0try to enable\u00a0it for your particular browser.\n\n\n 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A browser plug-in has disabled your WebGL.\n\n\n 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your computer\u2019s hardware does not support WebGL.\n\n\n 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your computer is in a low-power mode or battery mode and WebGL has been disabled.\n\n\n 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You are running inside a VM, and hardware acceleration has been disabled.\n\n\n Click the following link to view a list\u00a0of browsers that support WebGL. If you don\u2019t see your browser listed, please update your browser to one on this list.\n\nhttps://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl\n\nIf you still can't get WebGL to work, check to see if your hardware is WebGL compatible.\n\n\n WebGL uses the graphics card in your computer so it will not interfere with your main CPU to slow down your computer. If your computer does not have a capable graphics card, you will not be able to view anything in WebGL. In this case,\u00a0you will need to upgrade your graphics card.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043430413\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004908\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nUsing the Data Warehouse to Manage Data\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,155\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:35 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "using_the_data_warehouse_to_manage_data", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "working_with_datasets_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan2GAC"}, {"text": "data_center_overview", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanRGAS"}]}
