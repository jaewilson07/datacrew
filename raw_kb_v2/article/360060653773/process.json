This raw click-stream data forms the dataset used by Adobe Analytics. Use the Adobe Analytics Data Feed connector to import this data from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket where it is stored. To learn more about the Adobe Analytics API, visit their\n\nAPI documentation\n\n.\n\n\n You import Adobe Analytics data feed data by connecting to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket containing the data. You do this in the Data Center in Domo. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Adobe Analytics\u00a0Data feed connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\nTo connect to an AWS S3 bucket\u00a0and import Adobe Analytics data feed data, you must have the following:\n\n Your AWS access key. You can find this in the\n **Security Credentials**\n section of the AWS Console. Alternatively, if you are using IAM, you can find it under\n **Users**\n .\n* Your AWS secret key, which was provided when you created your access key. You can generate a new secret key in the AWS Console.\n* The name of the AWS S3 Bucket you want to retrieve files from.\n* The the S3 Bucket Region where your file is located.\n\n\n Connecting to an AWS\u00a0S3 Bucket and Pulling Adobe Analytics Data\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Adobe Analytics\u00a0Data feed\u00a0V2 Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Adobe Analytics account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Access Key\n  |\n Enter your AWS access key. For information about finding your access key, see\n\n\n Prerequisites\u00a0above.\n  |\n|\n Secret Key\n  |\n Enter your AWS secret key. For information about finding your secret key, see\n\n\n Prerequisites\u00a0above.\n  |\n|\n Bucket\n  |\n Enter the Amazon S3 bucket you want to pull Adobe Analytics data from.\n  |\n|\n Region\n  |\n Select the S3 bucket region where your file is located.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid AWS credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Adobe Analytics Data Feed DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n\nDetails Pane\n\nThis pane contains the options that you can provide or select for retrieving your data from your S3 bucket.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Prefix (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the prefix. Prefix limits results to only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. If none of the file matches, then the connector will search the file in the entire bucket with the entered prefix.\n  |\n|\n Quote Character\n  |\n Select the quote character. Quote character specifies the quotation mark used in data. Example: Single Quote, Double Quote, or None.\n  |\n|\n Additional Columns\n  |\n Select True, if you want the browser details, event list, unique id, and unique visitor id to be displayed in report.\n  |\n|\n Process\u00a0Multiple Files\n  |\n Select True, if you want multiple files to be processed at the time of the first run.\n  |\n\n\n###\n\nOther Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360060653773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003249\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAdobe Analytics Data Feed V2 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,679\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "adobe_analytics_data_feed_v2_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
