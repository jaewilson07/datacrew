Use Domo's WordPress\u00a0connector to retrieve data on blog posts, comments,\u00a0likes, followers, and more. To learn more about the WordPress\u00a0API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\n\n).\n\n\n**Note:**\n This connector is used to retrieve data from\n\nWordPress.com\n\n,\n *not*\n\nWordPress.org\n\n. The essential difference between these is that with\n\nWordPress.org\n\n, you host your own site, whereas with\n\nWordpress.com\n\n, the hosting is done for you. For a more in-depth explanation of these differences, visit\n\nhttps://ithemes.com/tutorials/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your WordPress\u00a0account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the WordPress\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n To connect to your WordPress account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password you use to log into WordPress. Alternatively, you can login using your Google or Apple credentials.\n\nConnecting to Your WordPress Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the WordPress Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo WordPress connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing WordPress accounts in Domo) to open the WordPress OAuth screen where you can enter your WordPress credentials. Once you have entered valid WordPress credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new WordPress DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into WordPress\u00a0when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of WordPress.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n\n*Metrics**\n\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the metric\u00a0type you select.\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the WordPress\n\nmetric\n\nyou want to run.
