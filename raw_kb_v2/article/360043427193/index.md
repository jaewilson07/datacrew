System Requirements for iOS Version
-------------------------------------

For security purposes, Domo supports devices running on the latest iOS (iOS 14). We then typically support the current version of iOS minus 6-12 months. This would mean when iOS 15 comes out, we will support that version and all devices running on it as well as iOS 14 for 6-12 months. To see what the latest version of iOS is out, see

 System Requirements for Android Version
-----------------------------------------

Domo currently supports all devices running the latest Android (11) or Android 10 and later. To see what the latest version of Android is out, see
