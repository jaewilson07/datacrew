Shareablee is a strategic marketing intelligence solution empowering brands, content publishers, and agencies to easily get the insights they need to know across all measurable channels of social engagement to drive their most important marketing and business decisions.


 Use Domo's Shareablee connector to retrieve data across social platforms and industry-standard metrics. To learn more about the Shareablee API, visit their page (
