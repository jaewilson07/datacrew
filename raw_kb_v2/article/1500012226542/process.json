The Google Analytics Management API allows for programmatic access to Google Analytics configuration data. With the Google Analytics Management Service Account connector you can generate reports to list all account, property and view (profile) information for a user, or determine which goals are active and access their configured names. A Google Analytics Account is organized into several levels and the Management API Connector provides a way of interacting with the entities at each level.\n\n\n To learn more about the Google Analytics Management API, visit\n\n\n https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3\n\n\n .\n\nYou connect to your Google Analytics Service account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nGoogle Analytics Management Service Account\n\nConnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Google Analytics Service account and create a DataSet, you must have a Google service account JSON key.\n\n\n To generate a Google service account JSON key, do the following:\n\n. In the Google Cloud Platform Console, open the\n **IAM\u00a0& Admin**\n page.\n2. Click\n **Service accounts**\n .\n3. Select your project and click\n **Create Service Account**\n .\n4. In the\n **Service account details**\n section, enter a name and description for the service account.\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n6. Now, in the\n **Grant this service account access to the project**\n section, click\n **Select a role**\n drop down.\n7. Select\n **Project-> Owner**\n .\n8. Click\n **Continue**\n .\n9. Click\n **Done**\n . An overview of your service account will appear.\n10. In the\n **Actions**\n column, click the three dots to expand the menu. Click\n **Manage Keys**\n .\n11. Click\n **Add Key**\n . Select\n **Create new key**\n .\n12. **Create private key**\n window will appear. Select private key type as\n **JSON**\n and click\n **Create**\n .\n13. A private key will be saved to your computer.\n\nConnecting to Your Google Service Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nGoogle Analytics Management Service Account\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nGoogle Analytics Management Service\n\naccount.

You can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\nGoogle Analytics Management Service\n\nAccount\u00a0report you want to run.
