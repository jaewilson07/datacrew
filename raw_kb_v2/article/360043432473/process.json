You can then access, control, sort, analyze, and take action on the data instantly-from your office, the road or home. The connector enables all those reports to be easily imported into Domo. \u00a0For more information about the\u00a0BambooHR API, visit\u00a0their website. (\n\nhttp://www.bamboohr.com/api/documentation/\n\n)\n\n\n You connect to your BambooHR account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BambooHR connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for returning head count, payroll, and recurring reporting.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Employee demographics\n* Salary information\n* Custom reports\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * VP\n* HR director\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 20 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nDo not bring in Personally Identifiable Information (PII) into Domo.

This is the same\u00a0URL you use to log in to the BambooHR web interface. For example:\n\nhttps://companydomainname.bamboohr.com\n* Your BambooHR\u00a0API key. To generate an API key for a given user, do the following:\n\n1. Log in to BambooHR and click\u00a0your name in the upper right hand corner of any page to access the user context menu.\n\t2. Click\n\t **API name**\n\t in the upper right hand corner of any page to access the user context menu.\n\t3. Click\n\t **API Keys**\n\t to open a page in which you can generate an API key.\n\n\n\t For more information about API keys, see\n\n http://www.bamboohr.com/api/documentation/login.php\n\n .\n\nConnecting to Your BambooHR Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the BambooHR Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your BambooHR account.
