Hover over the app card until\n\n*Card options**\n displays.\n2. Select\n\n*Card options**\n >\n **Edit Card**\n . The app editor opens.\n3. Scroll down to see a list of the DataSets powering the app.\n4. Make sure each item has a Domo DataSet selected and fields are mapped to a column in the DataSet.\n\n\n* Check column types\n\n+ Apps require columns to be a specific data type such as text, date, or number. Ensure that each column from the DataSet(s) powering the app match the sample DataSet schema.\n* Use valid column names\n\n+ Avoid special characters in column names, especially periods.\n* Check data to make sure the values are in the proper ranges.\n* Check data to ensure there are no unnecessary null values.\n* If a DataFlow output is used to power the app, check to make sure that no DataFlow data type mismatch occurs.\n* Check for zero-length characters that could have been passed into the Domo DataSet from the DataSet source such as Excel or ODBC, for example. Zero-length characters can be removed in MySQL DataFlows.\n\nCheck Developer Tools\n-------------------------\n\nTo perform these steps, you must be using the Google Chrome brower.\n\n. Hover over the app card until\n\n*Card options**\n displays.\n2. Select\n\n*Card options**\n >\n **Details**\n . The Details view for the app displays.\n3. Right-click on the page and select\n **Inspect**\n . The\u00a0Inspect tool displays.\n4. Navigate to the\n **Network**\n tab of the tool.\n5. With the\n **Network**\n tab open, refresh your Chrome page.\n6. Look for any failed requests in the\n **Network**\n tab. These are shown in red.\u00a0Failed requests may help identify columns that aren't mapped correctly or expose other issues in the app.\n\nContact Engineering Services\n--------------------------------\n\nFor apps built by Domo, you can contact the Engineering Services team about issues by email at\n\nes.maintenance@domo.com\n\n. Please provide the following information in your email:\n\n App name\n* Instance in which it was deployed\n* The error that is occurring\n* Steps to reproduce the error\n* Device and browser information\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360052583893\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005014\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nTroubleshooting for Custom Apps\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,479\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 11/2/2022, 8:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 11/2/2022, 8:37 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "troubleshooting_for_custom_apps", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_custom_visualizations", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZampGAC"}, {"text": "explore_the_appstore", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoMGAS"}]}
