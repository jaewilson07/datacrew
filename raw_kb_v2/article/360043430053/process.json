To filter on multiple non-inclusive columns and conditions, you can create a logical Beast Mode calculation.\n                       \n\n                        For this situation, the Best Mode would look like this:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          CASE\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          WHEN `opportunity_type` = \u2018upsell\u2019 AND `opportunity_won` = \u2018true\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          WHEN `opportunity_type` = \u2018upsell\u2019 AND `opportunity_paused` = \u2018true\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          ELSE \u2018No\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          END\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        How do I filter out certain dates?\n                       \n\n                        Say you want to see how many closed opportunities were won by day in a bar chart, but you want to filter out outliers, such as opportunities that were won within 10 days. To do this, you will want to create a Beast Mode calculation to use in the\n                        \n                         Filter\n                        \n                        field that will calculate the time from opportunity open to closed and then categorize them as\u00a0\u201cYes\u201d or\u00a0\u201cNo\u201d based on whether or not they closed within 10 days.\n                       \n\n                        The Beast Mode you would create to this could be named \u201cOpty Closed within 10 Days?\u201d and look like this:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          CASE\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          WHEN DATEDIFF(`Opportunity_Closed_Date`,`Opportunity_Open_Date`) <= 10 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          WHEN DATEDIFF(`Opportunity_Closed_Date`,`Opportunity_Open_Date`) > 10 THEN \u2018No\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          ELSE \u2018Outlier\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          END\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        How do I find the difference between two date columns without including weekends?\n                       \n\n                        Use a\n                        \n                         DATEDIFF\n                        \n                        function then subtract\u00a02 for every week.\n                       \n\n                        How do I filter data so the summary number matches the value displayed in the card?\n                       \n\n                        Say you have a map card of the United States that calculates\u00a0the sales amount broken out by state, and the summary number shows the total sales amount. However, the total sales amount in the card legend for the United States is lower than the summary number amount. The reason the sales amount in the Summary Number is larger is because the summary number takes into account all sales amounts regardless of country, and the card legend only shows the sales amounts for the United States. For this scenario, you will need to create a Beast Mode calculation that filters out the non-United States sales amounts.\n                       \n\n                        The Beast Mode to do this would look like this:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          CASE\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          WHEN `Country` = \u2018United States\u2019 THEN \u2018Yes\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          ELSE \u2018No\u2019\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          END\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For more information about summary numbers, see\n                        \n                         Configuring Your Chart Summary Number\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Can I do \"percent of total\" functions in Beast Mode?\n                       \n\n                        No, but you can insert a data label into your chart that contains the percent of total value by doing the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          In Analyzer, open\n                          \n                           Chart Properties\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          In\n                          \n                           Data Label Settings\n                          \n                          , enter\n                          \n                           %_PERCENT_OF_TOTAL\n                          \n                          in the\n                          \n                           Text\n                          \n                          field.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Why can't I put Beast Mode calculations in the Filter field?\n                       \n\n\n                         The filter in the Analyzer is based on row-level filtering on the DataSet level, so it doesn\u2019t filter on aggregates. To fix this, you can use the Magic ETL or SQL DataFlow tools to group and aggregate the columns for card and filtering usage.

For example, your card is visualizing the current month by day, so the date values on the x-axis are showing the year, month, and day (for example, 2016-01-15). However, you may only want to see the day and month values (01-15).\n                        \n\n\n\n                         You can change the display of date values so you only see the day and month, using the DATE_FORMAT() function to reformat the date values:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          DATE_FORMAT(`DateColumn`,\u2019%d-%m\u2019)\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can also format dates in using\n                        \n                         Chart Properties\n                        \n                        .

You can shift the dates values to another time zone by adding or subtracting time from the date values depending on what time zone you are switching it to. The functions that add and subtract time are\n                         \n                          DATE_ADD()\n                         \n                         and\n                         \n                          DATE_SUB()\n                         \n                         .

Unfortunately, many users make the mistake of using a SUM function inside of the CASE statement, like the following:\n                       \n\n\n                         CASE WHEN `Column_1` = 'Value_1\u2019 THEN SUM(`Column_1`) END\n                        \n\n\n                        Instead, you need to \u201cwrap\u201d the entire statement in a SUM function for it to execute properly:\n                       \n\n\n                         SUM(CASE WHEN `Column_1` = 'Value_1\u2019 THEN SUM(`Column_1`) END)\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        I've added a shared calculation but it only seems to show up in new cards.

If the Beast Mode is shared on the DataSet, it can also be caused by users editing different cards on the DataSet overwriting each others' changes to the shared Beast Modes on that DataSet.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        This problem can most easily be solved by e\n                        \n\n                          ither coordinating\u00a0with other users to make sure you\u2019re not overwriting each others' changes, or by editing\u00a0at a time when others are\u00a0not as likely to also be making edits.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        This issue also occurs when you attempt to create Beast Mode calculations on a card in a drill path.\u00a0Because drill path cards are not actual cards,\u00a0Beast Mode calculations\u00a0created in a drill path will not be saved.
