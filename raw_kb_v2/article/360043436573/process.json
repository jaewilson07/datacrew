Regardless of the file type you choose (CSV, XLS, or XLSX), there are a wide range of configuration options to meet your custom file needs.\n                       \n\n                        As of our February 2018 release, there are two versions of the File Upload connector\u00a0available in Domo:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The newer\u2014and recommended\u2014version of the connector provides an\u00a0intuitive workflow to make even the most complicated Excel or CSV files usable within Domo. It lets you\u00a0maintain all of the organization and configuration of your custom Excel or CSV files and still have usable data within Domo. Requiring virtually no input, this version does the heavy lifting for you.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The legacy version of this connector is also still available. This version requires you to configure a number of advanced settings (most of which are set\u00a0for you automatically when using the new version of the connector).\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can begin the process of creating\u00a0a File Upload DataSet\u00a0in one of several different ways:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          By going into the Data Center and choosing the\n                          \n                           File\n                          \n                          option from the toolbar at the top of the screen.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          By clicking the\n                          \n                          icon in the upper right corner of the\n                          \n                           Dashboards\n                          \n                          tab, selecting\n                          \n                           Create new Card\n                          \n                          , selecting\n                          \n                           Visualization\n                          \n                          , then clicking\n                          \n                           Upload\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          By clicking\n                          \n                          in the upper right corner of the screen from anywhere in Domo, selecting\n                          \n                           Card\n                          \n                          ,\u00a0selecting\n                          \n                           Visualization\n                          \n                          , then clicking\n                          \n                           Upload\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the File Upload connector user interface.

This means that if you were to create a DataSet from this data, all of the data would be imported into the DataSet, with the Row 1 cells acting as the column headers. This is also reflected in the\n                        \n                         Column Headers\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         Selection\n                        \n                        fields under \"Data Grid,\" in which\n                        \n                         Column Headers\n                        \n                        shows the coordinates for the first and last cells in the first row, and\n                        \n                         Selection\n                        \n                        shows the coordinates for the first and last cells in the body.\n                       \n\n                        The following screenshot shows an example of this initial selection.

In other words, you can toggle the \"active\" selection method by clicking in the field that corresponds to that selection method.\n                       \n\n                        In the following screenshot, the user highlights cell \"A2\" to cell \"E10.\" By default, the\n                        \n                         Selection\n                        \n                        toggle is active, so these cells are considered to be body cells, and the\n                        \n                         Selection\n                        \n                        fields update to reflect the change.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        But, if the user clicks in either\n                        \n                         Column Headers\n                        \n                        cell, then that toggle becomes active. The user then selects the top two rows of data in the preview, and the change is reflected in the\n                        \n                         Column Headers\n                        \n                        fields.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           The Large File Upload Connector discards any empty rows appearing before the table in an XLSX file. So, if the XLSX file has 1 blank row prior to the table, decrease the Column Headers and Selection by 1 row.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Consider the following example:\n                        \n\n\n\n                         To select the range A3:C6, enter Column Headers as A2:C2 and Selection as A3:C5 as there is an empty row before the table.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Format\n                       \n\n                        As mentioned above, by default all Excel spreadsheets brought into Domo are assumed to have column headers instead of row headers or a cross-tab\u00a0(pivot) layout.\u00a0If this is not the case for your data, you can select the correct format in the\n                        \n                         Format\n                        \n                        menu.
