The Domo administrator for the publishing organization creates and maintains the connections to the subscribing organizations from the Domo Everywhere central hub. The admin also configures the authentication for each user within the subscribing organizations. This is called routing.\n                       \n\n                        After routing is configured, the admin must create each subscribing organization within the publishing organization and provide the key attributes for the individual users that are authenticating so that they can be mapped to the appropriate subscribing organizations. After the key attributes are provided, Domo completes the mapping process automatically. The admin can then view the mapping details from within the publishing organization.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        This article describes how to configure publishing organizations and subscriber organizations in the following topics:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Prerequisites\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Routing\n                         \n\n\n\n                            G\n                           \n\n                            rant embed access\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Download/upload routing certificate\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          Subscriber Organization Setup\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Define the key attribute\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Create a subscriber organization\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Remove a subscriber organization\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          Mapping\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Troubleshooting\n                         \n\n\n\n                          FAQ\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        You need to do the following before routing, creation, and mapping:\n                       \n\n\n                         Purchase the Domo Everywhere product.\n                        \n\n                         Configure the publishing organization in Domo.\n                        \n\n                         Identify your organization's authentication method in the following table and obtain any listed information.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             If a third-party system hosts key attributes used to authenticate the identity of your users, choose OIDC or SAML.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Authentication Method\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Description\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            JWT Secret\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             This method requires the simplest implementation.

A Domo admin\n                        \n\n                        can create, update, and delete any number of subscribing organizations based on needs and workflows.\n                       \n\n                        Before you can create a subscriber organization for the first time, you need to define your key attribute. The key attribute is the value that Domo uses to map a user to an organization. To help you determine your key attribute, consider, for your organization, what is the field in a user's profile that comes from your identity provider (IDP)? Common examples are \"customer ID\" and \"partner ID.\" We recommend renaming the\n                        \n                         Key attribute\n                        \n                        field to your preferred value.\n                       \n\n                        After you define your key attribute once, you can then skip this section and begin at\n                        \n                         Creating a Subscriber Organization.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Define the Key Attribute\n                       \n\n                        1.

That template hides the Domo platform header and footer, removes Domo branding, and activates auto-subscription capabilities. However, if you have additional unique needs, you can coordinate additional template changes by contacting your CSM/AE.\n                        \n                        Your custom template\u00a0is then automatically used in the creation of subscriber organizations for that publisher.\n                       \n\n\n                         I need to create multiple subscribers.
