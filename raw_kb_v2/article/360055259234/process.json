You simply drag your DataSets onto a canvas, then add your desired tiles to indicate how the DataSets should be joined and transformed. The curved lines are color-coded according to the DataSet used as an input. The color will persist after a Join tile to show which input DataSet was the main table in the join. A huge list of tiles is available. You can combine columns, filter rows, replace text, and so on. For detailed information about tiles, see the following topics:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Aggregate\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Combine Data\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Data Science\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: DataSets\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Dates and Numbers\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Filter\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Pivot\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Scripting\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Text\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL Tiles: Utility\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n                            There are significant behavioral differences in the new Magic ETL.
