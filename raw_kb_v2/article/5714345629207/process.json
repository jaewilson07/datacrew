For example, in the retail industry, the ability to analyze in detail the relationship between weather conditions around a store and the number of customers and sales enables advanced business optimization and marketing.\n\n\n You connect to your Weathernews account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Weathernews connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n===============\n\nTo connect to your Weathernews account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The API Key for your Weathernews Account.\n\nAPI Keys can be obtained by signing up for\n\nWxTech\u00ae\n\nservice.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Weathernews Account\n========================================\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the Weathernews Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page, Scheduling and Name & Describe Your DataSet, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Credentials Pane\n------------------\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Weathernews account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter your Weathernews API Key.\n  |\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see\n\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n\n above.\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Weathernews credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Weathernews DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n\n**Accounts**\n\n\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Details Pane\n--------------\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n\n\n**Reports**\n\n\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the report you want to run.
