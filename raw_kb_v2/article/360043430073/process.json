For example, to rename a column named \"daily_total\" to \"Daily Total\", create a calculation named \"Daily Total\" with the following code:\n                       \n\n\n                         `daily_total`\n                        \n\n\n                        If you want to sum the column, use the following code:\n                       \n\n\n                         sum(`daily_total`)\n                        \n\n\n                        After saving your calculation, click the new column name in the\n                        \n                         Columns\n                        \n                        list to display the column in your card.\n                       \n\n                        Change Values in a Column\n                       \n\n                        You can use a calculation to change a specified column value to a different value. For example, if you had a column called \"Employee Last Name\" and you wanted to change all instances of \"Janssen\" in the column to \"Janssen-Soderquist,\" you would create a calculation\u00a0with the following code:\n                       \n\n\n                         case when `Employee Last Name` = 'Janssen'\n                         \n                         then 'Janssen-Soderquist'\n                         \n                         else `Employee Last Name`\n                         \n                         end\n                        \n\n\n                        Filter Values in a Column\n                       \n\n                        You can filter values in a column by creating a calculation, then setting a filter to include or exclude the fields with the value you want. For example, assume you have a column of US states and you want to filter out\n                        \n                         State = TX\n                        \n                        , use this code:\n                       \n\n\n                         case when `State` = 'TX'\n                         \n                         then 0\n                         \n                         else 1\n                         \n                         end\n                        \n\n\n                        Then set a filter\u00a0where the column does not include 0.\n                       \n\n                        Alternately, if you have multiple values you want to filter out:\n                       \n\n\n                         case when `State` in ('NY', 'TX')\n                         \n                         then 0\n                         \n                         else 1\n                         \n                         end\n                        \n\n\n                        Then set a filter where the column does not include 0.\n                       \n\n                        Or, when looking for patterns:\n                       \n\n\n                         case\n                         \n                         when `State` like '%TX%' then 0\n                         \n                         when `State` like '%NY%' then 0\n                         \n                         else 1\n                         \n                         end\n                        \n\n\n                        Then set a filter where the column does not include 0.\n                       \n\n                        Force a Sort Order\n                       \n\n                        You can tell Beast Mode to sort data the way you want.\n                       \n\n\n                         CASE\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Requested' THEN 1\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'In Development' THEN 2\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Code Complete' THEN 3\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Data Mapping' THEN 4\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Ready' THEN 5\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Deployer' THEN 6\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Forecasted' THEN 7\n                         \n                         WHEN `Development Status` = 'Hold' THEN 8 ELSE 0\n                         \n                         END\n                        \n\n\n                        Sort by the column with numerical values.\n                       \n\n                        Remove Numbers from Text\n                       \n\n                        To remove numbers from text fields (for example, the fields include a name and ID number and you want just the names), use a Beast Mode calculation like this:\n                       \n\n\n                         SUBSTRING(`text_Field`,INSTR(`text_Field`,' ')+1)\n                        \n\n\n                        Replace the\n                        \n                         text_Field\n                        \n                        text with the name of the column you want to remove numbers from.
