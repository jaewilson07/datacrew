For example, to rename a column named \"daily\\_total\" to \"Daily Total\", create a calculation named \"Daily Total\" with the following code:\n\n\n``daily_total``\n\n\n If you want to sum the column, use the following code:\n\n\n`sum(`daily_total`)`\n\n\n After saving your calculation, click the new column name in the\n **Columns**\n list to display the column in your card.\n\n\n Change Values in a Column\n---------------------------\n\nYou can use a calculation to change a specified column value to a different value. For example, if you had a column called \"Employee Last Name\" and you wanted to change all instances of \"Janssen\" in the column to \"Janssen-Soderquist,\" you would create a calculation\u00a0with the following code:\n\n\n`case when `Employee Last Name` = 'Janssen'\n\n\n then 'Janssen-Soderquist'\n\n\n else `Employee Last Name`\n\n\n end`\n\n\n Filter Values in a Column\n---------------------------\n\nYou can filter values in a column by creating a calculation, then setting a filter to include or exclude the fields with the value you want. For example, assume you have a column of US states and you want to filter out\n `State = TX`\n , use this code:\n\n\n`case when `State` = 'TX'\n\n\n then 0\n\n\n else 1\n\n\n end`\n\n\n Then set a filter\u00a0where the column does not include 0.\n\n\n Alternately, if you have multiple values you want to filter out:\n\n\n`case when `State` in ('NY', 'TX')\n\n\n then 0\n\n\n else 1\n\n\n end`\n\n\n Then set a filter where the column does not include 0.\n\n\n Or, when looking for patterns:\n\n\n`case\n\n\n when `State` like '%TX%' then 0\n\n\n when `State` like '%NY%' then 0\n\n\n else 1\n\n\n end`\n\n\n Then set a filter where the column does not include 0.\n\n\n Force a Sort Order\n--------------------\n\nYou can tell Beast Mode to sort data the way you want.\n\n\n`CASE\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Requested' THEN 1\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'In Development' THEN 2\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Code Complete' THEN 3\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Data Mapping' THEN 4\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Ready' THEN 5\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Deployer' THEN 6\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Forecasted' THEN 7\n\n\n WHEN `Development Status` = 'Hold' THEN 8 ELSE 0\n\n\n END`\n\n\n Sort by the column with numerical values.\n\n\n Remove Numbers from Text\n--------------------------\n\nTo remove numbers from text fields (for example, the fields include a name and ID number and you want just the names), use a Beast Mode calculation like this:\n\n\n`SUBSTRING(`text_Field`,INSTR(`text_Field`,' ')+1)`\n\n\n Replace the\n\ntext\\_Field\n\ntext with the name of the column you want to remove numbers from. This will give you the string from the first space to the right.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043430073\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004079\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSample Beast Mode Calculations: Basic Transforms\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 6,652\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:20 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "sample_beast_mode_calculations_basic_transforms", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "beast_mode", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanAGAS"}]}
