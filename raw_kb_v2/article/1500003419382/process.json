Each task in a project is represented as a horizontal bar with a start date and end date. Tasks are represented along the vertical axis, and dates are represented along the horizontal axis. You can break tasks down by project, in which case each project is shown in a different color and appears as a legend item. However, projects are optional in Gantt charts.\u00a0The Dependency Gantt chart handles changes in dates for you and gives many new display options to communicate project timelines.\n                       \n\n                        Powering Dependency Gantt charts\n                       \n\n                        Dependency Gantt charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for tasks, one with start dates for each task, and one for end dates for each task.\u00a0If you want, you can also add an additional column containing project category data to a Gantt chart. Adding project category data to a Gantt chart causes the bars for each category to appear in different colors, indicating multiple projects. Also, a legend is added to the chart showing you which project category is which.\n                       \n\n                        For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Gantt chart.
