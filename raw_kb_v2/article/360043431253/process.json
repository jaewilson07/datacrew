To create new Google AdWords via Google BigQuery\u00a0DataSets, use this connector. All pre-existing AdWords via BigQuery DataSets will continue to run normally.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nGoogle Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is an online advertising service. Use Domo's Google Ads\u00a0via BigQuery\u00a0Service connector to transfer and pull data from a specific project into Domo.\u00a0To successfully configure this connector, you must first configure a Google BigQuery script within your Google Ads\u00a0account. The steps for doing this are provided later in this article.\n\n\n For more information about the Google Ads API, see\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/adword...s/guides/start\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Google Ads via Google BigQuery\u00a0Service connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a BigQuery service account,\u00a0you must have a Google BigQuery\u00a0service account JSON key. To generate a key, do the following:\n\n. In the GCP Console, open the\n **IAM\u00a0& Admin**\n page.\n2. Click\n ****Service accounts****\n in the left-hand navigation pane.\n3. Select your project and click\n ****Open****\n .\n4. Click\n ****Create Service Account****\n .\n5. Enter a name and description for the service account.\n6. Click\n ****Create****\n .\n\n*Note:**\n You may need the \u201cBigQuery Admin\u201d role in the service account permissions dialog. Please consult with your Google administrator for additional guidance.\n7. Select\n ****Project Owner****\n .\n8. Click\n ****Continue****\n .\n9. Click\n ****Create key****\n .\n10. Select\n ****JSON****\n as the key type.\n11. Click\n ****Create****\n .\n\nA private key will be saved to your computer.\n\n\n Connecting to Google Ads via Google BigQuery\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Google Ads via Google BigQuery\u00a0Service Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to Google Ads via BigQuery. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Service Account Key JSON\n  |\n Copy and paste the JSON for your BigQuery\u00a0service account key. For information about creating a key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered a valid key,\u00a0you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google Ads via BigQuery\u00a0Service DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields and menus you can use to configure your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Project ID\n  |\n Enter the name of the specific project you want to add your DataSet to.

explained in the next section.\n\n\n Configuring a BigQuery Script in Google Ads\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis section explains how to configure a BigQuery\u00a0script in Google Ads. After you have configured the script, you should be able to use the BigQuery Service connector to pull in data just as you would any other connector.\n\n\n**To configure a BigQuery script in Google Ads,**\n\n. Configure your connector settings as explaned above.\n2. Copy the script from the\n **Query Preview**\n pane.\n3. Sign into your account in Google Ads.\n4. Click the wrench icon in the top right corner of the screen.\n5. Click\n **Scripts**\n (which is found under \"Bulk Actions\").\n6. Click the plus button to create a new script.\n7. Name the script, then click\n **Authorize**\n .\n8. Select\n **Advanced APIs**\n .\n9. Check the\n **Bigquery**\n box.\n10. Paste the script you copied in step 4 into the textbox.\n11. Click\n **Preview**\n .\n12. (Conditional) If any error messages appear after you preview, follow their instructions.\n\n\n For example, you may be prompted to click on another link to authorize BigQuery or reauthorize.\n13. Click\n **Run**\n when your configuration is successful.\n\n\n Google Ads\u00a0now takes you back to the main page, where you are prompted to set up how often a script runs.\n14. Click the pencil icon under \"Frequency,\" then set the schedule for your script.\n15. Return to the Google Ads via Google BigQuery\u00a0Service connector page in Domo\u00a0and continue configuring the connector.\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nIf the data doesn't seem to be updating, make sure your Google Ads\u00a0script runs before the connector runs. Otherwise, the same data will be pulled again.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043431253\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003773\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle Ads via Google BigQuery Service Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,739\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_ads_via_google_bigquery_service_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
