****Important****
****:****
 Due to Google’s change in allowing Domo connectors to use OAuth authentication, all users must now use service account key authentication to create new data connections. To create new Google AdWords via Google BigQuery DataSets, use this connector. All pre-existing AdWords via BigQuery DataSets will continue to run normally.

Intro
-------

Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is an online advertising service. Use Domo's Google Ads via BigQuery Service connector to transfer and pull data from a specific project into Domo. To successfully configure this connector, you must first configure a Google BigQuery script within your Google Ads account. The steps for doing this are provided later in this article.


 For more information about the Google Ads API, see

https://developers.google.com/adword...s/guides/start

.


 This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Ads via Google BigQuery Service connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to a BigQuery service account, you must have a Google BigQuery service account JSON key. To generate a key, do the following:

. In the GCP Console, open the
 **IAM & Admin**
 page.
2. Click
 ****Service accounts****
 in the left-hand navigation pane.
3. Select your project and click
 ****Open****
 .
4. Click
 ****Create Service Account****
 .
5. Enter a name and description for the service account.
6. Click
 ****Create****
 .

*Note:**
 You may need the “BigQuery Admin” role in the service account permissions dialog. Please consult with your Google administrator for additional guidance.
7. Select
 ****Project Owner****
 .
8. Click
 ****Continue****
 .
9. Click
 ****Create key****
 .
10. Select
 ****JSON****
 as the key type.
11. Click
 ****Create****
 .

A private key will be saved to your computer.

 Configuring a BigQuery Script in Google Ads
---------------------------------------------

This section explains how to configure a BigQuery script in Google Ads. After you have configured the script, you should be able to use the BigQuery Service connector to pull in data just as you would any other connector.


**To configure a BigQuery script in Google Ads,**

. Configure your connector settings as explaned above.
2. Copy the script from the
 **Query Preview**
 pane.
3. Sign into your account in Google Ads.
4. Click the wrench icon in the top right corner of the screen.
5. Click
 **Scripts**
 (which is found under "Bulk Actions").
6. Click the plus button to create a new script.
7. Name the script, then click
 **Authorize**
 .
8. Select
 **Advanced APIs**
 .
9. Check the
 **Bigquery**
 box.
10. Paste the script you copied in step 4 into the textbox.
11. Click
 **Preview**
 .
12. (Conditional) If any error messages appear after you preview, follow their instructions.


 For example, you may be prompted to click on another link to authorize BigQuery or reauthorize.
13. Click
 **Run**
 when your configuration is successful.


 Google Ads now takes you back to the main page, where you are prompted to set up how often a script runs.
14. Click the pencil icon under "Frequency," then set the schedule for your script.
15. Return to the Google Ads via Google BigQuery Service connector page in Domo and continue configuring the connector.

.


 Troubleshooting
-----------------

If the data doesn't seem to be updating, make sure your Google Ads script runs before the connector runs. Otherwise, the same data will be pulled again.
