You need an easier way to configure how each person accesses only the appropriate data.\n                        \n\n                        Dynamic PDP makes your job easier. Instead of selecting individual values in specific columns to pertain to users or groups, you select a column and\u00a0a user attribute, and Domo takes care of the rest, only allowing\u00a0people to see the rows that match that user attribute. And because user attributes must be locked by an \"Admin\"-level user before they can be used in a PDP policy, you can feel just as secure as when you use a standard PDP policy.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating and Deleting PDP Policies\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Custom PDP\u00a0Filters\n                       \n\n                        For more precise control over\u00a0the rows used in PDP policies, use custom PDP filters. This allows you to set rules for values that are returned, using general filter conditions such as \"is greater than,\" \"is between,\" \"begins with,\" and so on. For example, if you had a subset of users who should only be allowed to view data within a certain date range, you could create such a filter here.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating and Deleting PDP Policies\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        PDP on DataFusions\n                       \n\n                        Scaling and security go hand in hand now that\u00a0DataFusions support Personalized Data Permissions.\u00a0Build powerful, scalable DataFusions and use PDP to\u00a0control access. PDP can be applied to either the\u00a0inputs to the Fusion, the DataFusion output\u00a0itself, or\u00a0both. Domo seamlessly calculates across all your data\u00a0so your users only see what they\u2019re supposed to see.\n                       \n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         PDP and DataFlows\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Domo Stories\n                       \n\n                        Domo Stories allow you to easily create beautiful Domo\u00a0Dashboards with powerful narratives. Because each layout has been optimized individually for web, mobile, tablet, print, and Scheduled Reports, each Domo Stories Dashboard tells a consistent story\u00a0no matter where it's viewed.\n                        \n\n                        You can create your own Card layout, or choose from one of over 100 template options to bridge the gap between understanding the data and taking action. Domo Stories\u00a0also create consistency and clarity as they use pre-established templates. This ensures that different device restrictions don\u2019t change the meaning and context of a story.\n                        \n\n                        Domo Stories give\u00a0you more freedom to tell your data stories\u00a0and communicate the things that matter most to your end users.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        When building Domo Stories Dashboards, you can do all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Create the exact layout you want by adding card slots then resizing.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Add new Card layouts based on a variety of Domo Stories templates.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Drag and drop Cards into the slots in the layouts you have added.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Create new Cards in empty slots.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Resize templates and the Cards within them by dragging their borders.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Swap Cards in a layout by dragging one card on top of another.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Add headers and borders.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Add images and\u00a0Notebook Card content inline, without having to first open the Doc Card\u00a0upload screen\u00a0or\u00a0Notebook Card editor.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Change the background color of your Page and\u00a0individual Cards.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Specify which Card elements appear (for example, you could hide the Summary Number for a Card).\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Define the actions that take place when a user clicks on a Card.

Get insights in second that used to require extensive Page filtering or additional clicking in and out of Details.\u00a0Analysis of your business data has never been this easy.\n                       \n\n                        With Card-to-Card Filtering, you can also click on a chart element to apply a filter for that element to all cards in the page. For example, if you clicked on the bar for \"2014-Jan,\" all cards would be filtered to that month. This also works for rows in tables. You can turn off this filter by clicking the element again.\n                       \n\n                        Card-to-Card Filters are automatically enabled in Domo Stories\u00a0Pages. To turn on Card-to-Card\u00a0Filters in standard Pages, first turn on Page Filters by selecting\n                        \n\n\n                          > Turn on Page Filters\n                         \n\n                        .\u00a0An\n                        \n\n                          Interaction Filters\n                         \n\n                        toggle appears and is turned on by default. You can disable or reenable Card-to-Card Filters\u00a0by clicking this toggle. If you turn off page filters, Card-to-Card\u00a0Filters also turn off.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about Card-to-Card Filters, see\n                        \n                         Applying Page-Level Filters\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Filter Chart Types\n                       \n\n                        New Filter chart types\u2014Slicer, Checkbox, Radio Button, Range, and Date Selector\u2014make\u00a0filtering data on a card page even easier. Once you have added a Filter Chart Card to a Page, anyone viewing it can click on one or more values to filter the other Cards on the Page.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Slicer\n                          \n                          ,\n                          \n                           Checkbox\n                          \n                          , and\n                          \n                           Radio Button\n                          \n                          charts are all used to filter on specific values.\u00a0For example, you could create a Card with a Slicer chart\u00a0containing\u00a0names of U.S. states and add it to a Page. If you then clicked \"Texas\" and \"Oklahoma,\" all of the Cards in the Page would be filtered to show only data for those states. With Slicer and Checkbox charts, anyone can apply as many filters at a time as they want. With Radio Button charts, users can apply only one filter at a time.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Date Selector\n                          \n                          charts\u00a0are used to filter on a specified date range. For example, you could build a Card with a Date Selector chart containing\u00a0a 2014\u00a0calendar. If a user then selected all dates from February to June, all other Cards in the Page would filter to show data for those dates.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Range\n                          \n                          charts are used to filter values within a range using a slider. For example, you could build a Card with a Range chart\u00a0with a minimum value of $2000 and a maximum value of $4000. Viewers\u00a0could then narrow the range using the slider buttons, and the other Cards in the\u00a0Page would update to show data for that range of values.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can apply filters from multiple Cards. These should apply to any card so long as all of the selected criteria pass the filters. If any filter you have selected doesn't apply to a card, an \"Out of range\" error appears.\n                       \n\n                        Cards with Filter charts\u00a0only work when Card-to-Card Filters are turned on. If Card-to-Card \u00a0Filters are not turned on, clicking a filter opens the Details view for the card instead of applying the filter.\n                       \n\n\n                         Slicer Card\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Checkbox Card\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Radio Button Card\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Range Card\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Date Selector Card\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        You build Filter cards in Analyzer,\u00a0just like any other chart type.

These additional dimensions are represented in the chart by overlaying boxes on top of each grouping. For example, the following Grouped Bar chart shows revenue by product by campaign by lead source.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Note that this functionality is intended to be used with\n                        \n                         string\n                        \n                        columns, not date columns. To add date grouping to a chart, it is recommended that you use Tiered Dates, the next item in this list.\n                       \n\n                        Trellis Chart functionality is available for all graph types that utilize series data, like Bar graphs, Line graphs, and Area graphs.\n                       \n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Tiered Dates\n                       \n\n                        Tiered Dates allow\u00a0greater ease of understanding by presenting multiple time periods in a single view.
