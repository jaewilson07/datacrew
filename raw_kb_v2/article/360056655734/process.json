The main overview Company Productivity Card displays where employees are working and high-level productivity metrics for your business systems. Individual Tool Tracker Cards for each system highlight more detailed metrics, along with trends over the last 30 days and comparisons to your data from yesterday.

The system calculates your highest productivity over the last 90 days, then tells you your current percentage of attainment to that high. You can see participation in each activity, and even compare productivity estimates for when people are working in the office versus working at home.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             This app\u00a0is part of the\n                             \n                              Get Back to Work Solution\n                             \n                             and is\u00a0available\n                             \n                              on-demand and paid\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            To request this feature be enabled,\n                           \n\n\n\n                              Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager\u00a0or Account Executive.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n                               If you do not have contact information for your CSM or AE, contact Domo Support.
