Intro
-------

SAP ASE (Adaptive Server Enterprise), formerly known as Sybase SQL Server, is a relational model database server product for businesses. Use Domo's SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise SSH connector to retrieve data from an SAP database via an SSH tunnel by inputting an SQL query. To learn more about SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise, visit their page (

https://www.sap.com/products/sybase-ase.html

).


 You connect to a SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise database in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise SSH connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to an SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The username and password you use to log into your SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise account
* The host name for the database
* The port number for the database
* The database name
* The SSH hostname
* The username and password for the SSH user
* The SSH port number
* The SSH private key

Before you can connect to an SAP database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the port you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see

Whitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors

.


**Note: Domo does not support the SSH keys generated using ssh-keygen. The SSH keys need to be the DES or RSA keys (in PEM format) generated by OpenSSL.**

 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise SSH Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.
