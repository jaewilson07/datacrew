Intro
-------


 You can sign in to

Domo

using a Single Sign-On (

SSO

) solution from Active Directory Federation Services.

You must have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Company Settings" enabled to enable SSO. For more information about default roles, see

Managing Custom Roles

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To use AD FS to log in to Domo, your system must have the following components:

 An Active Directory instance in which all Domo users have an email address attribute.
* A Domo instance that has the Single Sign-On feature switched on.
* A server running Microsoft Server 2012 or 2008.
* An SSL certificate to sign your AD FS login page and the fingerprint for the certificate.

After you meet these basic requirements, you must install AD FS on your server. Configuring and installing AD FS is beyond the scope of this topic, but is detailed in this

Microsoft KB article

.


 When you have a fully installed AD FS installation, note down the value for the "SAML 2.0/W-Federation" URL in the AD FS Endpoints section. If you chose the defaults for the installation, this will be "/adfs/ls/."


 Adding a Relying Party Trust

 **Trust Relationships > Relying Party Trusts**
 .
