Configuring and installing AD FS is beyond the scope of this topic, but is detailed in this\n\nMicrosoft KB article\n\n.\n\n\n When you have a fully installed AD FS installation, note down the value for the \"SAML 2.0/W-Federation\" URL in the AD FS Endpoints section. If you chose the defaults for the installation, this will be \"/adfs/ls/.\"\n\n\n Adding a Relying Party Trust\n------------------------------\n\nAfter you have configured AD FS on your server with certificates, you are ready to add Domo as a relying party trust.\n\n\n**To add a relying party trust,**\n\n. Open AD FS.\n2. In the folders list on the left side of the screen, select\n **Trust Relationships > Relying Party Trusts**\n .\n3. In the pane on the right side of the screen, click\n **Add Relying Party Trust**\n .\n\n\n The\n **Add Relying Party Trust**\n wizard opens.\n4. Click\n **Start**\n .\n5. Select\n **Enter data about the relying party manually**\n then click\n **Next**\n .\n6. In the\n **Display name**\n field, enter the application name that you want users to see, then click\n **Next**\n .\n7. Select\n **AD FS Profile**\n , then click\n **Next**\n .\n8. Click\n **Next**\n in the\n **Configure Certificate**\n screen.\n9. In Domo, select\n **More\u00a0>**\n**Admin**\n .\n\n\n The Admin Settings opens.\n10. Expand\n **Authentication**\n , then select\n **SAML (SSO)**\n .\n11. Copy the\n **SAML Assertion Endpoint URL**\n .\n12. In AD FS, in the\n **Configure URL**\n screen, select\n **Enable support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol**\n .\n13. Paste the SAML Assertion Endpoint URL into the text field, then select\n **Next**\n .\n14. In the\n **Configure Identifiers**\n screen, enter\n\nsubdomain*\n .\n\ndomo.com\n\n\n , in the\n **Relying party trust identifier**\n field, replacing\n\nsubdomain\n\nwith your company\u2019s Domo subdomain. This URL must match that in the\n **Entity ID**\n field \u00a0in the\n **Admin**\n**> Authentication > SAML (SSO)**\n tab in Domo.\n15. Click\n **Add**\n to add the URL as a trust identifier.\n16. Click\n **Next**\n .\n17. In the\n **Configure Multifactor Authentication Now**\n screen, click\n **Next**\n .\n18. In the\n **Choose Issuance Authorization Rules**\n screen, choose whether you want to permit or deny all users when they attempt to log in to your company's Domo instance, then click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n If you choose to deny all users, you can create rules later to permit only those users that you specify in your Domo instance.\n19. In the\n **Ready to Add Trust**\n screen, click\n **Next**\n .\n20. In the\n **Finish**\n screen, ensure that the box is checked, then click\n **Close**\n .\n\nCreating claim rules\n----------------------\n\nIn this set of steps, you must set claim rules in AD FS.\n\n. In AD FS,\u00a0select the relying party trust you created in the previous set of steps then click\n **Edit Claim Rules**\n .\n\n\n The\n **Edit Claim Rules**\n wizard opens.\n2. Click\n **Add Rule**\n .\n3. In the\n **Claim rule template**\n dropdown, select\n **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims**\n , then click\n **Next**\n .\n4. In the\n **Claim rule name**\n field, enter \"Domo Claims.\"\n5. In the\n **Attribute store**\n field, select\n **Active Directory**\n .\n6. Map the outgoing claim types as outlined below:\n\n\n|\n LDAP\u00a0Attribute\n  |\n Outgoing Claim Type\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n E-Mail-Addresses (required)\n  |\n email\n  |\n|\n Display-Name (required)\n  |\n Name\n  |\n|\n Is-Member-of-DL\n  |\n Group\n  |\n|\n Title\n  |\n Title\n  |\n\n*Note:**\n Any groups you include are treated as user groups in Domo. For more information about user groups, see\n\nUser and Group Management\n\n.\n7. Click\n **Finish**\n .\n8. Click\n **Apply**\n .\n9. Click\n **OK**\n to close the wizard.\n\nSetting access to Domo (conditional)\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you chose to deny all users access to Domo in the previous set of steps, you must add Issuance Authorizations for the users you want in Domo.\n\n\n**To add Issuance Authorizations,**\n\n. In AD FS, start the\n **Edit Claim Rules**\n wizard for the relying party trust you created.\n2. Open the\n **Issuance Authorization Rules**\n tab.\n3. Click\n **Add Rule**\n .\n4. In the\n **Choose Rule Type**\n screen, click\n **Next**\n .\n5. In the\n **Configure Claim Rule**\n screen, enter a name for the rule in the\n **Claim rule name**\n field.\n6. Specify the claims and values that are to be used to permit or deny access to Domo.\n7. Click\n **Finish**\n .\n8. Click\n **Apply**\n .\n9. Click\n **OK**\n to close the wizard.\n\nConfiguring Domo with AD FS (conditional)\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have not already copied your signing certificate to a known file location, follow the steps in this section.\n\n\n**To configure Domo with AD FS,**\n\n. In AD FS, select\n **Service > Certificates**\n in the folders panel.\n2. Select the token-signing certificate.\n3. Click\n **View Certificate**\n .\n4. Open the\n **Details**\n tab.\n5. Select\n **Copy to File**\n .\n6. Save the certificate as a Base-64 encoded X.509 file to a known location.\n7. Click\n **Finish**\n .\n8. In Domo, select\n **More**\n**>**\n**Admin**\n .\n\n\n The Admin Settings opens.\n9. Expand\n **Authentication**\n , then select\n **SAML (SSO)**\n .\n10. In the\n **Identity Endpoint URL**\n field, enter the location where Domo should send the SAMLRequest.\n\n\n This is usually the name of your AD FS server followed by\n\n/adfs/ls/\n\n. For example:\n\n\n ssp.example.com/adfs/ls/\n\n\n .\n11. In the\n **Entity ID**\n field, enter the unique identifier you used in the Relying Party Trust\u00a0setup\u00a0(\n\nsubdomain*\n .\n\ndomo.com\n\n\n ).\n12. Upload the token-signing certificate into Domo.\n13. Indicate whether you want to import LDAP groups into Domo automatically.\n14. Click\n **Test Connection**\n to verify that the configuration works.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043439013\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003048\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nEnabling SSO with Active Directory Federation Services\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,964\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:05 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "enabling_sso_with_active_directory_federation_services", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "administrating_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamlGAC"}, {"text": "implementing_sso", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanoGAC"}]}
