To learn more about the Drchrono API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.drchrono.com/api/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Drchrono account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Drchrono connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Drchrono account and create a DataSet, you must have your Drchrono username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Drchrono Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Drchrono Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Drchrono connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Drchrono accounts in Domo) to open the Drchrono OAuth screen where you can enter your Drchrono\u00a0username and password. Once you have entered valid Drchrono credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Drchrono DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Drchrono when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Drchrono.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Drchrono report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Appointments\n  |\n Retrieves a list of appointments.\n  |\n|\n Appointment Profiles\n  |\n Retrieves appointment profile data.\n  |\n|\n Doctors\n  |\n Retrieves a list of doctors.\n  |\n|\n Offices\n  |\n Retrieves a list of offices.\n  |\n|\n Patients Summary\n  |\n Retrieves a summary of patient data.\n  |\n|\n Transactions\n  |\n Retrieves transaction data.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Retrieves a list of users.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Start Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days for which you want your report to begin pulling data.
