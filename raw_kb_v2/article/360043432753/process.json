This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BEA connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your BEA account and create a DataSet, you must have a BEA API key. This API key is provided to you by email after you register at\n\nhttps://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your BEA Account\n--------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the BEA Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your BEA account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter your BEA API key.\u00a0This API key is provided to you by email after you register at\n\nhttps://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid BEA credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new BEA DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the BEA report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Direct Investment\n  |\n Retrieves income and financial transactions in direct investment that underlie the U.S. balance of payments statistics, and direct investment positions that underlie the U.S. international investment positions.\n  |\n|\n Fixed Assets\n  |\n Retrieves data from the standard set of Fixed Assets tables as published online.\n  |\n|\n GDP by Industry (Gross Domestic Product by Industry)\n  |\n Retrieves estimates for value added, gross output, intermediate inputs, KLEMS and employment statistics, in both current and chained (real) dollars.\n  |\n|\n IIP (International Investment Position)\n  |\n Retrieves data on the U.S. international investment position.
