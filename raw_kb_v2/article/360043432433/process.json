To learn more about the\u00a0Velocify API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://service.leads360.com/ClientService.asmx\n\n).\n\n\n There are two versions of the Velocify connector\u2014this standard version and an advanced version. The only difference between these is that the advanced version allows you to pull in custom reports from Velocify, whereas the standard version does not. For information about the standard version, see\n\nVelocify Advanced Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The Velocify connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Velocify account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Velocify connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing\u00a0DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Velocify account and create a DataSet, you must have a Velocify username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Velocify Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Velocify Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Velocify account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Velocify account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to log into your Velocify account.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Velocify credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Velocify DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\nAccounts\n\ntab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a menu in which you select a Velocify report, along with other menus that may or may not appear depending on your selected report.\u00a0The following table describes all of the reports you can create using the\u00a0Velocify connector.\n\n\n**Tip:**\n Velocify allows users to create a custom report through their UI, which is then accessible through the API. If you want to connect to a custom report in Domo, you can do so using the Velocify Advanced connector. If you would like to use this connector, speak to your Domo CSR.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Agents\n  |\n Returns a list of users in your database.\n  |\n|\n Campaigns\n  |\n Returns a list of campaigns in your database.\n  |\n|\n Leads\n  |\n Returns a list of leads that have been generated during the past 30 days.\n  |\n|\n Milestones\n  |\n Returns a list of lead milestones in your database.\n  |\n|\n Programs\n  |\n Returns a list of lead distribution programs in your database.\n  |\n|\n Providers\n  |\n Returns a list of lead provider integrations in your database.\n  |\n|\n Reports\n  |\n Returns a list of reports you have access to.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Past Days (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to retrieve data for.

Other than that, the available reports are the same.\n\n####\n Can I use the same account to create multiple DataSets?\n\nYes.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043432433\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004917\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nVelocify Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,385\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/31/2022, 7:55 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 11/1/2022, 7:19 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "velocify_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
