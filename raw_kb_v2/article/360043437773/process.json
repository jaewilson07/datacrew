You can set a report schedule for a dashboard or for an individual card on a dashboard. You can send reports to users inside or outside your organization; however, users outside your organization must be in your list of authorized domains. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Specifying Authorized Domains for Invited Users\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Users receive scheduled reports via email. Reports for a card include an image of that card; reports for a dashboard include images of all cards on that dashboard. You can select a card\u00a0image to open the card Details view directly in Domo, or a dashboard image to open that dashboard. The image used for a given card is the same as the \"Large\" view of the card in a dashboard; therefore, any information in a card that does not appear in the dashboard view will likewise not appear in the report version (such as the \"Total\" value that appears in the Details for a Pie graph).\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Card descriptions are not supported in scheduled reports. If a description for a card is enabled, that description does not display in a report for the card or for a dashboard that contains the card.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        You can access the Scheduled Reports if you have a default security role of Participant or higher or a custom role with the Export from Domo grant enabled. Participant-level users can only create scheduled reports at the dashboard level; they cannot send single cards as reports. For more information about default security roles, see\n                        \n                         Managing Custom Roles\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             Domo recommends that you do not schedule reports on cards found on the Overview Page, as this can cause issues when the cards are sent automatically. A best practice is to move the cards from the Overview Page before using them in scheduled reports.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - Scheduled Reports Overview\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Caveats\n                       \n\n\n\n                          There is a 10 MB limit on email size for standard Pages and a 5 MB limit on Domo dashboards.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The following email clients are supported (use of any other email client may or may not result in successful rendering or viewing of Scheduled Reports):\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Any web-based email client (i.e. Gmail, Outlook Web App, etc.)\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Microsoft Outlook\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Apple Mail\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n                            Domo only supports the two most recent non-beta versions of email clients.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Parts of the Scheduled Reports edit dialog\n                       \n\n                        In the Scheduled Reports edit dialog, you can schedule reports and specify who receives the report emails.
