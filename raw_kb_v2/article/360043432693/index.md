Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of web services that make up a cloud computing platform by

Amazon.com

.  For more information about the AWS API, visit their website. (

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/...tication2.html

)


 You connect to your AWS account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the AWS connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your AWS account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:


 You must have the access rights to work with the connector

 Your AWS access key
* Your AWS secret key
* You must have the required permission to access the connector.

For information about obtaining these keys, refer to the following article:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimple...edentials.html

.


 You must also set up an S3 bucket with a scheduled push of ZIP files to use this connector. For more information, consult Amazon's documentation at

 This section enumerates the options in the

 **Details**
 panes in the AWS Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 Trobleshooting
----------------


#####
 Error message, "Failed to authenticate. Verify the credentials and try again. Domo is ready, but the credentials you entered are invalid. Verify your account credentials and try again." appears while trying to connect to the connector.

This issue is related to authentication. You must have the required permission to use this connector.


 FAQ
-----


#####
 My AWS DataSet is returning an error of “Domo is ready, but Redshift returned: ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block.” What do I do?

This error is caused by a connection issue between AWS and Domo servers. This is an intermittent error that usually self-resolves. If it does not, you will need to submit a bug report to determine if the connector needs to have autocommit turned on.

####
 Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?

The connector only supports the Cost and Usage report. Amazon AWS is ending support for all other reports at a future date.

####
 How often can the data be updated?

Due to large API returns from Amazon AWS, the data should only be updated once per day.
