This is an intermittent error that usually self-resolves. If it does not, you will need to submit a bug report to determine if the connector needs to have autocommit turned on.\n                       \n\n                        Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n                       \n\n                        The connector only supports the Cost and Usage report.
