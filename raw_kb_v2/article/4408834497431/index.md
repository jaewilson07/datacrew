Intro
-------


 PII Vault privacy compliance is accomplished through Poly-Anonymization. Poly-Anonymization involves taking any personal identifying pieces of information and swapping it out for our Poly-Anonymous Identifier (Poly-Id). The Anonomatic Augmented Writeback Connector takes a Domo dataset and uses the Anonomatic service to anonymize the data, and then writes it back to another Domo dataset. To power up this connector, you need your PII Vault Container host, port and service account ID, and the API key for your PII Vault service.

You configure your Domo-

PIIVault Container

connection in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the

Anonomatic Augmented Writeback

Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

*Note:**
 The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.

Prerequisites
---------------

To configure this Connector, you must have the following:

 The host of your PIIVault Container
* The port number of your PIIVault Container
* Your PIIVault Service Account ID
* The API Key for your PIIVault service

Configuring the Connection
----------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the

Anonomatic Augmented Writeback

Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 Input DataSet ID
  |

Enter the ID of your Domo dataset containing PII data to anonymize with PIIVault Anonomatic service.

You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following

datasources/

.


 For example, in the URL

https://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview

, the DataSet ID is

845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.
