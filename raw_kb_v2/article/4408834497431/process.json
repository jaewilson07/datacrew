Poly-Anonymization involves taking any personal identifying pieces of information and swapping it out for our Poly-Anonymous Identifier (Poly-Id). The Anonomatic Augmented Writeback Connector takes a Domo dataset and uses the Anonomatic service to anonymize the data, and then writes it back to another Domo dataset. To power up this connector, you need your PII Vault Container host, port and service account ID, and the API key for your PII Vault service.\n\nYou configure your Domo-\n\nPIIVault Container\n\nconnection in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nAnonomatic Augmented Writeback\n\nConnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this Connector, you must have the following:\n\n The host of your PIIVault Container\n* The port number of your PIIVault Container\n* Your PIIVault Service Account ID\n* The API Key for your PIIVault service\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nAnonomatic Augmented Writeback\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your PIIVault container. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host of your PIIVault Container.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number of your PIIVault Container.\n  |\n|\n Account ID\n  |\n Enter your PIIVault Service Account ID.\n  |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter API Key for your PIIVault service.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new\n\nAnonomatic Augmented\n\nWriteback DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |  |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n\nEnter the ID of your Domo dataset containing PII data to anonymize with PIIVault Anonomatic service.\n\nYou can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\n\n\n For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n|\n Map dataset PII fields and Anonomatic service fields\n  | * Select the dataset column for the required Anonomatic service field. Choose a field that should be\n\nunique.\n* Match the desired Anonomatic service fields and dataset's PII data columns for optional fields.\n* Use 'Redact Value' checkbox if you want to redact any PII field data from Domo.\n |\n|\n Identifier FieldName\n  |\n Enter the input dataset id to map the fields here.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the host name and port number of your PIIVault Container, and the account ID and API key associated with your PIIVault Service.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n###\n How do I find the Input Dataset ID?\n\nYour Domo input dataset id is in the URL of the dataset you are exporting data from. For example:\n\nhttps://customer.domo.com/datasources/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee/details/settings\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4408834497431\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003987\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAnonomatic Augmented Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,392\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "anonomatic_augmented_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
