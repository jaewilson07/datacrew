When you request to add a filter for a column in your DataSet, Domo automatically determines the data type for that column and provides logical filter options. For example, if you choose to filter a column containing numerical values, the dialog provides \"greater than,\" \"less than,\" and \"between\" options; and if you choose to filter a column with multiple series, the dialog lets you pick one or more series to narrow down to. You can also filter dates using various date filtering criteria.\n                       \n\n                        Applying Quick Filters\n                       \n\n                        Quick Filters are pre-defined filters you can use to create a self-guided experience for others to explore data on a Card and answer questions for themselves. When you apply a Quick Filter to a column on a Card, a new pane is added to the Card containing quick filter checkboxes for those columns. Any user who opens the Details view for this Card can then show or hide columns\u00a0quickly and easily just by selecting\u00a0those columns in the Quick Filter pane.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Adding Quick Filters in Analyzer\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - Searching in Quick Filters\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         To add Quick Filters to a Card,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Open the Analyzer for the Card you want to add Quick Filters to.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Drag the column you want to provide filters for into the\n                          \n                           Filters\n                          \n                          pane.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Turn on the\n                          \n                           Display as Quick Filter\n                          \n                          option.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For example, let's say Betty Symington, the creator of the \"Shipping Costs per State\" Card,\u00a0wants to provide users with a quick filter for toggling states in the Card. In the Analyzer for the Card, she drags the \"Customer State\" column\u00a0into the\n                        \n                         Filters\n                        \n                        pane then turns on\n                        \n                         Display as Quick Filter\n                        \n                        , as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        This adds a \"Customer State\" Quick Filter to the chart, as shown here:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Betty then saves the Card. The \"Customer State\" Quick Filter is now a permanent addition to the Card until someone removes it in the Analyzer.\n                       \n\n                        Let's next say that user Brad Storch, manager of the Southeast\u00a0region for the company,\u00a0opens the Details view for the Card. Brad only wants to compare\u00a0data for the three states in his region\u2014the data for all other states is unimportant to him and only clutters the graph. So he first checks and then unchecks the\n                        \n                         Select All\n                        \n                        box to clear all checkboxes.\u00a0Then he checks the boxes for Florida, Georgia, and Alabama\u00a0to compare data for those states.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note:\n                            \n                            Currently, Analyzer supports up to 20 quick filters on a Card. Adding more will not allow you to save the Card.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Filter types for Quick Filters\n                       \n\n                        You can add Quick Filters for any of the three data types in Domo\u2014string/text, values, and dates. You can have as many Quick Filters for a Card as you want. In the previous example, Betty could also add Quick Filters for the product categories as well as the actual shipping costs. Brad could then apply filters for these facets as well.\n                       \n\n                        When you add Quick Filters for string data, you can choose how users select the desired filters. You do this by clicking on the gear menu at the top of the Quick Filter and choosing\n                        \n                         Match values\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Multi select\n                        \n                        , or\n                        \n                         Single select\n                        \n                        . With\n                        \n                         Match values\n                        \n                        , users locate the filters they want using search filters\u00a0such as\n                        \n                         contains\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         starts with\n                        \n                        , etc. With\n                        \n                         Multi select\n                        \n                        , users check boxes for columns they want to show (as shown in the previous example). They can check the\n                        \n                         Select All\n                        \n                        box to select the boxes for all columns or select this box a second time to clear all the checkboxes. Note that clearing all checkboxes doesn't cause the graph to appear blank; all columns are still shown. Filtering does not occur until you select specific checkboxes. With\n                        \n                         Single select\n                        \n                        , users select a single filter by clicking radio buttons. The\n                        \n                         Multi select\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         Single select\n                        \n                        options both include standard search bar so you can narrow down the available filters.\n                       \n\n                        When you add Quick Filters for date data, users can select\u00a0from a number of conditional options such as \"is greater than,\" \"is between,\" etc., as well as use a date picker to choose the date(s) they want to filter on.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        When you add Quick Filters for value data, users can select from a number of conditional options such as \"is greater than,\" \"is between,\" etc., as well as enter the specific value(s) they want to filter on. A slider is provided that shows the minimum and maximum values in the column and lets you select any number between these.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        You can hide any Quick Filter by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to it.\n                       \n\n                        If you have multiple Quick Filters, you can rearrange them the way you want. You do this by clicking the\n                        \n                         Reorder\n                        \n                        link at the top of the Quick Filters pane then clicking\u00a0the handles (the three-line icons) and dragging the bars to where you want. You can also rename your Quick Filters in this view by clicking on the current name and entering the desired new name.\n                       \n\n                        You can also now add Aggregated Filters as a Quick Filter.

Not only does this make it possible to glean the most valuable data from a lengthy report, but you can also create multiple charts from a single DataSet by applying different filters to that DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        This section discusses applying filters to Visualization Cards.

For example, if you applied a filter to the \"Profit\" column, it would apply to each cell in that column, not to the summed data as shown in the chart.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          It is possible to filter on\u00a0NULL\u00a0values, but to do so you must use Beast Mode to convert the\u00a0NULL\u00a0values into values that can be filtered. For example:\n                          \n\n\n                           CASE WHEN `column` IS NULL then 'Filter' ELSE 'Do not Filter' END\n                          \n\n\n                          For more information about Beast Mode, see\n                          \n                           Adding a Beast Mode Calculation to Your Chart\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Page filters may be applied to a Card when viewing the Card in the\u00a0Details\u00a0view or when drilling to the Card from the\u00a0Details\u00a0view.

For example, if your DataSet contains seven months of data, the timeline would automatically be broken down into months, even if data items appeared for individual days in your DataSet. If you manually change the date grain, the timeline shows dates as they appear in your DataSet.

When selected, date data appears as it does in your DataSet, using individual dates and applying the\n                               \n                                Date Output Format\n                               \n                               setting.\n                               \n                               For more information, see\n                               \n                                Chart Properties\n                               \n                               .\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               By default, when a chart uses a weekly date grain, weeks are represented with week numbers, e.g. \"Week 4\" for the fourth week of the year. If you want, you can change this so weeks are shown with specific dates instead.

This is to ensure optimal performance in Card rendering. You can see all years that exist in your data if it is set to\n                               \n                                Graph by None\n                               \n                               .\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Limiting date data in a chart\n                       \n\n                        In addition to selecting the date range for your chart and choosing the date grain, you can filter\u00a0the data that appears\u00a0within the selected date range. You do this in the\n                        \n                         Date Filter\n                        \n                        sub-menu. You can\u00a0filter date data using any of a number of conditional statements, such as \"is greater than,\"\u00a0\"is less than or equal to,\" \"is between,\" etc. For example, if you only wanted your chart to show data for August 12th, 2014 and later, you would select\n                        \n                         is greater than or equal to\n                        \n                        , then select\u00a0August 12th, 2014 in the calendar.\n                       \n\n                        When you set a filter\u00a0for date data in this way,\u00a0the filter appears in your\n                        \n                         Filters\n                        \n                        pane.\u00a0If desired, you can quickly remove the filter by\u00a0mousing over it and clicking the \"x\" that appears.
