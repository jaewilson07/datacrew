Due to Excel's nature as an extremely extensible product, there are nearly endless combinations of formatting and configurations that you can use in order to make your data actionable. With the new File Upload connector, you can maintain all of the organization and configuration of your custom Excel or CSV files and still have usable data within Domo. Requiring virtually no input, the Excel/CSV Upload Wizard does the heavy lifting for you when you need to leverage the power of your Excel or CSV data in Domo.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nFile Upload Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Domo Skills\n\nDomo\u00a0Skills empowers new Freemium users to understand the fundamentals of Domo. To set these users up for success, they are walked through a series of skills that have been shown to be critical tasks in determining Domo's value to the customer. They learn how to connect data, create cards, and organize dashboards through a series of guided challenges. A progress bar encourages them through this journey toward success in Domo.\n\n\n The Domo Skills feature is presented after sign-up to new English language Freemium customers.\n\n\n###\n SAML RelayState Redirect Option\n\nWe have shipped a fix to SSO\u00a0that enables loading of multiple cards on the same page using Domo Everywhere: Domo Embed. To allow this, we have repurposed the SAML \"RelayState\" tag. You can enable\u00a0this\u00a0behavior by checking the\n **Use SAML RelayState to redirect**\n checkbox in\n **Admin > Security Settings > Single Sign-On (SSO)**\n .\u00a0Any customers who have built a custom SAML solution to support Domo embed will likely want to make use of this feature. If this feature doesn't work with your setup, there is fallback logic to continue using the previous method for redirects.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nUnderstanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On\n\n.\n\n\n Getting Help\n--------------\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by clicking\n\n*> Help Center**\n .\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://university.domo.com\n* search for training apps in the Appstore\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\nhttps://dojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support by entering a help ticket in the Domo Support Portal or\u00a0by sending a Buzz message to\n\n\\support.\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo (\n\n*> Feedback**\n ).
