Due to Excel's nature as an extremely extensible product, there are nearly endless combinations of formatting and configurations that you can use in order to make your data actionable. With the new File Upload connector, you can maintain all of the organization and configuration of your custom Excel or CSV files and still have usable data within Domo. Requiring virtually no input, the Excel/CSV Upload Wizard does the heavy lifting for you when you need to leverage the power of your Excel or CSV data in Domo.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         File Upload Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Domo Skills\n                       \n\n                        Domo\u00a0Skills empowers new Freemium users to understand the fundamentals of Domo. To set these users up for success, they are walked through a series of skills that have been shown to be critical tasks in determining Domo's value to the customer. They learn how to connect data, create cards, and organize dashboards through a series of guided challenges. A progress bar encourages them through this journey toward success in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        The Domo Skills feature is presented after sign-up to new English language Freemium customers.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        SAML RelayState Redirect Option\n                       \n\n                        We have shipped a fix to SSO\u00a0that enables loading of multiple cards on the same page using Domo Everywhere: Domo Embed.
