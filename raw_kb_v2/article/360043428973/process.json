When you add them\u00a0to a Card Page in Domo, users visiting that Page can click on one or more values to filter the other Cards in the Page. For example, you could build a Slicer Card with names of U.S. states and add it to a Card Page. If you then clicked \"Texas\" and \"Oklahoma,\" all of the Cards in the Page would be filtered to show only data for those states.\n\n\n For more information about creating Slicer Cards, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Checkbox Card\n\n|\n Checkbox Cards are almost exactly the same as Slicer Cards (see above) but use checkboxes instead of buttons for filtering. As with Slicer Cards, you can filter on multiple values when you use Checkbox Cards.\n\n\n For more information about creating Slicer Cards, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n  |  |\n|\n Radio Button Card\n\n|\n Radio Button Cards are similar to Slicer and Checkbox Cards (see above). The key difference is that while Slicer and Checkbox Cards allow you to set multiple filters at once, with Radio Button Cards only one filter may be set at a time.\n\n\n For more information about creating Slicer Cards, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n  |  |\n|\n Range Card\n\n|\n Range Cards display a slider with a minimum and maximum value. When you add a range Card to a Card Page in Domo, users visiting that Page can use the slider buttons to narrow the range between the minimum and maximum values.\u00a0All other Cards in the Page then filter to show the data for the newly selected range.\n\n\n For more information about creating Range Cards, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n  |  |\n|\n Date Selector Card\n\n|\n Date Selector\u00a0Cards display a calendar-style range of dates. When you add them\u00a0to a Card Page in Domo, users visiting that Page can select a range of dates from the calendar as a filter. Alternatively, they can choose from a number of preset date filters such as \"Last year,\" \"Last 2 months,\" etc. The date filter you choose is applied to all other Cards on the Page. For example, if you selected all dates from April 1st to July 31st on the calendar, all other Cards in the Page would be filtered to show just the data for these dates.\n\n\n For more information about creating Date Selector Cards, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Dropdown Selector Card\n\n\n |\n Dropdown Selector Cards display values from a selected DataSet column. When you add them to a Dashboard in Domo, users visiting that Dashboard can click on values to filter the other Cards on the Dashboard. You can set up the Dropdown Selector Card to filter on a single value or multiple values at once.\n\n\n For more information about creating Dropdown Selector Cards, see\n\nApplying Page-Level Filters\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043428973\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004729\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAvailable Filter Charts\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,350\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:26 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "available_filter_charts", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
