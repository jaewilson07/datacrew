HTML Tables can be based on either columns or rows, but not both. This means you have to use a large amount of space to display information.\n                       \n\n                        Pivot Tables, on the other hand, allow you to display data using both rows and columns. Each cell in the table contains data for the intersecting column and row. You can also have\u00a0multiple columns and/or rows. Each subsequent column or row you add becomes a new grouping within the previously added grouping.\n                       \n\n                        This article describes how to manage Pivot Tables in Domo in the following categories:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Pivot Table capabilities\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Power Pivot Tables\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Customize\u00a0Pivot Tables\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Best practices for Pivot Tables\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Pivot Table Capabilities\n                       \n\n                        Pivot Tables provide the following capabilities:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Alert integration\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Beast Mode support\n                         \n\n\n                         Card-to-Card Filter support\n                        \n\n\n                          Color rules\n                         \n\n\n                         Color/attribute control by row and column\n                        \n\n\n                          Connect and update data\n                         \n                         , as with any other chart type\n                        \n\n\n                          Drill Path\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Domo Embed support\n                         \n\n\n                         Expand/collapse rows and columns\n                        \n\n                         Export to\n                         \n                          Excel and CSV\n                         \n                         or\n                         \n                          PowerPoint\n                         \n\n\n                         Full integration with Analyzer\n                        \n\n                         Full mobile support\n                        \n\n                         Highlighting and selection by row and column grouping\n                        \n\n                         Independent control over row and column totals\n                        \n\n                         Much larger table handling\n                        \n\n                         Quick Filters support\n                        \n\n\n                          Share via email\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Summary Numbers\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Pivot Tables have Table Calculation functionality.

It contains two row groupings, \"Product Category\" and \"Product Sub-Category,\" and two column groupings, \"Region\" and \"Customer State.\" Each product category is broken down into subcategories, and each region is broken down by state.\u00a0For example, \"Furniture\" contains individual rows for \"Bookcases\" and \"Office Furniture,\" and \"Central\" contains individual columns for \"Illinois\" and \"Michigan.\"\n                       \n\n                        In addition, two columns of data are displayed: \"Profit\" and \"Sales.\" These columns allow you to efficiently find the profit and sales values for the combination of any product and geographic location.\u00a0For example, if you are asked to find the profit of office furnishings for the state of Michigan, simply find the cell at the intersection of \"Office Furnishings\" and \"Michigan\"/\"Profit,\" which is $4,784.35.\n                       \n\n                        You can also find the totals for each column at the bottom of the table and individual columns for \"Profit\" total and \"Sales\" total on the right side of the table (not shown).\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Use Case #2\n                       \n\n\n                         In this example, a sales manager uses a Pivot Table to show the profits earned for all product categories. The sales manager wants to display the product categories in the rows, so they:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          drag\u00a0the \"Product Category\" column from the\n                         \n\n\n                           Dimensions\n                          \n\n\n                          pane into\n                         \n\n                          Rows\n                         \n\n                          above the chart preview.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          drag the \"Profit\" column from the\n                         \n\n                          Measures\n                         \n\n                          pane into\n                         \n\n                          Values\n                         \n\n                          above the chart\u00a0preview.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         This generates a basic Pivot Table that displays the profits for the three categories and their grand total, as shown below.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        At this point, the table does not provide much useful information, so the sales manager decides to expand the table to include data for regions. They drag the \"Region\" column into\n                        \n                         Columns\n                        \n                        above the chart preview. This adds a \"Region\" header row at the top of the table, adds a \"Profit \" column to the right side of the table, and divides the table into four \"Profit\" columns, one for each region.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        This is a little more helpful, but still lacks specifics. The table says that all the furniture generated a total profit of $152,374.80, but we don't know the breakdown of the furniture types and how they contribute to this total.\n                       \n\n                        The sales manager realizes this, so they decide to add another column, \"Product Sub-Category,\" to the table. They do this by dragging the \"Product Sub-Category\" column into\n                        \n                         Rows\n                        \n                        above the chart preview, just as they did with \"Product Category.\" This divides each product category into subcategories, and each subcategory now displays individual profit values.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           You do not need to include columns or rows in their logical breakdown order like in the previous example. If the sales manager switches the order of \"Product Category\" and \"Product Sub-Category,\" the data will still display correctly.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        However, instead of the subcategories displaying in their own easy-to-read groupings, as shown above, each will be listed in alphabetical order and paired with its parent category, as shown below. Because this is harder to read, we recommend that you always arrange the columns in a field in their logical breakdown order.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        The sales manager completes their Pivot Table by adding two more columns. They drag \"Customer State\" into\n                        \n                         Columns\n                        \n                        and \"Sales\" into\n                        \n                         Values\n                        \n                        . This divides the regions into individual states (similar to what the sales manager did with \"Product Category\" and \"Product Sub-Category\") and adds a new data column, \"Sales,\" for each state.\n                        \n\n\n\n                        At this point, the sales manager can make various adjustments to the Pivot Table to make it more readable and useful to viewers. They could set color rules to draw attention to values in a certain range, change the sort and aggregation type for certain columns, highlight total and subtotal rows and columns, add a Drill Path, and much more.
