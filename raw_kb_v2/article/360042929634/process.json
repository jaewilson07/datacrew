You can also add an optional query expression to filter resources.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Resources\n  |\n Select the Oracle CRM On Demand resource (record) you want to pull into Domo as a DataSet.\n\n\n |\n|\n Attributes\n  |\n Select all the attributes (columns) of the selected resource you want to appear in your DataSet.\n  |\n|\n Advanced Options\n  |\n Check this box to reveal the optional\n **Query Expression**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Query Expression (Optional)\n  |\n Enter a query expression to filter resources in a collection.
