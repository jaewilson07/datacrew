.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Oracle CRM On Demand account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The user host where your Oracle CRM On Demand account is located
* Your Oracle CRM On Demand username and password

 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 Resources
  |
 Select the Oracle CRM On Demand resource (record) you want to pull into Domo as a DataSet.


 |
|
 Attributes
  |
 Select all the attributes (columns) of the selected resource you want to appear in your DataSet.
  |

 Advanced Options
  |
 Check this box to reveal the optional
 **Query Expression**
 field.
  |
|
 Query Expression (Optional)
  |
 Enter a query expression to filter resources in a collection. A query expression is comprised of one or more "field expressions." The maximum supported query expression length is 4096 characters.


 The following is the query expression syntax:


`QUERY EXPRESSION = FIELD EXPRESSION [; FIELD EXPRESSION]


 [FIELD EXPRESSION] = <Field> <OPERATOR> <VALUE> [ANDOR CLAUSE]


 [ANDOR CLAUSE] = <AND/OR> <OPERATOR> <VALUE> [ ANDOR CLAUSE]`


 The following example shows a query expression with two field expressions separated by a semicolon:


`AccountName='PSKDemo02' OR = 'A. C. Networks'; Reference = false`


**Tips:**


* Use single quotes around values.
* Use the same date format as exists in the field you are writing the expression for.
