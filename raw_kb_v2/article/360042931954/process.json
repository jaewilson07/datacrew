Additionally, the DataSet via Email Connector can parse through a Gzip or Zip file to return a .csv or .xlsx file. When you configure this connector, it generates a unique email address that corresponds to your Dataset via Email DataSet in Domo. Once the email address is created, you can send the spreadsheet as an attachment to that email address. The connector will then process the email and update your data accordingly.\n                        \n\n                         Please note that this connector currently pulls in data from only one attachment. If your email message includes more than one attachment, data is pulled from the first listed attachment.\n                        \n\n\n                        Note that each time you configure this connector, you do so for an attachment with a fixed set of characteristics. For instance, if you create a configuration for CSV files with specific parameters, you cannot then send XLS spreadsheets to the email address that is generated unless you go back into the connector interface and switch the file type to XLS. If you want to change the attachment file type, it is highly recommended that you create a new connection with its own email address.\n                       \n\n                        You configure settings for your DataSet via Email connection in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DataSet via Email connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n                        \n                         Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note:\n                            \n\n                           The maximum size of emails you can pull into Domo is 25 MB.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Video - DataSet Via Email Connector\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        None.
