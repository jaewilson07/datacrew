Intro
-------

Base CRM provides a web-based all-in-one sales platform that features tools for email, phone dialing, pipeline management, forecasting, and reporting. Use Domo's Base CRM connector to retrieve data gathered by Base CRM, including lists of contacts, deals, leads, orders, notes, and so on. To learn more about the Base CRM API, visit their page (

https://developers.getbase.com/

).


 You connect to your Base CRM account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Base CRM connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Base CRM account and create a DataSet, you must have a Base CRM username and password.


 Connecting to Your Base CRM Account
-------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Base CRM Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Base CRM connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Base CRM accounts in Domo) to open the Base CRM OAuth screen where you can enter your Base CRM credentials. Once you have entered valid Base CRM credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Base CRM DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Base CRM when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Base CRM.
