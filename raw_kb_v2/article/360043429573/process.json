You can drag and drop column fields to rearrange them as needed.\n                       \n\n                        The following table shows the relationship between field order and table column order:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Columns retain their unique data types even after\u00a0you drop them into a field.\u00a0As with other chart types, you can select a column in the\n                        \n                         Columns\n                        \n                        region to access additional options, such as aggregation, formatting, and so on.

Why is there a difference?\n                       \n\n                        This is most likely due to the formatting of certain columns. If you have an aggregated column, every other non-aggregated column must have a \"Group by\" applied to it to get the correct result. If there are duplicate rows, they are omitted because of the grouping. However, the summary number does not take these groupings into account, which is why the number is different.\n                       \n\n                        To align the values, you must separate\u00a0the aggregated columns OR aggregate the column in the table that is the same column from which the summary number is derived.\n                       \n\n\n                         What is the maximum number of columns I can add to my table?\n                        \n\n\n                        The maximum number of columns you can add to a Table Card is 100.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360043429573", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
