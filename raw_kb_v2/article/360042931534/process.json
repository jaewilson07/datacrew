This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Raiser's Edge connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Raiser's Edge account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A Raiser's Edge client ID for your OAuth app\n* A Raiser's Edge client secret for your OAuth app\n* A Raiser's Edge API subscription key\n* Your Raiser's Edge account credentials\n\nConnecting to Your Raiser's Edge Account\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Raiser's Edge Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Raiser's Edge account.
