The sizes of the rectangles reflect the relative values of each category.\n                       \n\n                        Powering Tree Maps\n                       \n\n                        Tree Maps require two data columns or rows from your data source. One of these contains category data, and the other contains the values for each category. You may also add optional series data (up to six additional categories) to create a Nested Tree Map. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        . A value column can also be used to determine the color values used in the chart.\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Tree Map. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n                        \n                         Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n                        \n                         Visualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        The following graphic shows you how data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a Tree Map:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Customizing Tree Maps\n                       \n\n                        You can customize the appearance of a Tree Map by editing its\n                        \n                         Chart Properties\n                        \n                        .
