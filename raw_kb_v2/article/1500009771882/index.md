Apple Search Ads allows larger advertisers or agencies to create and manage many campaigns programmatically and to run reports for customer insights and trends. The Apple Search Ads OAuth connector allows to pull the data about the performance metrics for your campaigns and ad groups from your Apple Search Ads system into Domo. Use Domo's Apple Seach Ads OAuth connector to combine your Apple Search Ads data with the data from other systems securely for more insights than ever. To learn more about the Apple Search Ads API, visit their page (

 You connect to your Apple Search Ads OAuth account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Apple Search Ads OAuth connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
