The Apple Search Ads OAuth connector allows to pull the data about the performance metrics for your campaigns and ad groups from your Apple Search Ads system into Domo. Use Domo's\u00a0Apple Seach Ads OAuth connector to combine your Apple Search Ads data with the data from other systems securely for more insights than ever. To learn more about the Apple Search Ads API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://searchads.apple.com/advanced...gn-management/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Apple Search Ads OAuth account in the Data Center.
