Combining a data warehouse with ETL tools, a collaboration platform, high-end visualizations, and the efficiency of a cloud platform, all available from any device at any time, makes Domo the ultimate tool for any level of business. Now, Domo is letting you take the content you've built and distribute it to your own customers or partners.\n                        \n\n                        Often, our customers wish to share insights with their own customer base or partners. Domo's Embedded Analytics feature now provides that capability by generating a piece of code that can be used in websites, customer portals, or any application. A secure connection through SSO providers ensures that content is delivered only to permitted end-users.\n                        \n\n                        Domo's embedded analytics are fully functioning Domo cards that live outside of the Domo platform. Users can enjoy features that let them explore the data in a card, including drill capabilities, filters, PDP (so users only see the data that applies to them), and the ability to easily change the visualizations and focus interactions.\n                        \n\n                        Welcome to the next evolution of Domo!
