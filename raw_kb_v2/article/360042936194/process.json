Combining a data warehouse with ETL tools, a collaboration platform, high-end visualizations, and the efficiency of a cloud platform, all available from any device at any time, makes Domo the ultimate tool for any level of business. Now, Domo is letting you take the content you've built and distribute it to your own customers or partners.\n\n\n Often, our customers wish to share insights with their own customer base or partners. Domo's Embedded Analytics feature now provides that capability by generating a piece of code that can be used in websites, customer portals, or any application. A secure connection through SSO providers ensures that content is delivered only to permitted end-users.\n\n\n Domo's embedded analytics are fully functioning Domo cards that live outside of the Domo platform. Users can enjoy features that let them explore the data in a card, including drill capabilities, filters, PDP (so users only see the data that applies to them), and the ability to easily change the visualizations and focus interactions.\n\n\n Welcome to the next evolution of Domo! The product you love is now available to anyone you wish to share it with, fully managed by you.\n\nFor detailed information about this feature, including step-by-step instructions for embedding cards as well as conditions for use, see\n\nSharing Cards Outside of Domo\n\n.\n\n##\n Advanced Notebook Card\n\nWith the revamped notebook card, Domo enables all types of users to create notes and presentations with style. The new version of the notebook card includes the following features:\n\n Card locking while editing\u2014only one person can edit any given card at a time, preventing changes from being overwritten.\n* Ability to add hyperlinks.\n* Ability to add images from your computer/network or from the Internet.\n* Ability to add tables.\n* Ability to pick between three font sizes.\n* Ability to change the font color and style.\n* Ability to add nested lists.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nAdding a Notebook Card\n\n.\n\n##\n New Self-Service Connectors\n\nThis month we have polished and released another 21\u00a0connectors that are now available to all customers in their Domo account.

Domo SDKs eliminate extra layers of work needed to create and maintain the authentication connection to the API Gateway. These SDKs allow developers to create custom integrations much faster and easier without needing to manage the underlying communications infrastructure.\n\n\n Additionally, these libraries have been made open-source to accelerate the time it takes for developers to leverage Domo\u2019s public endpoints and enables them to adapt and tailor each SDK to meet their specific needs.\n\n\n Take a test drive today by visiting Domo\u2019s\n\nGithub repository\n\nor reviewing more details within our developer documentation:\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/docs/domo-sdks/sdks\n\n.
