--------------------------------

Features and enhancements in this release include the following:

##
 Domo Everywhere: Embed

Domo is a business optimization tool that is unlike anything on the market. Combining a data warehouse with ETL tools, a collaboration platform, high-end visualizations, and the efficiency of a cloud platform, all available from any device at any time, makes Domo the ultimate tool for any level of business. Now, Domo is letting you take the content you've built and distribute it to your own customers or partners.


 Often, our customers wish to share insights with their own customer base or partners. Domo's Embedded Analytics feature now provides that capability by generating a piece of code that can be used in websites, customer portals, or any application. A secure connection through SSO providers ensures that content is delivered only to permitted end-users.


 Domo's embedded analytics are fully functioning Domo cards that live outside of the Domo platform. Users can enjoy features that let them explore the data in a card, including drill capabilities, filters, PDP (so users only see the data that applies to them), and the ability to easily change the visualizations and focus interactions.


 Welcome to the next evolution of Domo! The product you love is now available to anyone you wish to share it with, fully managed by you.

For detailed information about this feature, including step-by-step instructions for embedding cards as well as conditions for use, see

###
 Java, Python, and Node SDKs

Domo now provides first-class SDKs to significantly reduce the level of effort needed to implement integrations with Domo’s set of Public APIs. Domo SDKs eliminate extra layers of work needed to create and maintain the authentication connection to the API Gateway. These SDKs allow developers to create custom integrations much faster and easier without needing to manage the underlying communications infrastructure.


 Additionally, these libraries have been made open-source to accelerate the time it takes for developers to leverage Domo’s public endpoints and enables them to adapt and tailor each SDK to meet their specific needs.

##
 Buzz Onboarding

Buzz now includes promptings and easy, fast steps to follow to find and share immediate value. Add/edit your name and profile photo to enhance your communication. Send easy, one-click invitations to your network without worrying about who can or can’t have access because of licensing restrictions or budget. N


 ew users will see unobtrusive blue dots, gently pulsating to draw attention to beneficial elements such as inviting others, creating new conversations, id


 entifying important and favorite people, and optimizing conversations with the use of data.

##
 No Friction Buzz Invite

Buzz is only as robust as the network of collaborators that exists within it—a network organically grown by users inviting users. Users now are enabled to invite anyone at anytime, either directly using email addresses or by sharing a unique URL link with anyone—again, without worrying about growth constraints. Don't hesitate to get the right people in to collaborate whenever needed—they're a simple click away.
