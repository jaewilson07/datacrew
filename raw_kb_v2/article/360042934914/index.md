Based on the user's total Domo Score, the image that appears next to the Domo Score may appear as an egg, a chick, a rooster, or a fighting rooster.

Your Domo Score is impacted by all of the following:

 The completeness of your profile.
* The number of invitations to join Domo you have sent.
* The number of Buzz messages you have sent.
* People adding your cards as Favorites.
* People "liking" your content.
* The position of people who like or subscribe to your content. For example, your CEO liking a piece of content impacts your score more than someone lower in your organization liking the same content.
* The position of people you have Buzz conversations with.
* The passage of time. For example, if you go for an extended period without engaging in a Buzz conversation, your Domo Score may drop.

The score is calculated once a day.
