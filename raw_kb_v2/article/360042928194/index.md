 FAQs
------


#####
 Why is my DataSet missing "positions"?

Depending on the filters you select, you may be unintentionally excluding positions. For example, if you use "due date" as your date filter, but your position does not have a "due date" assigned, the position will never be returned, no matter what range you select in the date selector. You must also specifically request that archived and draft positions be returned using the available checkboxes in the UI.

####
 How do the filters work for the "Evaluations" and "Questions" reports?

You may find these filters a bit confusing because you aren't actually filtering the evaluations or questions. In this case, Domo requests positions for the criteria you select and we return the evaluations or questions that apply to each position that matches the filter criteria.
