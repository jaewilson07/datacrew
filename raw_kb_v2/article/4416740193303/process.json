It provides a reliable and efficient way to scale your financial transactions.\n\n\n Use the MYOB Connector to get your financial transactions and budget details in no time, and manage your future plans accordingly. This Connector provides a secure visibility into your organization's accounts and payments details. By combining your MYOB data with Domo, you\u2019ll develop a comprehensive understanding of your financial activities to fully optimize your budget and monetary transactions. To learn more about the MYOB API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.myob.com/\n\n).\n\n\n The MYOB Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud.

General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your MYOB account and create a DataSet, you must have the the client ID and client secret associated with your MYOB account.\n\n\n Your client ID and client secret is registered at\n\nhttps://my.myob.com.au/au/bd/DevAppList.aspx\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your MYOB Account\n---------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the MYOB Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your MYOB\u00a0account.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4416740193303\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003194\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMYOB Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,644\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "myob_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
