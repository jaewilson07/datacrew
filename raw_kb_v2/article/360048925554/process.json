You will be provided a username, password, and billing account ID. You will also need a client ID and secret key from Verizon\u2019s developer page.\n                         \n\n                           Reference: ThingSpace Critical Asset Sensor Pilot - Streaming Quick Start Guide - v1.3\n                          \n\n\n\n                         In addition to the Verizon ThingSpace account and developer credentials, you will need an AWS account with admin permissions to install AWS CloudFormation templates. If you do not have these permissions, you can pass these instructions to your DevOps or IT Administration team to create the AWS CloudFormation templates, or to grant permissions to your AWS user.\n                        \n\n\n                        AWS CloudFormation\n                       \n\n                        Domo has developed an AWS CloudFormation template to make deploying a complex IoT pipeline as simple as possible. This diagram describes the architecture in further detail:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        On the Edge, Critical Asset Sensors publish data on regular intervals into Verizon ThingSpace, which updates an AWS Thing Device Shadow document. The IoT Device Shadow Document data is selected with an IoT Rule. One rule will select from all device shadows, that have the name format ts_123456789012345, which is ts_ plus the IMEI of the device on the Edge. ThingSpace creates these device shadow documents, so no special naming is required. In addition, the pipeline will automatically scale to select any new devices in your fleet. Once they are added to your Verizon billing account and the devices are charged and turned on, Verizon will create shadows for the new devices and begin pushing data to AWS. The rule was designed to automatically select data from the new devices and ingest their data without any action from the administrator. After the data is selected by the IoT Rule, it is forwarded to an IoT Analytics Channel. This channel collects all the events from the Rule and funnels them into the data pipeline. The IoT Analytics Pipeline selects all the data attributes and normalizes the data for ingestion into the data lake. The data then passes into the IoT Analytics DataStore, where it is stored for DataSet creation. A dataset is created on a regular chron schedule of 15 minutes to ingest the IoT data in the DataStore.\n                       \n\n                        In Domo, an AWS IoT Analytics connector is created to ingest the normalized data into Domo. On a regular interval, data will be ingested into Domo. You can use Domo\u2019s powerful ETL tools to join the data with other data sources. You can create cards and visualizations that can give more insight into your IoT data. Using these cards and dashboards, you can then create alerts to get notification when values stray out of acceptable tolerances. Using Domo Buzz, your people can connect with each other and data to have meaningful conversations about the data.\n                       \n\n                        Deploying the AWS CloudFormation Template\n                       \n\n\n                         Sign into the AWS Console. Assume a role if required by your organization\u2019s policies. Currently the pipeline only supports regions that support AWS IoT Analytics:\n                         \n\n                           US East (Ohio)\n                          \n\n                           US East (N.
