A Progress Bar gauge is similar to a thermometer that \"fills in\" to show how close the current value is to the goal. This gauge type does not include ranges. This gauge type is similar to a\n                        \n                         Filled gauge\n                        \n                        , which also \"fills in\" to show the proximity of the current value to the target\u2014the difference is that a Progress Bar gauge shows the value as a percentage, whereas a Filled gauge shows the actual value.\n                       \n\n                        Other gauge types in Domo include\n                        \n                         Comparative Fill gauges\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Powering Progress Bar gauges\n                       \n\n                        A Progress Bar gauge requires three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one contains the current value of the gauge, one contains the maximum value, and the other contains the label that appears above the gauge. If multiple rows are present, only the data from the first row is used; all the others are ignored. If the first category contains more than one series, the series are aggregated to yield a single value for the gauge. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the maximum value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for \"Team A\" that both had a maximum value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new maximum value of 200.
