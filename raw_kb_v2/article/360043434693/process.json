To learn more about the Twitter API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Twitter account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Twitter Direct Messages connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Twitter account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Twitter username of the email address you use to log into Twitter\n* Your Twitter password\n\nConnecting to Your Twitter Direct Messages Account\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Twitter Direct Messages Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Twitter Direct Messages connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Twitter Direct Messages accounts in Domo) to open the Twitter OAuth screen where you can enter your Twitter credentials. Once you have entered valid Twitter credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Twitter Direct Messages DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Twitter when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Twitter.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a\n **Reports**\n menu from which you can select one of two Twitter Direct Messages reports.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Twitter Direct Messages report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Direct Messages\n  |\n Returns the 20 most recent direct messages sent to the authenticating user.\n  |\n|\n Direct Messages Sent\n  |\n Returns the 20 most recent direct messages sent by the authenticating user.\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434693\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003451\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nTwitter Direct Messages Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,636\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "twitter_direct_messages_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
