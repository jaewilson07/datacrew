Domo has created new reports to replace the deprecated endpoints.\n\n\n**What does this mean for you?**\n\n\n* You will need to create a new DataSet with the updated report.\n* You will then need to reach out to Domo Support and ask them to migrate your current DataSet to your new DataSet.\n\n\n Simpli.fi\n\nis a comprehensive RTB platform built for localized campaigns. To learn more about the\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nAPI, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.simpli.fi/platform/custom-api/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nSimpli.fi\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nconnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\n\nSimpli.fi\n\naccount and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nuser key\n\nThese credentials are provided on account creation. For more information, contact your\n\nSimpli.fi\n\naccount representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nAccount\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nSimpli.fi\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n User Key\n  |\n Enter your\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nuser key.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\n\nSimpli.fi\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\nSimpli.fi\n\nreport you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Campaign Ads\n  |\n This report returns the data for all Campaign Ads.\n  |\n|\n All Campaigns\n  |\n This report returns the data for all Campaigns.\n  |\n|\n All Campaign Stats\n  |\n This report returns the status of all Campaigns.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Ads By Organization\n  |\n This report returns the data for all Campaign Ads for the selected organization.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Ads\n  |\n This report returns the list of Campaign Ads.\n  |\n|\n Campaigns List\n  |\n This report returns a list of all Campaigns.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Stats\n  |\n This report returns the status of the Campaign.\n  |\n|\n Organizations\n  |\n This report returns the list of all the Organizations.\n  |\n|\n Report-Center\n  |\n This report helps to retrieve existing report models, create new report models, and update the report models.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Select the Company\n  |\n Select the company you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Organization Selection Criteria\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you want to retrieve report for all organizations or a specific organization.\n\n|\n|\n Organization\n  |\n\nSelect the organization.\n\n|\n|\n Client Selection Criteria\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you want to retrieve report for all clients or a specific client.\n\n|\n|\n Report Model Selection Criteria\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you want to retrieve the existing report model or create the new model.\n\n|\n|\n Campaign Selection Criteria\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you want to retrieve the campaigns only for the selected organization or include its descendants.\n\n|\n|\n Campaigns Fetch Criteria\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you want to bring the data for selected campaign Ids or for all the available campaign Ids.\n\n|\n|\n Report Model\n  |\n\nSelect the report model.\n\n|\n|\n Select the Client\n  |\n Select the client you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Template\n  |\n Select the template.\n  |\n|\n Model Name\n  |\n Enter the Report Model name.
