**Important:**

Simpli.fi

is deprecating certain endpoints on
 **January 31, 2022**
 . Domo has created new reports to replace the deprecated endpoints.


**What does this mean for you?**


* You will need to create a new DataSet with the updated report.
* You will then need to reach out to Domo Support and ask them to migrate your current DataSet to your new DataSet.
