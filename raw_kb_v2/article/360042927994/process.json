Because of this, DataSets built on an older version of the Shopify Connector will no longer work.\n\n\n**What does this mean for you?**\n\n\n* You will need to create a new DataSet using the updated Connector.\n\nShopify is an ecommerce platform that enables individuals and businesses to create online stores\n\n.\n\nTo learn more about the Shopify API, go to\n\nhttps://docs.shopify.com/api\n\n.\n\n\n This simplified version of the Shopify connector is easy to implement, having only four configurable reports.\n\n\n The Shopify connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Shopify connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for retrieving data for ecommerce sales, inventory, deliveries, and the like. It also supports blog and marketing information.\n  |\n| **Primary Metrics**  |\n Returns sales information for your ecommerce shop. You can also get metrics on the blog and marketing side of your business.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Warehouse managers\n* Ecommerce shop admins\n* Online sales\n* Owner/C-Suite\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than an hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Shopify account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The name of your shop.\n* The email address and password associated with your Shopify account.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Shopify Account\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Shopify Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains one field where you enter the name of your shop.\u00a0You can find the name of your shop by looking at your Shopify URL. For example, in the Shopify URL\n\n\n domo.shopify.com\n\n\n , the shop name would be\n\ndomo\n\n.\n\n\n In the Microsoft OAuth page, enter the username and password for your shop.\n\n\n After you have entered valid\u00a0Shopify credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Shopify\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Shop Name\n  |\n Enter the name of your shop as it appears in your Shopify URL.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains one primary menu,\n **Report**\n , and other menus that appear depending on the report you select.\n\n*Note:**\n Currently\u00a0you can enter only one search string in fields that request search strings, such as\n **Order Name**\n .\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the desired Shopify report.
