Users also have the ability to specify their own personal Landing Page. Either a Dashboard or a specific Card can be set as the Landing Page. This allows for setting Landing Pages that are relevant to their department, their team, or just that particular user.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Currently, the most recent option that has been set for a user will be the Landing Page that is displayed. For example, if an Admin has set a Landing Page for a specific user and then that user changes their Landing Page to a different one, the user's selection will override the Admin's selection.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Video -
