Users also have the ability to specify their own personal Landing Page. Either a Dashboard or a specific Card can be set as the Landing Page. This allows for setting Landing Pages that are relevant to their department, their team, or just that particular user.\n\n*Note:**\n Currently, the most recent option that has been set for a user will be the Landing Page that is displayed. For example, if an Admin has set a Landing Page for a specific user and then that user changes their Landing Page to a different one, the user's selection will override the Admin's selection.\n\n*Video - User-Specific Landing Pages**\n\n\n Setting the User-Specific Landing Page as an Admin\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an Admin, you are able to set User-Specific Landing Pages for multiple users or for a single user.\n\n\n**To set a User-Specific Landing Page for multiple users,**\n\n.
