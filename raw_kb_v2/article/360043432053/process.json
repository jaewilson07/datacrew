Use Domo's The Trade Desk connector to generate reports about ads, audiences, campaigns, and the like. To learn more about The Trade Desk's API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://api.thetradedesk.com/v3/doc\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your The Trade Desk account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the The Trade Desk connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is useful for pulling data about ads and campaigns filtered by one or more advertisers.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Marketing roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than an hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* It is best to select\n **All Advertisers**\n in the\n **Advertiser Type**\n menu instead of choosing to manually select advertisers. This way, as you add/remove advertisers, the DataSet will dynamically grab those advertisers when it runs in the future. That way you don't have to go back and edit your DataSet after you make changes.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your The Trade Desk account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password for your The Trade Desk account\n* Your The Trade Desk partner ID\n\nIf you do not know any of these credentials, please reach out to your The Trade Desk account representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your The Trade Desk Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the The Trade Desk Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Credentials Pane\n-------------------\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your The Trade Desk account.
