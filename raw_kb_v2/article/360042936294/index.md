Features and enhancements in this release include the following:

 Japanese Knowledge Base

Our Help Center/Knowledge Base site has been live in Domo for a few months, but we’ve finally gotten the entire portal translated and ready for our Japanese customers. The link to the new site will go live with this release.


###
 DataFlow kill ability

You can now cancel any DataFlow mid-run. This option is available in the DataFlow listings page or in the

menu on the DataFlow details view.

 Automatic retry for failed DataFlows

Failed DataFlows will be retried once automatically without a notification being sent. If the DataFlow fails a second time, a notification will be sent as usual.
