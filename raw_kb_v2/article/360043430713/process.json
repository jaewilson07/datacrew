You can share DataSets with users and groups so those people will\u00a0have access to view and edit the data. You\u00a0do this in the details view for the DataSet, which is located in the\u00a0Data Center.

So, for example, if an \"Admin\"-level user was set to \"Can Edit\" level for a DataSet, he or she would still have all of the same access privileges as an Owner or Co-Owner.

So, for example, if DataSet A and DataSet B were the only inputs to DataFlow C, and you shared\u00a0DataSet A and DataSet B with the members of group \"Sales Team West Region,\" all members of that group would then be able to edit DataFlow C.\n                       \n\n                        Sharing the output DataSet from a DataFlow does\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        grant access to the DataFlow.\u00a0To be able to edit the DataFlow, a user must be shared on all input and output DataSets used in the DataFlow.\n                       \n\n                        For more information about DataFlows, see\n                        \n                         DataFlow Management.\n                        \n\n\n                        PDP Impact\n                       \n\n                        In general, sharing a DataSet\u00a0with a user has no impact on PDP. The only exception is when you make someone an Owner or Co-Owner, in which case the user is automatically added to the \"all rows\" PDP policy and has access to the entire DataSet. So if you want to preserve PDP restrictions for a user, make sure to set them to Editor when sharing the DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        Sharing a DataSet\n                       \n\n                        You can share access to a DataSet\u00a0with users and/or groups in the details view for the DataSet.\n                       \n\n\n                         To\u00a0share a DataSet with one or more\u00a0users or groups,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Data\n                          \n                          in the toolbar at the top of the screen.\n                          \n                          The Data Center opens, with the\n                          \n                           Data Warehouse\n                          \n                          tab opened by default.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click the\n                          \n                          icon on the left side of the screen to open the\n                          \n                           DataSets\n                          \n                          tab.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Use the various filters and search options to locate\u00a0the DataSet you want to share.\n                          \n                          For more information about using these options, see\n                          \n                           Data Center Layout\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click the DataSet to open its details view.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select\n                          \n\n                           >\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Add People\n                          \n                          at the bottom of the dialog.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Enter the name of a user or group into the\n                          \n                           Search\n                          \n\n                           users\n                          \n                          field.\n                          \n                          The top results for your search appear automatically in a list as you enter characters and filter accordingly as you add or remove characters.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select the user or group you want to share the DataSet with in the list.\n                          \n                          The name of the user or group appears in the field.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select the desired access level for the user or group.\n                          \n                          For a table showing privileges for each level, see\n                          \n                           Access rights\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Note:\n                              \n                              The options available here depend on your own access rights for the DataSet\u00a0(unless you have an \"Admin\" security profile or a custom role with \"Manage All DataSets\" enabled, in which case you can always see all options).\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Add additional users or groups and set access for them by repeating the previous three\u00a0steps.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Remove a user or group from the field by clicking the \"x\" to the right of the name.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Write a message in the\n                          \n                           Message to include\n                          \n                          field to let the recipients know you're sharing a DataSet with them.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Share\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        The users and groups you selected now have access to the DataSet.
