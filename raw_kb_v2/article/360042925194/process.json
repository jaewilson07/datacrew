In the following example, a scale marker range has been set between the values of\u00a0225 and 1000. This in\n\n\n dicates the \"normal\" range of data. Any value that falls within this range is considered \"expected\" and should not require further scrutiny. However,\u00a0several data points\u2014one at January 5, one for January 11-13, and one at January 14\u2014fall outside this normal range of data. Using the scale marker range, you can spot such outliers and make any necessary business decisions.\n\nYou add scale marker ranges to charts in the\n **Chart Properties**\n .\n\n*Video - Dynamic Scale Markers**\n\nAvailable properties\n----------------------\n\nThe following table lists and describes all properties of scale marker ranges available in the\n **Chart Properties**\n :\n\n\n**Note:**\n Properties relating to percentiles, percentages, standard deviations, and quantiles are currently available\n *only*\n for single-series Bar charts and basic single-series and multiple-series Line charts.\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Required?\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Text\n  |\n Lets you specify\u00a0text to replace the default word \"GOAL\" that normally appears above the top left corner of the chart when a scale marker has been set. If the chart contains a legend, an item for the scale marker is added to the legend with this text (unless you hide it by checking the\n **Scale Marker > Hide in Legend**\n box).\n  |\n No\n  |\n|\n Scale\n  |\n In dual-scale charts, lets you specify whether the goal in the chart is associated with the left or\u00a0right scale.\n  |\n Yes (for dual-scale charts)\n  |\n|\n Type\n  |\n Lets you specify whether the scale marker is a line or a range of values.\n  |\n Yes\n  |\n|\n Value Type\n  |\n Lets you determine how the scale marker line is calculated.

(Quantile markers by nature are dynamic.) By default, when you select\n **Line**\n or\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu, you are asked to enter a value or values for the line or range. Scale markers based on these values are static; they will not change when the chart data changes. If you select any option other than\n **Default**\n or\n **Manual**\n in the\n **Value Type**\n menu (or\n **Upper Value Type/Lower Value**\n**Type**\n menus for a range), however, your scale markers become dynamic; they\u00a0update based on changes in your chart data. These dynamic value types are described in more detail in the following section.\n\n##\n Value types for line and range markers\n\nThis section describes all of the options available in the\n **Scale Marker >**\n**Value Type/Upper Value Type/Lower Value Type**\n menus in Chart Properties. All of the examples provided here are for line markers but apply to range markers as well.\n\n###\n Manual\n\nThis is the default setting. When you select\n **Manual**\n for your value type, you are asked to enter a static value for your marker or markers. Markers entered in this way do not change when your chart data changes.\n\n###\n Minimum\n\nWhen you select\n **Minimum**\n as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the minimum value in the chart.\n\n\n####\n Maximum\n\nWhen you select\n **Maximum**\n as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the maximum value in the chart.\n\n\n####\n Average\n\nWhen you select\n **Average**\n as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the average value in the chart.\n\n\n####\n Median\n\nWhen you select\n **Median**\n as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to the median\u00a0value in the chart.\n\n\n####\n Percentile\n\nWhen you select\n **Percentile**\n as the value type for a scale marker, the marker line corresponds to a given percentile value, which you specify in the\n **Percentile Value**\n field for a line marker and the\n **Lower Percentile Value**\n /\n **Upper Percentile Value**\n fields for a range marker. In the example below, the percentile value has been set to\n\n85\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Percentage\n\nWhen you select\n **Percentage**\n as the value type for a scale marker, you are asked to enter a percentage value (in the\n **Percentage Value**\n field for a line marker or the\n **Lower Percentage Value**\n /\n **Upper Percentage**\n**Value**\n fields for a range marker) as well as select whether the percentage is derived from the maximum (default), minimum, average, or median value of the chart (in the\n **Percentage Of**\n dropdown menu\u00a0for a line marker or the\n **Lower Percentage Of**\n /\n **Upper Percentage Of**\n\nmenus for a range marker).\n\n\n In the example below, the user entered\n\n50\n\nfor the\n **Percentage Value**\n and selected\n **Average**\n in the\n **Percentage Of**\n menu, so the chart shows the scale marker on the line corresponding to 50% of the average value of the chart.\n\n\n####\n Standard deviation\n\nWhen you select\n **Standard Deviation**\n as the value type for a scale marker, you are asked to enter the number of standard deviations from the mean\u00a0(in the\n **Standard Deviations**\n field for a line marker or the\n **Lower Standard Deviations**\n /\n **Upper Standard Deviations**\n\nfields for a range marker). If you enter a positive number, your marker appears above the mean; if you enter a negative number, your marker appears below the mean.\n\n\n In the example below, the user entered -3 in the\n **Standard Deviations**\n field, so the marker corresponds to the line 3 standard deviations below the median.\n\n\n###\n Quantile markers\n\nQuantiles divide the area between your chart's minimum and maximum values into regions of equal value, depending on the data in the chart. In the below example, the user has chosen to include 5\u00a0quantiles (quintiles). This divides the chart into 5 regions, with the 3 regions closest to average appearing shaded.\n\nAs with all of the non-default value types for line and range scale markers, quantiles are dynamic and will update when your chart data updates.\n\n\n To add a basic set of quantiles\u00a0as scale markers to your chart, you simply go into Chart Properties for your chart and select\n **Scale Marker > Type**\n**> Quantiles**\n . Then choose the desired number of quantiles\u00a0in the\n **Number of Quantiles**\n menu. There are a number of other properties you can use to customize your quantiles, all optional. To learn more about these, see\n\nAvailable Properties\n\n, above.\n\n\n Quantiles are currently available only for\n\nsingle-series bar charts and basic single-series and multiple-series line charts.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042925194\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005034\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAdding Scale Markers to Your Charts\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,932\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 11/2/2022, 9:00 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 11/2/2022, 9:04 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "adding_scale_markers_to_your_charts", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_properties", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaodGAC"}]}
