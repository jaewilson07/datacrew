In the following example, a scale marker range has been set between the values of\u00a0225 and 1000. This in\n                        \n\n                        dicates the \"normal\" range of data. Any value that falls within this range is considered \"expected\" and should not require further scrutiny. However,\u00a0several data points\u2014one at January 5, one for January 11-13, and one at January 14\u2014fall outside this normal range of data.
