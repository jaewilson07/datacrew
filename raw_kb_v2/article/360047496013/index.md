In Workbench 4's Plugin Manager you can view registered plugins, add plugins, and remove installed plugins. All Workbench plugins are contained within Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). In the Plugin Manager, you can click a DLL


 file name to show the plugins within it. These are shown by type and name. For example, in the following screenshot, the user has clicked the DLL file
 *DomoDataProviders.dll*
