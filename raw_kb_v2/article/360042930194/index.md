 DocuSign provides services for facilitating electronic exchanges of contracts and signed documents. Domo's DocuSign connector allows you to speed up transactions and cut costs by retrieving data about DocuSign entities such as users, folders, templates, and so on. To learn more about the DocuSign API, visit their website. (

https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/documentation

)

The DocuSign connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

You connect to your DocuSign account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DocuSign connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

Best Practices
----------------


* Make sure the credentials and the report configuration are valid.
* Use "Replace." If you use "Append," you may need to deduplicate using a DataFlow.
* The connector pages data back for date-driven reports. Entering the number of days back will pull that many days back but will also increase the connector runtime. Only pull the data you need. If you have data older than the days back you have entered, the connector will keep going without getting any more data before it finishes.


 Prerequisites
----------------


 To connect to your DocuSign account and create a DataSet, you must have the email address and password you use to sign in to your DocuSign account.
