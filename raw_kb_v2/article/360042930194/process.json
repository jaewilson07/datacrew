Domo's DocuSign connector allows you to speed up transactions and cut costs by retrieving data about DocuSign entities such as users, folders, templates, and so on. To learn more about the DocuSign API, visit their website. (\n\nhttps://www.docusign.com/developer-center/documentation\n\n)\n\nThe DocuSign connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your\u00a0DocuSign account\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0DocuSign connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector lets you retrieve data for DocuSign users and documents managed using DocuSign.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Signed/unsigned documents\n* Template documents\n* Rejected document signings\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Legal\n* HR\n* Sales\n* Realtors\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than an hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Make sure the credentials and the report configuration are valid.\n* Use \"Replace.\" If you use \"Append,\" you may need to deduplicate using a DataFlow.\n* The connector pages data back for date-driven reports. Entering the number of days back will pull that many days back but will also increase the connector runtime. Only pull the data you need. If you have data older than the days back you have entered, the connector will keep going without getting any more data before it finishes.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0DocuSign\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the email address and password you use to sign in to your DocuSign account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your DocuSign\u00a0Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0DocuSign\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0DocuSign account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\n*Field**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nEmail Address\n\n|\n\nEnter the email address you use to log into your DocuSign account.\n\n|\n|\n\nPassword\n\n|\n\nEnter the password you use to log into your\u00a0DocuSign account.\n\n|\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0DocuSign credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0DocuSign DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains\u00a0two primary menus in which you can select a DocuSign report and pertinent accounts.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect\u00a0a\u00a0DocuSign report.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nAccount Information\n\n|\n\nReturns information about the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nAccount Information Billing Plan\n\n|\n\nReturns billing plan information about the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nBrands Profile Information\n\n|\n\nReturns\u00a0a list of brand profiles associated with the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnvelopes\n\n|\n\nReturns envelope status changes for all envelopes in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnvelopes Audit Events\n\n|\n\nReturns\u00a0audit events for all envelopes in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnvelopes Custom Fields\n\n|\n\nReturns custom field information for all envelopes in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnvelopes Documents\n\n|\n\nReturns a list of documents associated with all envelopes in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnvelopes Notifications\n\n|\n\nReturns reminder and expiration information for all envelopes in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nEnvelopes Status\n\n|\n\nReturns the overall status for all envelopes in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nFolders\n\n|\n\nReturns a list of folders for the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nGroups\n\n|\n\nReturns a list of user groups in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nPermission Profiles\n\n|\n\nReturns a list of permission profiles for the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nTemplates\n\n|\n\nReturns the list of templates for the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nUnsupported File Types\n\n|\n\nReturns a list of file types that are not supported for uploads in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nUsers\n\n|\n\nReturn\u00a0a list of users in the selected account.\n\n|\n|\n\nUsers Information\n\n|\n\nReturns information for all users in the selected account, including name, ID, user type, email, etc.\n\n|\n\n\n |\n|\n\nAccount\n\n|\n\nSelect the DocuSign account you want to pull information for.\n\n|\n|\n\nStart Days\n\n|\n\nEnter the number of past days for which you want to pull data.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n Do I need a certain kind of account to set up this connector?\n\nAny DocuSign account can be used to set up the connector.\n\n####\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Can I use the same DocuSign account for multiple DataSets?\n\nYes.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930194\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003443\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDocuSign Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,674\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "docusign_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
