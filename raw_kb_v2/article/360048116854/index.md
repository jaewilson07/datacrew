 Managing User Licenses

Now Domo administrators can view how many users there are in Domo, how many user licenses have been purchased, and whether the number of licenses in use exceeds the allotted number of licenses. If over the license count, Domo administrators can order licenses from Domo.


 If you have an "Admin" security role, you can review your user license usage and order licenses from Domo. When you confirm a license purchase order, Domo sends an email to a Domo sales representative who sends you a purchase order invoice.


 You access the Licensing page by clicking

Admin > Licenses**
