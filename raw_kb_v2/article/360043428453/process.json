We provide an example of a client representing\u00a0the Kitchen department of a department store with 4 total departments. The client needs to know how his department compares to the other departments but wants to have the Kitchen department always stand out in the visual.\n\n\n Setup Instructions\n--------------------\n\n*To set up a 3-metric Bar chart,**\n\n. Create 3 Beast Modes as follows:\n\n\n Beast Mode Name\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Beast Mode\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n KitchenSales\n  |\n Represents the amount of sales for the Kitchen Department ONLY.\n  |\n`SUM(CASE WHEN `Department` = \u2018Kitchen\u2019 THEN `Sales` ELSE 0 END)`\n |\n|\n NonKitchenSales\n  |\n Represents the amount of sales for all NON Kitchen Departments of the store.\n  |\n`SUM(CASE WHEN `Department` = \u2018Kitchen\u2019 THEN 0 ELSE `Sales`\u00a0 END)`\n |\n|\n ShareOfDepartments\n  |\n Represents the percent of the all Sales for each individual Department.\n  |\n`(SUM(Sales) / SUM(Sales) OVER ()) * 100`\n\n* This means it shows the sum of all departments.\n\t* Multiply by 100 to show the value in percent format. |\n\n\n2. Choose the Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart as the chart type.\n\n\n Using a Stacked Bar Chart instead of a normal Bar Chart allows you to have parts of the bar represent a 0 value and other parts of the bar represent an actual value, so the series color of the bar will change based on the location of the series that you decide to use.\n3. For the Y Axis,\u00a0choose \"Department.\"\n4. For the X Axis, choose \"KitchSales\" from the BeastMode created above.\n\n\n This means that the first series of all Departments EXCEPT for the Kitchen Department will be 0.\n5. For the Series,\u00a0choose\u00a0\"NonKitchenSales\" from the BeastMode created above.\n\n\n This means that the second series of all Departments EXCEPT for the Kitchen Department will have a value, but the Kitchen Department\u2019s value of the second series will be 0.\n6. For the next Series,\u00a0choose \"ShareOfDepartments\" from the BeastMode created above.\n\n\n This value will not appear in the chart at first;\u00a0however we can access it by using data labels in a future step.\n7. For the \"ShareOfDepartments\"\u00a0series, rename the column label\u00a0to \"Share Of.\"\n8. Sort the \"Sum of Sales\" column in descending order.\n\nThis allows the chart to be ranked from highest sales to lowest regardless of Department.\n9. Configure Chart Properties as follows:\n\n* General\n\n\t+ Font Size \u2013 Larger\n\t\t+ Portrait View Legend Position \u2013 Hide\n\t\t+ Landscape View Legend Position \u2013 Hide\n\t* Data Label Settings\n\n\t+ Text -\n\n\n\t\t #%\\_CATEGORY\\_NUMBER Sales: $%\\_CATEGORY\\_TOTAL \\\\n%\\_SERIES\\_NAME: %\\_VALUE%\n\n\t\t- %\\_{{item}}\n\n\n\t\t\t represents values that can be extracted from the data in the chart. This is what allows you to see multiple metrics.\n\t\t\t- %\\_CATEGORY\\_NUMBER\n\n\n\t\t\t shows the rank position of the bar.\n\t\t\t- %\\_CATEGORY\\_TOTAL\n\n\n\t\t\t shows the total value of the bar.\n\t\t\t- %\\_SERIES\\_NAME\n\n\n\t\t\t shows the name of the last series from the label.\n\t\t\t- %\\_VALUE\n\n\n\t\t\t shows the value of the last series.\n\t\t\t- \\\\n\n\n\n\t\t\t creates a new line.\n\t\t+ Show One Label \u2013 True\n\n\t\t- This makes it so you only see the label one time rather than over and over for each series.\n\t\t+ Position \u2013 Inside Right\n\n\t\t- This allows you to choose where the label will be on the chart.\n\t\t+ Justification \u2013 Left\n\n\t\t- This allows your label text to be left-justified to give a cleaner look.\n\t\t+ Use Scale Abbreviation \u2013 True\n\n\t\t- This shortens the numeric values to give an easier-to-read label.\n\t\t+ Decimal Places - .0\n\n\t\t- This allows for each label value to only be 1 decimal out.\n\t* Value Scale (X)\n\n\t+ Label Format \u2013 Currency\n\n\t\t- This allows for the format of the label to be in Currency format.\n\t* Colors\n\n\t+ Series 1 \u2013 Light Green\n\n\t\t- This colors the bar that represents the Sales for the Kitchen Department Only.\n\t\t+ Series 2 \u2013 Light Gray\n\n\t\t- This colors the bars that represent all bars EXCEPT for the Kitchen Department.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043428453\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004746\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\n3-Metric Bar Charts\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,029\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:28 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "3metric_bar_charts", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
