You can set up Read only and return later to set up the Write portion.\n                       \n\n                        Recommended Account Creation - All\n                       \n\n                        Before setting up the Snowflake connection, we strongly recommend that you complete the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          (Recommended) \u200bCreate a Snowflake service account \u2014\n                         \n                         We recommend creating a new Snowflake account specifically for this integration. You can use any account with read access in Snowflake,\u00a0but a service account is best practice.\u00a0This account must have read\u00a0access to your default Snowflake environment in order to create virtual Snowflake tables in Domo.\n                        \n\n\n                          (Recommended) Create a Domo service account \u2014\n                         \n                         We recommend creating a new Domo account specifically for this integration. The account role must have the Manage Cloud Accounts and Manage DataSet grants enabled.\n                        \n\n\n                        For more information about roles and grants, see our article about\n                        \n                         Managing Custom Roles.\n                        \n\n\n                        Account Creation - Write\n                       \n\n                        Before registering with Cloud Amplifier for the Write portion of the setup, you must complete the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           (Required) Create a default Snowflake database \u2014\n                          \n                          You need a Snowflake database that is exclusively for Domo to write Domo-managed tables. During setup, this database is the default.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             Any tables not managed by Domo in this database will not be seen by Cloud Amplifier.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          (Conditional) Place IP Addresses on an allowlist \u2014\n                         \n                         If your Snowflake environment restricts access based on IP address, you may need to place Domo IPs on an allowlist.\n                         \n                          For more information, see our article about\n                          \n                           Allowlisting IP Addresses for Connectors and Federated Adapters\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Important:\n                             \n                             During the Write setup process, you are provided with SQL statements to create the integration. These statements must be executed against your Snowflake environment by a Snowflake administrator with the ACCOUNTADMIN role.\n                             \n                              This is a Snowflake requirement and prevents the need to\u00a0manage your Snowflake administrator credentials within Domo, which is especially important in larger organizations where your Snowflake administrator may not have Domo access. After the integration is established, you no longer need a Snowflake administrator account.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read-only Setup\n                       \n\n                        To set up Read-only access and\n                        \n                         to\n                        \n                        begin referencing Snowflake tables from within Domo using Cloud Amplifier, follow these steps:\n                       \n\n\n                         Log in to your Domo service account.\n                        \n\n                         In the navigation header, select\n                         \n                          Data\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n                         The Data Center displays.\n                        \n\n                         If you are not already there, go to the\n                         \n\n                          Data Warehouse\n                         \n                         in the side rail.\n                        \n\n                         In the warehouse area of the screen, select the molecule shown below.\n                         \n                         Selecting the molecule brings it\n                         \n\n                         into focus.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Select\n                         \n\n                          Add New Cloud\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n                         The Amplify modal displays.\n                        \n\n                         In the modal under\n                         \n                          Native integration\n                         \n                         , select\n                         \n                          Snowflake\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n                         The\n                         \n                          Cloud integrations\n                         \n                         modal displays.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         Select\n                         \n                          + Add New Integration\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         Enter the Snowflake setup information:\n                         \n\n\n\n                             Integration name\n                            \n                            \u2014\u00a0A unique name to help you identify the integration in Domo.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            (Optional)\n                            \n                             Integration description\n                            \n                            \u2014\u00a0A description of\u00a0the integration.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                             Snowflake\u00a0connection URL\n                            \n                            \u2014\u00a0This is your Snowflake URL,\n                            \n\n                            which you can find\n                            \n\n                            on the Snowflake login page.

If you connect to an existing Snowflake database, then Domo does not see the tables that are in that database.\n                       \n\n\n                         What is the guidance around warehouse configuration in Snowflake for Cloud Amplifier?\n                        \n\n\n                        Domo performs different activities within the CDW account, such as data loading and\u00a0querying. For proof of concepts\u00a0and initial testing, we recommend a small-sized multi-cluster warehouse (multi-purpose for load\u00a0and query) set to scale up automatically. You can set a limit on the\n                        \n\n                        max cluster size to put an upper bound on scaling and\u00a0limit the cost envelope.\n                       \n\n                        When you are ready for production data, we recommend setting up warehouses depending on the purpose. Using separate warehouses for querying and loading allows you to optimize performance as needed.\n                       \n\n\n                         How do I use data transformation on my Snowflake data?\n                        \n\n\n                        With your data in Snowflake, Domo supports two different mechanisms for transforming data:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           DataSet Views\n                          \n                          \u2014\u00a0DataSet Views provide\n                          \n\n                          the Views Explorer tool to create data transformations on your Snowflake DataSets. You can perform operations such as filtering, grouping/aggregation,\u00a0JOINs, UNIONs, and creating calculated columns from a graphic user interface. DataSet Views are created as virtual DataSets, with\u00a0queries sent back to the parent DataSets.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             Creating a DataSet View in Domo does not create a View (normal or materialized) in Snowflake. The View definition is stored in Domo, and the resulting query is sent to Snowflake table(s) when needed.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Magic ETL DataFlows\n                          \n                          \u2014\u00a0Magic ETL is\u00a0supported with Domo running on the customer's CDW. Using Magic ETL with Snowflake data results in data being exported from\u00a0Snowflake to\u00a0Magic ETL\u00a0in a transient state, processed, and written back to Snowflake.\u00a0Note that Domo only operates on this data in a transient fashion and does not store DataFlow outputs in Domo. (They are sent to the Snowflake warehouse.)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             Data is cached in the Magic ETL execution environment for seven days, or the two most recent data versions from that Magic ETL execution.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         What is the difference between Domo-managed and customer-managed Snowflake DataSets?\n                        \n\n\n                        When you connect Domo to your Snowflake account, Domo operates over two classes of databases and underlying tables. Tables you create and update directly through independent pipelines or ingestion mechanisms can be explored and registered in Domo, accessible in a read-only fashion. Domo can read and directly query these customer-managed databases.\n                       \n\n                        Additionally, we recommend creating a new database in Domo for Read/Write access. Domo uses this Domo-managed database to write data that comes\n                        \n\n                        in through the Domo ingestion pipeline,\u00a0such as with the thousands of connectors available to bring data into Snowflake. Domo also uses this Domo-managed database to create outputs of data transformations (DataFlow outputs).\n                       \n\n\n                         How are permission configured between Domo and Snowflake?\n                        \n\n\n                        Permissions originating in Snowflake are not programmatically passed into Domo. However, you can use Domo's native permission model, as well as personalized data permisssons (PDP) for data security to manage data access to underlying assets in Snowflake.\n                       \n\n\n                         What are the differences between using connectors to create DataSets from Snowflake and using Cloud Amplifier to create DataSets?\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Leaving data in Snowflake\n                         \n                         \u2014\u00a0Perhaps the biggest difference is that all Snowflake connectors import/duplicate data from Snowflake to Domo, while Cloud Amplifier leaves the data in Snowflake.\n                        \n\n\n                          Bulk create\n                         \n                         \u2014\u00a0Cloud Amplifier allows you to look up and bulk select up to 50 Snowflake tables to immediately create 50 unique DataSets.\u00a0To do this with connectors, you would have to configure each DataSet individually with a connector.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Troubleshooting\n                       \n\n                        If you get stuck, one of the following\u00a0troubleshooting steps may help:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Check Snowflake Service Account\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                         Log into Snowflake with the service account credentials.\n                        \n\n                         Make sure you can view the default Snowflake Database and can query tables that you expect to import.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Assign Correct Role\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Make sure that a Snowflake administrator with the ACCOUNTADMIN role is executing the SQL that Domo provided in Snowflake.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Use Correct URL\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Make sure that the Snowflake connection URL in Domo matches the Snowflake login URL.\n                       \n\n                        You can find the URL on the Snowflake login page.
