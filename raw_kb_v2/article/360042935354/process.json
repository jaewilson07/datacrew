This information should be given to everyone who will be sharing data, so that PDP policies are established and data is kept secure.\n* If your organization has DataSets that include PII, you need to set up specific PDP policies for sensitive data\u2014you don\u2019t want this shared out throughout the organization.\n* If you have built cards that you choose to share, you should potentially set up PDP policies about what information is visible, and then you\u2019ll know that once it\u2019s shared, you\u2019re comfortable with those cards going out to anyone else.\n\nFor more information about PDP, see\n\nPersonalized Data Permissions (PDP)\n\n.\n\n###\n Understanding Permissions When Onboarding\n\nWhen onboarding people to Domo, make sure you properly establish\u00a0permissions for user access and abilities.\n\n **Social users**\n can only see cards shared in Buzz, in addition to Buzz conversations.\n* **Participant users**\n have a \u201cview only\u201d access of content. They\u00a0can...\n\n+ view cards and pages,\n\t+ edit page-level filters,\n\t+ move cards and resize cards in a page,\n\t+ send or export cards,\n\t+ view cards in a page as a slideshow,\n\t+ download pages of cards to Microsoft PowerPoint,\u00a0and\n\t+ view and minimize collections of cards.\n* **Editor users**\n posses all Participant user abilities;\u00a0additionally they can...\n\n+ edit content they have access to,\n\t+ edit data they have been granted access to,\n\t+ share cards, and\n\t+ create content.\n* Editor users\n *cannot*\n change permissions status.\n* **Privileged users**\n can...\n\n+ edit and access cards,\n\t+ delete cards\n\t+ access data\n\t+ delete user accounts, and\n\t+ assign security roles (except when inviting a new user)\n* **Admin users**\n have all access rights to content and user permissions.\n\nFor more information about access rights, see\n\nSecurity Role Reference\n\n.\n\n###\n Using a Hub\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that you create an individual hub\u2014an implementation page, scratch pad, or whatever works for you\u2014to house all the content you will be sharing. If you have a central point to go to for what you want to share, then you know which cards/DataSets/pages you are sharing out and can easily access that content.\n\n###\n Using Groups\n\nUse groups to share out content in Domo. By setting up specific groups, you can easily share out the relevant data for that group and be able to monitor who has access to the content that you\u2019ve shared.\n\n\n For more information about groups, see\n\nCreating and Managing User Groups\n\n.\n\n###\n Understanding Your Users\n\nWhen sharing and organizing data, think about the type of data consumers you have and the way they want to consume the data.\u00a0For example, you may have some or all of the following:\n\n Consumers who will just be looking at data on mobile.\n* Consumers who need\u00a0to receive scheduled reports.\n* Consumers who will be building cards and creating their own dashboards.\n* Consumers who will need only one DataSet---share out one quick card to that person to build on.\n* Groups that needs to view only specific cards relevant to their divisions.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042935354\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004484\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBest Practices for Sharing Content in Domo\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,261\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "best_practices_for_sharing_content_in_domo", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "training", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamyGAC"}, {"text": "selfservice_training", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoCGAS"}, {"text": "best_practices_resources", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoXGAS"}]}
