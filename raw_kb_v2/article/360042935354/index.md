 PDP Policies and Sensitive Data


* Depending on the size of your organization, a lead admin, executive stakeholder or MajorDomo, and others as needed should determine the PDP policies for the organization. This information should be given to everyone who will be sharing data, so that PDP policies are established and data is kept secure.
* If your organization has DataSets that include PII, you need to set up specific PDP policies for sensitive data—you don’t want this shared out throughout the organization.
* If you have built cards that you choose to share, you should potentially set up PDP policies about what information is visible, and then you’ll know that once it’s shared, you’re comfortable with those cards going out to anyone else.

###
 Understanding Permissions When Onboarding

When onboarding people to Domo, make sure you properly establish permissions for user access and abilities.

 **Social users**
 can only see cards shared in Buzz, in addition to Buzz conversations.
* **Participant users**
 have a “view only” access of content. They can...

+ view cards and pages,
	+ edit page-level filters,
	+ move cards and resize cards in a page,
	+ send or export cards,
	+ view cards in a page as a slideshow,
	+ download pages of cards to Microsoft PowerPoint, and
	+ view and minimize collections of cards.
* **Editor users**
 posses all Participant user abilities; additionally they can...

+ edit content they have access to,
	+ edit data they have been granted access to,
	+ share cards, and
	+ create content.
* Editor users
 *cannot*
 change permissions status.
* **Privileged users**
 can...

+ edit and access cards,
	+ delete cards
	+ access data
	+ delete user accounts, and
	+ assign security roles (except when inviting a new user)
* **Admin users**
 have all access rights to content and user permissions.

###
 Using a Hub

It’s recommended that you create an individual hub—an implementation page, scratch pad, or whatever works for you—to house all the content you will be sharing. If you have a central point to go to for what you want to share, then you know which cards/DataSets/pages you are sharing out and can easily access that content.

###
 Using Groups

Use groups to share out content in Domo. By setting up specific groups, you can easily share out the relevant data for that group and be able to monitor who has access to the content that you’ve shared.


 For more information about groups, see

###
 Understanding Your Users

When sharing and organizing data, think about the type of data consumers you have and the way they want to consume the data. For example, you may have some or all of the following:

 Consumers who will just be looking at data on mobile.
* Consumers who need to receive scheduled reports.
* Consumers who will be building cards and creating their own dashboards.
* Consumers who will need only one DataSet---share out one quick card to that person to build on.
* Groups that needs to view only specific cards relevant to their divisions.
