You\u00a0can be Alerted based on\n                        \n                         any\n                        \n                        change or addition to your data. Unlike traditional Alerts, these can be built on multiple trigger rules. And the Alert message can include complex calculations and even data from other DataSets, making the custom message more customizable\u00a0and more useful.\n                       \n\n                        For example, let's say user Barry is a sales manager for his company. He wants to know the exact moment that a new deal closes, along with any pertinent information about the deal, such as the salesperson who closed the deal, the name of the customer, the amount of the deal, the number of consulting hours purchased, and so on. Before DataSet Alerts, Barry could only set Alerts on the Card level. These Alerts would indicate that a predefined threshold had been surpassed but could not relay any other data from the DataSet. But now, with DataSet Alerts, Barry can set an Alert on the DataSet level. The Alert message can include\n                        \n                         any\n                        \n                        information from the DataSet, including all of the data Barry wanted.\n                       \n\n                        Barry's Alert message as created in Domo\u00a0looks as follows:\n                       \n\n\n                         [Sales Rep], on the [Sales Team] team, closed a deal with [Account Name] for [Deal Amount]. This deal includes [# of Users] users and [# of Consulting Hours Purchased] consulting hours (at a rate of [Consulting Rate] per hour). The competitor for this deal was [Competitor Name]. This opportunity was created on [Opportunity Start Date] from a [Lead Type].\n                        \n\n\n                        Thereafter, when a deal closes, the Alert message that is sent out is populated with the data from the indicated columns. This message might appear as follows:\n                       \n\n                        \"Darcy McKay, on the Corporate team, closed a deal with Kablinko Toys for $23,560. This deal includes 12 users and 8 consulting hours (at a rate of $225 per hour). The competitor for this deal was Red Puffin Electronics. This opportunity was created on 08-12-2017 from a Marketing-generated Lead.\"\n                       \n\n                        You manage DataSet Alerts in the Alert Center, just as with Card Alerts. There you can edit rules and messages, change your notification settings, see the Alert history, share Alerts with other users, and subscribe to other DataSet Alerts.\u00a0For more information about the Alert Center, see\n                        \n                         Alert Center Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Using DataSet Alerts\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating a DataSet\u00a0Alert\n                       \n\n                        You create DataSet Alerts in the Data Center, in the\n                        \n                         details view for the DataSet\n                        \n                        .

These changes include rows being added, changed, or deleted from the DataSet. For example, you might have an Alert set to trigger when a row for a new customer account is added to your sales DataSet.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             The following DataSet types do not support row Alerts:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                               Fusions\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               Views\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               Appends\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               Upserts\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               Federated DataSets\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n                               DataSets with more than 1M rows.\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        When you choose an individual row option, two additional configuration options appear. The first of these,\n                        \n                         Add Filter\n                        \n                        ,\u00a0is optional. Here, you can set your Alert to trigger\n                        \n                         only\n                        \n                        when specific rows are added, changed, or deleted. To do this, you choose the desired column in the\n                        \n                         Metric\n                        \n                        menu, select an operator in the\n                        \n                         Meets this condition\n                        \n                        menu, then enter or select the desired value in the\n                        \n                         For this value\n                        \n                        field. So for example, if user Fiona only wants to receive Alerts when the \"Marketing\" department is impacted, she would select\n                        \n                         Department\n                        \n                        in the first menu and\n                        \n                         Is equal to\n                        \n\n                         (=)\n                        \n                        in the second menu, then check the box for \"Marketing\" in the blank field.\n                        \n\n                        You can add additional filters by clicking\n                        \n                         Add Filter\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        By adding multiple filters, you can build complex Alert rules for your DataSets. For example, let's say I have a DataSet\u00a0that includes rows for customer deals in the pipeline. I want to receive an Alert\n                        \n                         only\n                        \n                        when these three criteria are met:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          I have won the deal (indicated by the \"isWon\" column being set to \"True\").\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The deal was previously open (indicated by the \"isClosed\" column being previously set to \"False\").\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The deal is now closed (indicated by the \"isClosed\" column being now set to \"True\").\n                         \n\n\n\n                        I could build a single rule incorporating all three of these criteria. by creating three separate filters, as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        The second option asks you to select\u00a0one or more columns that identify a row in this DataSet as unique. In the previous example, I specified \"AccountID\" as this column because the account ID is unique for every row. Unlike the filters option, this is required to proceed.\n                       \n\n                        Column aggregation Alerts\n                        \n\n\n\n                        Column aggregation Alerts\u00a0occur when the aggregation for a column meets a specified threshold, just as with Card Alerts. For example, you might have an Alert set to trigger when the sum of the \"Total Budget\" column for your DataSet\u00a0falls below a certain value.\n                       \n\n                        To build a column aggregation Alert, you first choose a column in the\n                        \n                         Metric\n                        \n                        menu, followed by the desired aggregation. Different aggregation types are available depending on the data type of the selected column.\n                       \n\n                        Available aggregations for string columns are as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Unique Count\n                          \n                          . The number of unique values in the column (i.e. if a value appears more than once, it is only counted once).\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Null Count\n                          \n                          .

When this box is checked, instead of sending out a single Notification as soon as the Alert enters a triggered state (which is the default functionality), Domo\u00a0sends out Notifications based on the selected frequency\n                        \n                         until the Alert conditions are no longer met\n                        \n                        . For example, let's say user Gus creates the Alert rule \"Summary Number is less than 500,\" selects\n                        \n                         Weekly\n                        \n                        as the frequency, then checks this box. As soon as the Summary Number surpasses 500, a Notification is sent. Then, as long as the Summary Number remains above 500, new Notifications are sent on the specified weekday at the specified time. If the number drops below 500, Notifications will stop being sent. If, on the other hand, Gus doesn't check this box, only an initial Notification is sent when the Alert is triggered.\n                       \n\n                        The\n                        \n                         Keep sending notifications while in a triggered state\n                        \n                        checkbox appears only for threshold-based Alerts, as opposed to those one-time Alerts that trigger when a certain degree of change is met. For example, for an \"Is greater than\" Alert (e.g. an Alert that triggers when its value surpasses 1000), this box would be available because the Alert still applies as long as the value remains above the threshold. But for a \"Changes by\"\u00a0Alert, the box is not available because once the given value is reached, only a single Notification needs be sent\u2014the Alert's work is then done.\n                       \n\n                        Customizing Your Alert Message\n                       \n\n                        In Step 2 of the wizard, you can customize the Notification message that is sent whenever the Alert is triggered. You can choose from a wide variety of macros to include in the message. Macros are used to reference different variables related to your Alert, such as Alert name, Alert owner, current or previous value of the rule column, the time the Alert was last triggered at, and so on. With individual row Alerts, you can configure the message header, body, and footer separately.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        You can see a list of macros by clicking the\n                        \n                         Metric\n                        \n                        button. Where available, the list shows you the name of the corresponding variable in your Alert so you know if you are pulling over the right information.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        If you edit the custom message then decide you want to revert it back to the default, you can do so by clicking\n                        \n                         Restore Default\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Attaching an action\n                       \n\n                        Alert Actions drive powerful action for your business by triggering events such as Webhook integration with third-party systems and Projects & Tasks integrations in Domo.
