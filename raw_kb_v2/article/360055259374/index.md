Intro
-------

Code Block apps allow you to quickly find and copy sample code that you can use for R, Python, or Beast Mode applications. Code Block apps in Domo make advanced functionality more accessible allowing you to spend more time collaborating around your data and business questions rather than determining how to best write code.


 Code Block Apps
-----------------

You can find Code Block apps by navigating to the

Appstore

and simply searching for Code Block. In the App Details view, seen below, you can either copy directly from the code block or click the Copy to Clipboard button. Then, paste the code in the medium you're working in, adjust the columns and parameters to align with your data, and you're ready to go.

*Code Block apps are currently available for the following code types:**

 Beast Mode
* SQL
* R
* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
