Code Block apps in Domo\u00a0make advanced functionality more accessible allowing\u00a0you to spend\u00a0more time collaborating around your data and business questions rather than determining how to best write code.\n\n\n Code Block Apps\n-----------------\n\nYou can find Code Block apps by navigating to the\n\nAppstore\n\nand simply searching for Code Block. In the App Details view, seen below, you can either copy directly from the code block or click\u00a0the Copy to Clipboard button. Then, paste the code in the medium you're working in, adjust the columns and parameters to align with your data, and you're ready to go.\n\n*Code Block apps are currently available for the following code types:**\n\n Beast Mode\n* SQL\n* R\n* Python\n* Jupyter Notebooks\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360055259374\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004139\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCode Block Apps\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,755\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:24 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "code_block_apps", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_custom_visualizations", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZampGAC"}, {"text": "available_apps", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan9GAC"}]}
