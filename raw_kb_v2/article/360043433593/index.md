Adobe Analytics helps you create a holistic view of your business by turning customer interactions into actionable insights. Domo's Adobe Analytics connector allows you to retrieve data through prebuilt reports or customized reports or by submitting a query to the Adobe Analytics API. You can then combine metrics with data from CRM, POS, or any other system to make faster, better-informed business decisions. To learn more about the Adobe Analytics API, visit


 https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/en\_US/get-started/introduction/c-introduction


 .

You connect to the Adobe Analytics API in the Data Center.

This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Adobe Analytics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------


 To connect to the Adobe Analytics and create a DataSet, you must have the Client ID and Client Secret associated with your Adobe Analytics account.


 Visit

Adobe Oauth Connection

documentation to learn more about obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret.

 FAQs
-------


####

Q: When should I use this connector?


 A: This connector has been deprecated and cannot be used to power up any new datasets.


####
 Q: I successfully created an Adobe Analytics OAuth account, but about two weeks later I got an alert: "Account Adobe Analytics OAuth Account has been Deactivated". Why is this happening and what can I do about it?

A: Adobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see

Adobe documentation

for details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username:Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication. Please contact Adobe support to request a resolution to this issue.

###

Q: My Adobe

Analytics datasets are failing intermittently and displaying unhelpful error messages like

"Unable to complete report at this time. Please try again later." What should I do?


 A: This error originates on


 Adobe


 ’s end. Unfortunately, it is nothing we at Domo have direct control over, but we are working with


 Adobe


 to improve these types of errors. That said, you can take steps to alleviate the occurrence of these errors, which include reducing the number of connectors, the frequency at which they try to pull data, and the size of their requests. Attempting to schedule requests to run at different times can also help. Another possible solution is to use the “retry” setting in the connector.
