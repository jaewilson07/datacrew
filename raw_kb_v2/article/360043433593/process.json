Adobe Analytics OAuth Account has been Deactivated\". Why is this happening and what can I do about it?\n                        \n\n                         A: Adobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see\n                         \n                          Adobe documentation\n                         \n                         for details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username:Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication. Please contact Adobe support to request a resolution to this issue.\n                        \n\n\n                          Q: My Adobe\n                         \n                         Analytics datasets are failing intermittently and displaying unhelpful error messages like\n                         \n\n\n                          \"Unable to complete report at this time.

That said, you can take steps to alleviate the occurrence of these errors, which include reducing the number of connectors, the frequency at which they try to pull data, and the size of their requests. Attempting to schedule requests to run at different times can also help. Another possible solution is to use the \u201cretry\u201d setting in the connector.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360043433593", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
