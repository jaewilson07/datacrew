Some factors considered will exclude the DataFlow from being eligible to be system disabled while others depend on the amount of time something hasn\u2019t been used.\n                        \n\n                        The primary consideration given when Domo evaluates whether a DataFlow should be disabled is the length of time that DataFlow has been unused.\n                       \n\n                        What does \u201cunused\u201d mean?\n                       \n\n                        Usage is defined as meaningful consumption of a DataFlow\u2019s output DataSets in any way.
