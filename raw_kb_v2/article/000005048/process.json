Its main purpose is to display your data in different ways on a map to gain geographical and relational insights from the data. The app can map out various sets of locations and related data for those locations, create and display geographical territories to show the boundaries inside which mapped locations lie, and display heat maps to correlate locations with important metrics or demographics.\n                        \n\n                        Before you begin using the app, make sure you have completed all the required configurations.
