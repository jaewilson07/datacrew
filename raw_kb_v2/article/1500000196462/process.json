It's a reliable and efficient way to harness the power of cloud computing and scale your company's technological capabilities, but it's critical. You have a way to monitor usage so you don't run into surprises and can easily budget for your access to the cloud.\n                        \n\n\n                         The AWS Cost and Usage connector provides visibility into your organization's AWS usage, letting you optimize your AWS spend.\n                        \n\n                         Get all the critical metrics you need in one glance, drilling down to get more detailed information when needed.\n                        \n\n\n                        The AWS Cost & Usage Report contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, and reservations (Example: Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs)). With this connector you can pull your most updated AWS Cost and Usage report data. The first run of the connector pulls data from the current year. Subsequent runs pull historical data. During subsequent runs, the connector will also look at the modified dates on the files and re-pull any modified data. For more information about the AWS API, visit their website (\n                        \n                         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/auth-request-sig-v2.html\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your AWS Cost and Usage account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the AWS Cost and Usage connector user interface.
