The Webhook link includes a long-living single use token so anyone with the link can publish data to your DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        You set up your JSON\u00a0Webhook connection by configuring options in the\u00a0Data Center as well as in the third-party application, as described in continuation.\n                       \n\n\n                         Video - Creating a JSON Webhook DataSet\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Setting up a JSON Webhook Connection\n                       \n\n\n                         This section explains how to set up a JSON Webhook\u00a0connection in Domo and in the third-party application.\u00a0Once you have set up a successful connection, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new JSON Webhook DataSet.
