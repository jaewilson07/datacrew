If you specify\u00a0between 2 and 31 days of data, daily data will be returned. If you specify one day of data, hourly data is returned. If you specify\u00a0more than 31 days but fewer than 28 weeks, weekly data is returned. If you specify more than 28 weeks, monthly data is returned.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042926394\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003807\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nApple News Publisher Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,644\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "apple_news_publisher_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
