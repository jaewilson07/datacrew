With Domo's Google Sheets Writeback Workload identity federation connector, you can transfer your data from a Domo dataset to your Google Sheet. To learn more about the Google API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.google.com\n\n).\n\n\n You export data to Google Sheets in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Sheets Writeback\u00a0Workload Identity Federation connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need the following:\n\n A project created in the Google Developers Console with the Google Sheets API enabled.\n* A Google Service Token JSON\u00a0file.\n\nThe following steps explain in detail how to create your project and obtain the needed credentials.\n\n##\n Step 1: Creating a Project in the Google Developers Console\n\nTo create a project in the Google Developers Console, do the following:\n\n. Go to\n\nhttps://console.developers.google.com\n\n.\n2. Click the dropdown arrow next to\n **My Project**\n .\n3. Click\n **New Project**\n .\n4. Name your project and select the parent folder.\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n You can also use an existing project if you want.\n\n\n###\n Step 2: Enabling the Google Sheets API\n\nTo enable the Google Sheets for your project, do the following:\n\n. In the Google Developers Console, select your project and click\n **Library**\n .\n2. Search for the Google Sheets API.\n3. Click\n **Enable**\n .\n\n\n###\n Step 3: Creating a Service Account\n\nTo create a Service Account, do the following:\n\n. In the Google Developers Console, open the\n **Credentials**\n tab.\n2. Click\n **+ Create Credentials**\n then select\n **Service account**\n .\n3. Name the new Service account.\n4. Click\n **Create and Continue**\n .\n5. In the\n **Role**\n dropdown, select\n **Basic > Owner**\n .\n6. Click\n **Done**\n .\n7. Click on the Email field under\n **Service Accounts**\n .\n8. Click on the\n **Keys**\n option.\n9. Click\n **Add Key**\n and then select\n **Create New Key**\n .\n10. Choose\n **JSON**\n , click\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n Select a safe location for the file as you will need it soon.\n11. Copy the email address for the project you created.\n12. Open\n\nhttps://sheets.google.com\n\nand create a new sheet.\n13. Share the sheet with the email address you copied in step 11. (The email address owner must have at least Editor-level privileges.)\n14. Copy the URL to the spreadsheet, as you will need it later.\n\nThe spreadsheet URL should look similar to the following:\n\ndocs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<googlesheetID>/edit#gid=0\n\n\n###\n Step 4: Creating a Workload Identity Pool and Provider\n\nFollow the steps given below to create a Workload Identity Pool and Provider:\n\n. In the\n **Google Developers Console**\n , open the.\n **Workload Identity Federation**\n tab.\n2. Create a new workload identity pool and provide the required details.\n3. Add a new identity provider to the pool and provide required details.\n4. Click\n **Continue**\n .\n5. Grant access to the required service account.\n6. Select the required service account and identity provider and get the configuration JSON file.\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google Sheets\u00a0Writeback Workload Identity Federation Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account as well as your Google Sheet. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n External Account Config JSON Key\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0external account config JSON key.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Google Sheets connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo dataset ID(GUID) located in the dataset url. Example:\n\nhttps://customer.domo.com/datasources/<strong>aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee</strong>/details/settings\n\n|\n|\n Input Sheet ID\n  |\n Enter the GoogleSheet ID that has been shared with the Service Account you created. Example:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<strong>18zN0RQ8HIaEj2USwtAkCMX7AKBl-x-\\_vq24kPd4\\_Tsk</strong>/edit#gid=0<br>Note\n\n- all data in this sheet will be replaced\n  |\n|\n Sheet Name\n  |\n\nEnter the sheet name.\n\n\n**Note:**\n By default, the sheet name will be\n **Sheet1**\n .\n\n|\n\n\n Adding Caller Permission while Debugging\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe following steps allow you to add caller permissions:\n\n. Create a service account using the Google Developer Console.\n\nhttps://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/\n2. Under\n **Options**\n , create a key.\n\n\n This key is your usual\n **client\\_secret.json**\n .\n3. Make the role owner for the service account (\n **Member name = service account ID = service account email**\n ).\n\n\n Example:\n\nthomasapp@appname-201813.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n4. Copy the email address of your service account = service account ID.\n5. Navigate to your browser to the Google sheet you want to interact with.\n6. Click\n **SHARE**\n on the top right of your screen.\n7. Navigate to the advanced settings and share it with an email address of your service account.\n\n\n Example:\n\nthomasapp@appname-201813.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the service account key JSON of your Google Sheets Service Account.\n\n###\n Where can I find my service account key JSON?\n\nTo find your service account key JSON:\n\n Open the IAM & Admin page in the GCP Console.\n* In the left navigation, click Service accounts.\n* Select your project and click Open.\n* Click Create Service Account.\n* Enter a service account name and service account description.
