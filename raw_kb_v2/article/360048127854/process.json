Machine learning (ML) is the next step to provide insight to complex business problems, improve decision-making, and automate business processes. However, many organizations don\u2019t have the data science expertise to create a machine learning model for their data. Additionally, organizations who have data science teams are often drowning in opportunities and spend months exploring different business problems without ever getting their machine learning solutions into production. AutoML provides a solution in these situations.\n                       \n\n                        Domo and AWS: A partnership for success\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        We\u2019re thrilled to announce that machine learning is now within everyone\u2019s grasp with our new automated machine learning (AutoML). In partnership with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, we\u2019ve created AutoML capabilities that allow you to augment your analytics with machine learning, whether you\u2019re a data scientist or a data science novice, then share those insights with anyone. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) solution that automatically trains and tunes ML models based on data provided by a customer. Companies can now use their data in Domo as input into Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, automatically create the highest performing model and deploy a prediction pipeline that adapts to new, incoming data. The combination of Domo and Amazon SageMaker Autopilot helps make ML accessible to more employees and propels ML-driven insights for business.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             This feature is available\n                             \n                              on demand and paid\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            To request this feature be enabled,\n                           \n\n\n\n                              Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager, Technical Consultant, or Account Executive.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              If you do not have contact information for your CSM, TC, or AE, contact Technical Support.

With just a few clicks, AutoML will transform your data to be ready for machine learning and launch hundreds of training jobs on any DataSet in Domo to find the model that achieves the best performance for your task. You can then easily deploy the model on your Domo DataSets with the new\n                        \n                         AutoML Interface\n                        \n                        tile in Magic ETL.

Spend some time gathering your data together into one DataSet that has one column with\u00a0the output variable (the variable you want to predict that AutoML will train on) and many columns that enumerate the inputs that you expect to have an effect/influence on your output column. Be sure to only include one output column for your DataSet. Additionally, each row should encapsulate one record in your business problem. For example, if you would like to predict which sales opportunity will close, each row should enumerate one distinct sales opportunity, from start to finish, with the output column listing the result of the sales opportunity (ie won or lost).\n                       \n\n                        There are many wonderful blog posts, courses, books and videos on data cleaning for machine learning that you can find online or Domo\u2019s professional services team are always a resource at your disposal to enhance your data cleaning skillset.\n                       \n\n                        How to Launch an AutoML Training Job\n                       \n\n                        Below are instructions on how you can use AutoML along with a sample DataSet for you to try.
