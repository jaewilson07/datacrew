For more information about the Microsoft SQL Server API, visit their website. (\n\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa174556(v=sql.80).aspx\n\n).\n\n\n The Microsoft SQL Server Partition connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from databases using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n ********Database********\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft SQL Server in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft SQL Server Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database and create a DataSet, have your DBA create an account that has read-only access to the databases and tables you need to access. You must have all of the following to connect:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your Microsoft SQL Server account\n* The host name for the database\n* The port number for the database\n* The name of the database\n\nYou can also include the URL where your SSL CA Certificate is located, though this is optional.\n\n\n Before you can connect to your Microsoft SQL server, you must also white list a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Microsoft SQL Server Database\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the\u00a0Microsoft SQL Server Partition\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Microsoft SQL Server database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Microsoft SQL Server account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to log into your Microsoft SQL Server account.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the database.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the database.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\u00a0(optional)\n  |\n Enter the URL where the SSL CA Certificate is located.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Microsoft SQL Server\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Microsoft SQL Server\u00a0Partition\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to use in selecting the data you want.\n\n\n Example:\u00a0select DATE from Employee\n  |\n|\n Table Name\n  |\n Select the table containing the data you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to get data for. Value can be a positive integer. For example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ********************************yyyy-MM-dd********************************\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date Format\n  |\n Enter the custom date format.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360058716553\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003978\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,713\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "microsoft_sql_server_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
