Through Domo\u2019s collaboration with AWS, you will be able to access and integrate any data you\u2019ve subscribed to from AWS Data Exchange directly in Domo and easily get that data into the hands of anyone across the business. AWS Data Exchange is a new service that makes it easy for millions of AWS customers to securely find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud.\n                       \n\n                        Domo also announced Appstore enhancements that make it even easier to find and build solutions that drive business forward with data.

For example, you can use them to show where money came from and went to (budgets, contributions, etc.), flows of energy from source to destination, and flows of goods from place to place.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about Sankey\u00a0charts, see\n                        \n                         Sankey Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Multi-value gauge\n                       \n\n                        With multi-value gauges, you can display a summary number along with a second value showing the positive or negative degree of change.\u00a0You can aggregate the current value of the gauge using any of a variety of aggregation functions (sum, average, minimum or maximum value, etc.). You can also show the degree of change as a percentage or a value. In addition, a number of other customization options are available.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Multi-Value Gauge\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        SPC chart\n                       \n\n                        SPC\u00a0(statistical\u00a0process control) charts, also known as control charts,\u00a0Shewhart charts,\u00a0or\u00a0process-behavior charts, are line charts\u00a0used to determine if a\u00a0manufacturing\u00a0or\u00a0business process\u00a0is in a state of\u00a0control. Domo's\u00a0SPC charts lets you set up rules from SPC\u00a0standards by configuring\u00a0them in the Chart Properties. When values outside the specified rules\u00a0are encountered, these are flagged in the chart as outliers. There are 8 rules you can configure for SPC charts in Domo. You can have one SPC rule per chart or combine them.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         SPC Charts\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Shape gauge\n                       \n\n                        A shape gauge uses any of 45 different images to indicate a current value. By using different images to indicate different ranges, you can convey to users whether the current value is positive, neutral, or negative. Available images include different shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, pentagons, and octagons; thumbs up/thumbs down; airplanes taking off and landing; and more.\u00a0In addition, you can vary shapes by customizing their\u00a0colors, giving you even more options to choose from. You can have up to 10 ranges in a shape gauge.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Shape Gauge\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Mega table\n                       \n\n                        A mega table provides all of the same functionality as\u00a0a standard table\u00a0or\u00a0heat map table\u00a0but includes much more as well.

Any language that is supported in Domo\u00a0(English, Japanese, French, Spanish, German and Simplified Chinese)\u00a0is now supported in\u00a0Workbench. Now you can easily navigate, tackle tasks, and get up to speed even more quickly on new features with Workbench in your language. You can select your language on\u00a0install, or\u00a0choose it later on in Settings.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In addition to localizing languages, Workbench is also simplifying the Workbench experience by localizing dates and numbers. Now dates and numbers will appear in the format standard for your locale. Simply set your Workbench machine to your locale and choose to use the system language in Workbench, and Workbench will automatically sync to provide region formatted dates and numbers both in Workbench and in your data preview.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Workbench group scheduling\n                       \n\n                        Create job dependencies or select jobs to run as a group. Now if a job fails in your data pipeline, you can stop subsequent jobs from running. Or, if you need to wait for your source data systems to finish updating, you can schedule a group of jobs to run at the same time after your source data is ready.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Scheduling a Job in Workbench 5\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Workbench advanced\u00a0scheduling\n                       \n\n                        Now you have more flexibility to schedule jobs when you need them.

With AES Encryption, when you move Workbench jobs to a new machine, your credentials move along with them, meaning you do not need to reenter them every time you make a switch. And as a bonus, AES Encryption includes all of the latest security features.\n                       \n\n                        Workbench query builder\n                       \n\n                        Write queries in Workbench without knowing your data structure. Workbench will load table and column names from your database as you write your query so you can feel confident that your queries will be accurate. Query Builder is available for all of our largest databases\u2014MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Workbench DataSync\n                       \n\n                        Getting a new DataSet into Domo\u00a0via Workbench is now just a drag and drop away.

This creates a CSV export of the data and includes it as an attachment. For busy executives and business users, this makes it easy to perform quick, ad-hoc analyses on snapshots of data using the tools of your choice. This also helps you interface seamlessly with customers and colleagues by giving you a way to easily share important data with them on a recurring schedule.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Note that this functionality is only available for Scheduled Reports on individual Cards, not for Dashboards. Also note that the export includes only the data used to power the Card,\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        the entire DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Scheduling Reports\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Disabling of Card interactions\n                       \n\n                        Keep users on a \"guided path\" in your Domo Stories by disabling interactions on Cards in those Stories. This option is found in the \"Card interaction settings\" for a given card and, when selected, prevents any actions from occurring when a user clicks on the Card. In addition, no buttons or highlighting appear when hovering with the cursor. This gives you the freedom to use text and images as design elements in your Stories without distracting from important content.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Along with this, a new\n                        \n                         Card Options button\n                        \n                        option is also available in the\n                        \n                         Display Settings\n                        \n                        menu that appears when you click the\n                        \n                         Edit Content\n                        \n                        button for a Card in the Story edit view.
