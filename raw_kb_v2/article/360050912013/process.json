It also makes it possible to navigate to all of Domo\u2019s most used features in fewer clicks, decreasing the time it takes you to perform actions in Domo and get answers. For more information, watch this\n\ndemo video\n\n.\n\n\n Here\u2019s a highlight list of some of the most notable improvements:\n\n##\n Improved UI\n\nThe Pages menu has been moved to the left side\u00a0of the screen in a scrollable\u00a0\"Dashboards\" list. You can collapse this list, providing\u00a0more space when you want to focus on important dashboard content. If you want you can still show the list when it is in its collapsed state.\u00a0The list is searchable too, allowing you to quickly filter\u00a0down the list of Pages as you type.\n\nYou will also find shortcuts to your most important Domo functions now exposed at the top of the screen, giving you quicker access.\n\n##\n\nThird-level Pages\n\nAn additional level of Page\u00a0hierarchy lets you create Subpages\u00a0of your Subpages. You have more options than ever for how you organize your Pages\u00a0to show related information.\n\n\n###\n\nFavorite Pages\n\nYou can now mark Pages as \"favorites,\"\u00a0making it easier for you to get to your most important content in Domo. You can add any Page as a\u00a0\"favorite\" Page by choosing the\n **Add to favorites**\n option in the wrench menu for the Page.\n\nOnce a Page is added as a Favorite, you can jump to it quickly by clicking\n ****Favorites****\n at the top of the Pages list and selecting the Page you want to open.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nNew Navigation Announcement\n\n.\n\n\n New Domo Everywhere features\n------------------------------\n\n\n###\n Story Embed\n\nExpand beyond individual iFrames for each Card towards a single unified iFrame for an entire Story that easily\u00a0scales to all your partners and customers. Simply copy the embed code from the story\n **Share**\n dialog and paste it into your portals or applications. Now the power of the platform is available to everyone\u2014even outside your company.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nSharing Cards and Stories Outside of Domo Using Domo Embed (BETA)\n\n.\n\n##\n Programmatic Filter Embed\n\nBy using programmatic filtering with Domo Embed, you can distribute personalized content in portals and software at scale. You can share your Domo content with an unlimited number of viewers, even if they do not have Domo accounts.\n\n\n Programmatic filters provide all of the following benefits:\n\n Showing only approved and relevant content for the viewer.\n* Decreasing the number of PDP policies you need to manage.\n* Eliminating the need for viewers of embedded content to be full Domo users.\n* Decreasing the risk of viewers logging into the full instance.\n\nFilters are defined in your code based on the login credentials of your systems instead of Domo data permissions policies. This ensures that viewers only see approved subsets of the data even if you choose not to integrate your identity provider or automate the provisioning of users in Domo.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nUsing Programmatic Filters with Domo Embed (BETA)\n\n.\n\n\n New Appstore\u00a0UI\n-----------------\n\nIn February, Domo launched the next generation of the Domo Appstore including a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed to help users modernize any business process and get BI leverage at cloud scale in record time. Through Domo\u2019s collaboration with AWS, you will be able to access and integrate any data you\u2019ve subscribed to from AWS Data Exchange directly in Domo and easily get that data into the hands of anyone across the business. AWS Data Exchange is a new service that makes it easy for millions of AWS customers to securely find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud.\n\n\n Domo also announced Appstore enhancements that make it even easier to find and build solutions that drive business forward with data. These new additions include the following:\n\n New enterprise apps that leverage data from different business systems to modernize common business functions including finance and sales operations; and new writeback connectors to modernize workflows.\n* Improved navigation to make it easier to find business-ready apps that help instrument key processes like sales commissioning, vendor contract management or retail performance.\n* A more robust SDK to allow in-house developers and partners to build and deliver custom business-ready apps in just days or weeks, rather than the typical months, quarters, or years associated with traditional app development.\n* A public-facing portal to help increase access to the type of innovation that is possible with Domo and Domo apps.\n\nAll apps in the Domo Appstore leverage the power of the Domo Business Cloud, making it quick and easy connect to virtually any data source and make that data more valuable for teams and organizations anywhere.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAppstore Layout\n\n.\n\n\n Data Impact Analysis\n----------------------\n\nDomo's Data Impact Analysis tool, available in the details view for a DataSet, helps you understand\u00a0the impact of actions you take on your DataSets.\n\n\n This tool includes all of the following functions:\n\n ****Impact card****\n . A\u00a0new card in the\n ********Overview********\n tab shows you the number of DataSets, DataFlows, Cards, and Alerts directly and indirectly impacted by changes to that DataSet. The card displays the direct impact for each, along with the total number of impacts.\n* ****Lineage view****\n .\u00a0This view shows you the upstream and downstream impact of changes made to the DataSet. You can also see the lineage for a DataSet\u00a0simply by clicking on the\n ********Lineage********\n tab.\n* ****Info panel****\n . This panel shows the owner, the number of direct and indirect impacts on downstream elements, input and outset DataSets (for DataFlows and DataFusions), the update history, and the number of rows and columns (for DataSets).\n* ****List panel****\n . This panel allows you to see all of the individual DataSets, DataFlows, Cards, and Alerts powered by this DataSet.\n\nFor more information about using this feature, see\n\nViewing the Impact of Changes to DataSets\n\n.\n\n\n New chart types\n-----------------\n\nWe have added a number of exciting new chart types to Analyzer to better enable you to tell the data stories you want. These charts include the following:\n\n##\n Sankey chart\n\nSankey charts are ideal for showing flow information from business activities. For example, you can use them to show where money came from and went to (budgets, contributions, etc.), flows of energy from source to destination, and flows of goods from place to place.\n\nFor more information about Sankey\u00a0charts, see\n\nSankey Chart\n\n.\n\n##\n Multi-value gauge\n\nWith multi-value gauges, you can display a summary number along with a second value showing the positive or negative degree of change.\u00a0You can aggregate the current value of the gauge using any of a variety of aggregation functions (sum, average, minimum or maximum value, etc.). You can also show the degree of change as a percentage or a value. In addition, a number of other customization options are available.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nMulti-Value Gauge\n\n.\n\n##\n SPC chart\n\nSPC\u00a0(statistical\u00a0process control) charts, also known as control charts,\u00a0Shewhart charts,\u00a0or\u00a0process-behavior charts, are line charts\u00a0used to determine if a\u00a0manufacturing\u00a0or\u00a0business process\u00a0is in a state of\u00a0control. Domo's\u00a0SPC charts lets you set up rules from SPC\u00a0standards by configuring\u00a0them in the Chart Properties. When values outside the specified rules\u00a0are encountered, these are flagged in the chart as outliers. There are 8 rules you can configure for SPC charts in Domo. You can have one SPC rule per chart or combine them.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nSPC Charts\n\n.\n\n##\n Shape gauge\n\nA shape gauge uses any of 45 different images to indicate a current value. By using different images to indicate different ranges, you can convey to users whether the current value is positive, neutral, or negative. Available images include different shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, pentagons, and octagons; thumbs up/thumbs down; airplanes taking off and landing; and more.\u00a0In addition, you can vary shapes by customizing their\u00a0colors, giving you even more options to choose from. You can have up to 10 ranges in a shape gauge.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nShape Gauge\n\n.\n\n##\n Mega table\n\nA mega table provides all of the same functionality as\u00a0a standard table\u00a0or\u00a0heat map table\u00a0but includes much more as well. In a mega table, you can do all of the following:\n\n Include\u00a0up to 25,000 rows.\n* Collapse and expand, sort, and scroll while on a Page.\n* Include HTML links and images.\n* Apply predefined or custom date formatting to specific columns. The\n **Date Shorthand**\n and\n **Full Date**\n predefined options both take your locale into consideration when used; for example, if your locale is Japan, a Japanese date format will be applied automatically if you select either of these options.\n* Transpose your table data, i.e. switch the rows and columns, which may be useful if your table has too many columns to see easily.\n* Preserve all of the formatting when exporting a Domo table to Excel, including cell/row/column formats, Page and Card Filters, and even pivot views. In the following screenshot, the first table is from Domo, and the second is the same table when exported to Excel:\n\nFor more information, see\n\nTable Chart\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Pivot table\n\nPivot tables provide a more powerful alternative to\u00a0standard tables\u00a0in Domo.\u00a0They allow you to quickly and easily summarize large quantities of data from a DataSet as well as explore data by different dimensions and measures.\u00a0Pivot table functionality has long been available in Domo in the form of\n\nPivot Table\n\n.\n\n##\n New POP charts\n\nSix new period-over-period chart types are now available in Domo, giving you even more flexibility in telling your business story. The new chart types include running total line, multi-value gauge, shape gauge, flex table, filled gauge, and progress bar.\n\n\n New chart improvements\n------------------------\n\nThis release includes all of the following improvements to our charting functionality:\n\n##\n New options for scatter plots\n\nNow you have even more flexibility when building scatter plot charts. More options are available for customizing the look of the points in the chart. In addition, you now have the ability to set data label options and tooltip fields. This enables you to set grid-like charts with informative data labels and hover text.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCustomizing scatter plot charts\n\n.\n\n##\n More charts in Popular tab\n\nThe \"Popular\" tab\u00a0in the Chart Picker now contains more of our most commonly used chart types, allowing you to quickly select these chart types without having to first open another Chart Picker tab.\n\n##\n New properties for trellises and tiered dates\n\nYou can now customize trellis charts and tiered dates by configuring a number of new Chart Properties. These properties include the ability to toggle trellises and tiered dates on and off, to set the divider color, to set word wrapping, and so on.\n\nFor more information about these properties, see\n\nProperties Available for Most Charts\n\n.\n\n##\n Recent weighted forecasting\n\nA new Chart Property is now available when using multi-period projections\u00a0in your charts\u2014\n **Linear Regression Recent Weighted**\n . This projection method puts more weight on the recent periods in your data. Use this option if recent periods are more valuable in your data than earlier periods.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nProjecting the Last Value in Your Chart\n\n.\n\n##\n Remove button for columns relocated\n\nIn the interest of making the Analyzer user interface more intuitive for first-time users, the \"x\" button that allowed you to remove columns from a chart has been replaced with a standard v-shaped dropdown button that opens the column options dialog, and a\n **Remove**\n button has been added to this dialog.\n\nWorkbench improvements\n------------------------\n\n\n###\n Workbench localization\n\nWorkbench now supports localization in several\u00a0languages. Any language that is supported in Domo\u00a0(English, Japanese, French, Spanish, German and Simplified Chinese)\u00a0is now supported in\u00a0Workbench. Now you can easily navigate, tackle tasks, and get up to speed even more quickly on new features with Workbench in your language. You can select your language on\u00a0install, or\u00a0choose it later on in Settings.\n\nIn addition to localizing languages, Workbench is also simplifying the Workbench experience by localizing dates and numbers. Now dates and numbers will appear in the format standard for your locale. Simply set your Workbench machine to your locale and choose to use the system language in Workbench, and Workbench will automatically sync to provide region formatted dates and numbers both in Workbench and in your data preview.\n\n\n###\n Workbench group scheduling\n\nCreate job dependencies or select jobs to run as a group. Now if a job fails in your data pipeline, you can stop subsequent jobs from running. Or, if you need to wait for your source data systems to finish updating, you can schedule a group of jobs to run at the same time after your source data is ready.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nScheduling a Job in Workbench 5\n\n.\n\n##\n Workbench advanced\u00a0scheduling\n\nNow you have more flexibility to schedule jobs when you need them. Set an exact time, choose specific days of the week or month, or opt in to different hourly intervals directly from Workbench.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nScheduling a Job in Workbench 5\n\n.\n\n##\n Workbench improved server migration\n\nMigrate Workbench jobs seamlessly and painlessly between machines using AES Encryption. With AES Encryption, when you move Workbench jobs to a new machine, your credentials move along with them, meaning you do not need to reenter them every time you make a switch. And as a bonus, AES Encryption includes all of the latest security features.\n\n##\n Workbench query builder\n\nWrite queries in Workbench without knowing your data structure. Workbench will load table and column names from your database as you write your query so you can feel confident that your queries will be accurate. Query Builder is available for all of our largest databases\u2014MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n\n\n###\n Workbench DataSync\n\nGetting a new DataSet into Domo\u00a0via Workbench is now just a drag and drop away. With DataSync, now you can create a new DataSet in Domo simply by adding an Excel or CSV file to the DataSync folder,\u00a0then\u00a0watch it automatically update anytime you make a change. No need to hassle with setup or updating. Download Domo Workbench to get started.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nConfiguring a DataSync Folder in Workbench\n\n.\n\n\n SQL DataFlows UI enhancements\n-------------------------------\n\nOur new SQL DataFlows UI\u00a0makes creating, troubleshooting, and editing DataFlows much more efficient. With options like \u201cRun to here\u201d and \u201cRun Preview,\u201d you don\u2019t have to manually click into each transform modal step-by-step in order to then transform later steps. Now\u00a0you can preview, save, and manage settings for your DataFlow from anywhere in the editor.\n\nNotebook and Doc Cards available in Publication Groups\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublication Groups now support Notebook and Doc Cards, helping you to provide better context and understanding for everyone who views your Story both inside and outside your organization. A new \"Cards\" step in the\n **Publication Groups**\n tab of Admin Settings lets you enable access to all Cards, whether or not they are powered by DataSets, and this includes Notebook and Doc Cards (along with custom apps not powered by DataSets).\n\n\n Be aware that this functionality is not turned on by default. If you want to include these Card types in your Publication Groups, you must turn on the setting individually for each Publication Group. Also be aware that Doc Cards in Publication Groups are \"View only,\" meaning content cannot be downloaded from them.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nSetting Up Publication Groups\n\n.\n\n\n New \"Add Card\" modal\n----------------------\n\nThe modal for adding Cards to Domo has been revamped to provide a simplified, less cluttered experience. The initial view now displays the three most common Card types for you to choose from\u2014\n **Visualization**\n (KPI Card),\n **Doc Card**\n , or\n **Notebook**\n . If you select\n **Visualization**\n in this view, you are then prompted to choose whether you want to upload existing data, connect live data, etc. Or, you can choose\n **View More**\n in the initial view to see less-used Card types such as\n **Sumo Table**\n ,\n **Poll**\n , etc.\n\nUndo and redo in Analyzer\n---------------------------\n\nWith the new Undo and Redo buttons in Analyzer, you will have more confidence to explore and try new actions as you build Cards. All actions in Analyzer are available for Undo and Redo, including applying Filters and Chart Properties, making date changes, changing chart types, etc. Keyboard shortcuts for Undo and Redo on\u00a0Mac and Windows are also available (Command + Z/Command + Shift +Z , respectively, on Mac, and Ctrl + Z/Ctrl + Y on Windows).\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAnalyzer Layout\n\n.\n\n\n DomoStats: Mobile\n-------------------\n\nThe addition of the mobile activity DataSet to the DomoStats\u00a0connector adds the ability to measure daily usage of the Domo mobile app within an instance by all users. Being able to better understand how each user is using the Domo platform from both desktop and now mobile unlocks improved decision making and shines light on what content is most important to make business decisions each day.\n\nFor more information about DomoStats\u00a0reports, see\n\nDomoStats Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Mobile widgets\n----------------\n\nAdd your favorite Cards to your phone's home screen as a widget, providing a quick and simple way to see those cards and get \"at a glance\" insights. The widget view shows the visualization, title, and Summary Number for the Card. You can add any type of Card, including custom apps. On iOS, you can add up to 5 Cards to your widget. On Android, you can add multiple widgets and resize them as you want.\n\nCSV attachments on scheduled reports\n--------------------------------------\n\nWhen scheduling a report on a single Card, you can now choose to include an attachment of the data powering the Card. This creates a CSV export of the data and includes it as an attachment. For busy executives and business users, this makes it easy to perform quick, ad-hoc analyses on snapshots of data using the tools of your choice. This also helps you interface seamlessly with customers and colleagues by giving you a way to easily share important data with them on a recurring schedule.\n\nNote that this functionality is only available for Scheduled Reports on individual Cards, not for Dashboards. Also note that the export includes only the data used to power the Card,\n *not*\n the entire DataSet.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nScheduling Reports\n\n.\n\n\n Disabling of Card interactions\n--------------------------------\n\nKeep users on a \"guided path\" in your Domo Stories by disabling interactions on Cards in those Stories. This option is found in the \"Card interaction settings\" for a given card and, when selected, prevents any actions from occurring when a user clicks on the Card. In addition, no buttons or highlighting appear when hovering with the cursor. This gives you the freedom to use text and images as design elements in your Stories without distracting from important content.\n\nAlong with this, a new\n **Card Options button**\n option is also available in the\n **Display Settings**\n menu that appears when you click the\n **Edit Content**\n button for a Card in the Story edit view. When you uncheck this option, the wrench menu does not appear when a user mouses over the Card. This prevents them from taking any actions on the Card, including sharing, exporting, opening the Details view, etc.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCreating Domo Dashboards\n\n.\n\n\n High-Bandwidth Connectors\n---------------------------\n\nMake timely and more relevant data-driven decisions by getting large datasets into\n\nDomo\n\nfaster.\n\nDomo's\n\nsuite of High-Bandwidth Connectors allow you to bring in data 3-6 times faster than the current connectors. These connectors are available for the following systems:\n\n Google\n\nBigQuery\n* Snowflake\n* MySQL\n* Teradata\n* Amazon\n\nRedshift\n* PostgreSQL\n* Oracle\n\n\n Upsert\n\n/partition support in connectors\n---------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate\n\nDataSets\n\nwith restated data to ensure you have the most up-to-date information. Or, select a rolling window of data to keep, making it easier to focus on relevant data.\n\n\n The following connectors have\n\nupsert\n\nsupport:\n\n Shopify\n* Box Advanced\n* Airtable\n\nThe following connectors have partition support:\n\n PostgreSQL\n* MySQL Database\n* MariaDB\n\nDatabase\n* Oracle Database\n* Amazon\n\nRedshift\n* Amazon Aurora\n* Amazon Athena\n* IBM\n\nDB2\n* IBM\n\nInformix\n* Snowflake\n* Vertica\n* Sybase/SAP ASE\n* NetSuite\n\n\n SuiteAnalytics\n\nImproved File Upload connector wizard\n---------------------------------------\n\nWe have added a new File Upload experience in the Data Center, which provides a streamlined process for navigating the steps of the File Upload connector. With just a few clicks (and no page redirect), you can easily upload a CSV, XLS, or XLSX file in no time.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nFile Upload Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Minute granularity\n--------------------\n\nYou can now show your chart data by the minute, so long as your date column includes time data down to the second.\n\nGetting help\n==============\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by clicking\n\nin the top navigation bar.\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://domo.com/university/\n\n.\n* search for training apps in the Appstore\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\nhttps://dojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support by entering a help ticket in the Domo Support Portal or\u00a0by sending a Buzz message to\n\n/support\n\n.\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo (\n **More**\n****> Feedback****\n ).\n\n\n For more information about getting help, see\n\nGetting Help\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360050912013\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004421\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMarch 2020 Release Notes\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,446\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:09 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "march_2020_release_notes", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "release_notes", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamwGAC"}, {"text": "archived_feature_release_notes", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan7GAC"}]}
