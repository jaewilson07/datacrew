 Emma offers web-based email marketing services. Domo's Emma connector allows you to see Emma data in context with your entire organization so you can make real-time adjustments to your automated campaigns that boost not only your open rates, but your business as a whole.  Use Domo's Emma connector to compile reports about mailing groups and members, searches, responses, webhooks, and the like. To learn more about the Emma API, go to

http://api.myemma.com/

.

The Emma connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Emma connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see
