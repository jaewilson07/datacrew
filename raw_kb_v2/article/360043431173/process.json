Domo's Emma connector allows you to see Emma data in context with your entire organization so you can make real-time adjustments to your automated campaigns that boost not only your open rates, but your business as a whole.\u00a0 Use Domo's\u00a0Emma\u00a0connector to\u00a0compile reports about mailing groups and members, searches, responses, webhooks, and the like. To learn\u00a0more about the Emma API, go to\n\nhttp://api.myemma.com/\n\n.\n\nThe Emma connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nThis topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Emma\u00a0connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0Emma\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* Your\u00a0Emma public API key\n* Your\u00a0Emma private API key\n* Your Emma account ID\n\n\n You can find this information in your Emma\n **Account Settings**\n .
