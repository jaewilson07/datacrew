Intro

A Percent of Total chart is a

Bar chart

with a percent scale instead of a value scale—each category bar represents the relative size of its value as a percentage rather than the actual value. Percent of Total charts are essentially Pie charts with bars; however, because no legend is required to match names with categories, these charts are actually easier to read and interpret than Pie-type charts. As with basic Bar charts, both vertical and horizontal versions of Percent of Total charts are available.
