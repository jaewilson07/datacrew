By splitting a large table into smaller and individual tables, queries that access only a fraction of the data can run faster because there is less data to scan.\n                       \n\n                        The main goal of partitioning is to aid in the maintenance of large tables and to reduce the overall response time to read and load the data for specific operations. Partitioning enables faster query execution and distribution of files over multiple storage devices.\n                       \n\n                        This version of Workbench 5.1 Partition Support divides your DataSet into sections based on day, month, or year, and then anytime you add new data from one of those sections, Workbench 5.1 replaces that section with new data.\n                       \n\n                        Setting up partition support in Domo\n                       \n\n                        As you create a new job in Domo Workbench 5.1, you need to specify the Update method as\n                        \n                         Partition\n                        \n                        while configuring the job to set up the partition support for that job.\n                       \n\n                        Creating a job with partition support in Workbench 5.1\n                       \n\n                        You can upload data from external data sources to Domo after specifying connection and data information as a job, which you can save and use again.\n                       \n\n\n                         Creating a DataSet job in Workbench 5.1:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          In the\n                          \n                           DataSet\u00a0Jobs\n                          \n                          pane, click the\n                          \n                           +\n                          \n                          icon to create a new job.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Specify the basic settings for the job, such as the DataSet job name, the method of data transport (such as Local File Provider, ODBC Connection Provider, etc.), the data reader (data source) type (such as JIRA, Excel, etc.), the DataSet name and type, and an optional DataSet description.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Note:\n                              \n                              The DataSet name is the only setting you can change after creating the job.

New columns are added and left unprotected.\n                       \n\n\n                         Block all schema changes\n                        \n\n\n                        If you choose to block all schema changes, you will not see the Protect option for your columns. If you attempt to make changes to any column and run the job, you will receive an error stating about your forceful change. Also, new columns cannot be added.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        How to Prevent Data Corruption when using Partitions:\n                       \n\n                        Any change to the data type of the partition key could result in corrupted data. Please avoid making any changes to the partition key after the DataSet has been created.\n                       \n\n                        How to Troubleshoot when Data has been Corrupted:\n                       \n\n                        If incorrect data is added to your DataSet, you will need to re-run the job with the correct data in the partition that has been affected. Once the job has been re-run with the correct data in the partition you wish to correct, the DataSet will be updated and correct data will be available.\n                       \n\n                        Doing a repair of a full partitioned DataSet is not available with this version of Workbench 5.1 partitions.\n                       \n\n                        FAQ\u2019s\n                       \n\n                        Why is my job failing while executing?\n                       \n\n                        If Domo Workbench 5.1 detects any invalid data in the partition column, it throws an error while executing the job. Also, if your partition columns contain any null values, the job execution fails. Please check for any invalid or null values in your partition columns if you get an error.\n                       \n\n                        Why am I not able to apply partitioning to my previously created jobs?\n                       \n\n                        Domo Workbench 5.1 allows you to apply partitioning to a newly created job. You probably have already specified the update method for your job and run it accordingly. To apply partitioning, you need to create a new job for that DataSet again and select the update method as Partition.\n                       \n\n                        How are nulls handled with Partitions?\n                       \n\n                        If a null appears in the partition key of your partitioned job, the job will error. This happens because Workbench 5.1 cannot create a partition from a null value\n                       \n\n                        Can I do a full repair replace of my partitioned DataSet?\n                       \n\n                        Doing full repair replace of partitioned DataSets is not yet available in this version of Workbench 5.1.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360062446514", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
