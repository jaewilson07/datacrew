This guide will help you prepare and connect your data to the app. The main purpose of the Scheduler app is to allow for a broad variety of scheduling use-cases, as opposed to other offerings in the market which are targeted towards very specific business needs. Follow the steps below to prepare your data for the app and how to set up the app in the Admin set-up section. The app will need to be connected to DataSets output by the Scheduler, as well as the Form Builder app.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        ExternalAppointments\u00a0DataSet\n                       \n\n                        The\n                        \n                         ExternalAppointments\n                        \n                        DataSet, output by the Scheduler app, is a list of end-users that should be allowed to use the app to book a follow-up appointment using their customer ID. This DataSet is not utilized for initial appointments, but even if a Scheduler only offers initial appointments this DataSet mapping should still be configured.

If you have access to the app asset, deploy the asset from the Asset Library to the desired page in Domo. If the app has been deployed for you with sample data, navigate to the app, click on the wrench icon in the top right corner of the app, and select\n                        \n                         Edit Card\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        On the\n                        \n                         Edit Card\n                        \n                        screen, that you will get to from one of the two methods explained above, you can re-name the app at the top of the screen. Scroll down below the app and you should see a series of tabs that represent each of the DataSets the app needs in order to run.
