Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nYou can use the\n **Filter**\n transform to apply filters to a selected column. You can\u00a0choose to have Workbench return matches or non-matches for the specified filter query. You can also include or exclude blank cells in your\u00a0filtered data.\n\nYou can use regular expressions in building filter queries, just as you can when using the\n **Search & Replace**\n filter. Currently no Regular Expression Builder is available for helping you build filters as it is with\n **Search & Replace**\n ; however, you can use all of the same constructions when building filter queries. For more information about the\n **Search & Replace**\n Regular Expression Builder, see\n\nReplacing a Column Value in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n\n**To filter data in Workbench 4,**\n\n. In the\n **Accounts**\n pane, select\u00a0the DataSet job in which you want\u00a0to\u00a0set filters.\n2.
