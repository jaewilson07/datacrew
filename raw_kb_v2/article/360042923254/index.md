Intro
-------

You can move or copy a Card to one or more Pages in Domo from a Card Page or the Details view. When you copy a Card in this way, the copies are linked; any changes made to a copy of a Card are also made to all other copies. This is different from the
 **Save As**
 functionality in that duplicating a Card creates an entirely separate instance of that Card; making a change to a duplicated Card does
 *not*
 affect the original Card. For more information about
 **Save As**
 , see

Duplicating Cards

.

*Notes:**


* When copied, a Card is accessible by users with access to the Page or Card.
* If a Page has been locked, you can only move or copy Cards if you are the Page owner or you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Cards and Pages" enabled. For more information about locking and unlocking content on Pages, see

Managing Custom Roles

.

You can also move or copy multiple Cards at once in the Admin Settings. You must have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Cards and Pages" enabled to use this option.

For more information about default security roles, see

Managing Custom Roles

.
