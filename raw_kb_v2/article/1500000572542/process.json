It helps to manage sales and services, inventory and logistics, marketing, and loyalty, business intelligence practices, and much more across multiple online stores. As a cloud solution, Retail Express gives you the flexibility to manage your business anytime, anywhere, via any internet-enabled devices. Reports and dashboards give users valuable insight into business performance. The Retail Express Web Store API and the IPS API are the web services that allow e-commerce web sites to communicate with Retail Express point of sale and stock control software. This enables the synchronization of products, pricing, purchase orders, customers, internal transfers, and other business-specific information to help reduce the amount of administration required to maintain an online e-commerce website and an IPS. Use Domo's Retail Express connector to retrieve the web store and inventory planning systems data.\n\nThe\n\nRetail Express\n\nConnector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nRetail Express\n\naccount in the Data Center.
