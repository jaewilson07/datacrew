A Multi Radial Progress Gauge is similar to a thermometer that \"fills in\" to show how close the current value is to the goal. This gauge type does not include ranges. A Multi Radial Progress Gauge is similar to a\n                        \n                         progress bar gauge\n                        \n                        except that it is circular and shows an exact value rather than a percentage. Other gauge types in Domo include\n                        \n                         single value gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         radial gauges\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         face gauges\n                        \n                        , and\n                        \n                         comparative fill gauges\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Powering Multi Radial Progress Gauges\n                       \n\n                        A Multi Radial Progress Gauge requires two columns from your DataSet\u2014Item Names that contains the items that will be shown on the chart and the Gauge Value that contains current values. You can also add a third column as the\u00a0Optional Max Value that you intend for your data to achieve. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        If multiple rows are present in your DataSet, the values in all of the rows are aggregated. Be aware that this aggregates the values for the target value column as well. For example, if your spreadsheet included two rows for \"Team A\" that both had a target value of 100, these would be aggregated in your chart to yield a new target value of 200. Selecting\n                        \n                         No Aggregation\n                        \n                        for either the current value or maximum does\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        currently work.\n                       \n\n                        Unless you add a column to the Optional Max Value, the maximum value of a Multi Radial Progress Gauge is automatically determined based on the current value. For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200.\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Multi Radial Progress Gauge.
