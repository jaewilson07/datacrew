Domo offers two SSO solutions: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication and OpenID Connect (OIDC). This article discusses OIDC. For information on authentication using SAML, see our article about\n                        \n                         Understanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On Using SAML\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In Domo, you must have an Admin default security role or a custom role with the\u00a0Manage All Company Settings grant\u00a0enabled to set up SSO.\u00a0For more information about default roles, see\n                        \n                         Managing Custom Roles\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        This article describes using OpenID Connect in Domo in the following categories:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Benefits of OpenID Connect\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Configure OpenID Connect\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Advanced settings\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Benefits of OpenID Connect\n                       \n\n                        Although SAML is the primary SSO protocol for enterprise organizations, many organizations are switching to OIDC because it:\n                       \n\n\n                         works better on mobile devices.\n                        \n\n                         is ideal for external users/non-employees.\n                        \n\n                         is based on OAuth 2, making it a better fit for developers.\n                        \n\n                         is simpler to configure and less expensive to purchase, making SSO accessible to small businesses and enterprises.\n                        \n\n                         is an industry standard supported by identity systems such as Azure Active Directory, Auth0, Google G Suite, Okta, and OneLogin.\n                        \n\n\n                        OIDC is native to some identity providers (IdPs), such as Azure AD. Other IdPs require an integration system, such as Okta, Google, or Ping. You can configure SSO with\n                        \n                         Azure Active Directory\n                        \n                        or any other supported IdP.\n                       \n\n                        SAML and DSO Compatibility\n                       \n\n                        Both SAML and OIDC Connect can run concurrently, making it easy to segment internal and external users. This is also useful for separating the SSO solutions you use for Domo access and Domo Embed. For example, you can use SAML to control employee access to Domo and OIDC to embed maps into other websites and applications.\n                       \n\n                        You can also use Direct Sign-On (DSO) while both SSO methods are in use. To do this, you must configure DSO in\n                        \n                         More\n                        \n                        >\n                        \n                         Admin\n                        \n                        >\n                        \n                         Authentication\n                        \n                        >\n                        \n                         SAML (SSO)\n                        \n                        ,\u00a0even though it applies to both SAML and OIDC. For more information on DSO, see\u00a0our article about\n                        \n                         Understanding and Configuring Domo Single Sign-On Using SAML\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Support Internal and External Users\n                       \n\n                        Enterprises often have employees who are not in their corporate directory but still need access to Domo. It is possible to allow them to sign-in using DSO, but this can be difficult dfor large numbers of users.\n                       \n\n                        A better solution is to use OIDC to implement a second IdP specifically for external users, allowing you to share content with people who are not in your corporate directory. Users who come to Domo without authentication are sent to the SAML IdP by default.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Configure OpenID Connect\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           To configure\u00a0OIDC, you must have an Admin security profile in Domo and have admin access to the IdP.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Configure Using Metadata From Your IdP\n                       \n\n                        If your IdP allows you to use metadata import\u2014almost all IdPs do\u2014you can import your OIDC metadata into Domo.\u00a0This streamlines configuration by automatically setting up most of your settings. Otherwise, you need to manually enter the authentication request endpoint URL, client ID and secret, and other details.\n                       \n\n                        By default, Domo assumes that you want to use metadata for your configuration. This means that you only need to enter the client ID and client secret generated by your IdP, along with the IdP's config URL. The config retrieves all the metadata from the IdP,\u00a0so you don't need to enter any additional information.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Almost all IdPs have well-known configs.
