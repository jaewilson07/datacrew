Intro
-------

The Instagram Business Connector allows you to access Instagram Business Accounts so you can view comments and metadata and get insights and metrics about them. To learn more about the Instagram API, visit their page (

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api

).


 You connect to your Instagram Business account in the Data Center. To successfully connect to Instagram Business, you must first connect your Instagram account to a Facebook page and then grant connector access to your Facebook user. The steps for doing this are described in continuation.


 This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Instagram Business connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To use the Instagram Business connector, you need the following:

 An Instagram Business account. You can use a standard Instagram account, and it will be converted into an Instagram Business account during the setup process.
* A Facebook page URL that will be linked to the Instagram account. Each Facebook page can be connected to ONE Instagram Business account.
* A Facebook administrator user account URL for the page you are linking to Instagram.

*Note:**
 A Facebook user must have a registered Facebook Developer account. To receive the invite, use the Instagram Business Connector. You can do this by selecting following link

https://developers.facebook.com/settings/developer/requests/

and click "Register Now"

Connecting to Your Instagram Business Account
-----------------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Instagram Business Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector.

##

Credentials Pane


 In the
 **Credentials**
 pane, you connect to your Instagram Business account via Facebook. This can only be done once you have 1) c

onnected Instagram to a Facebook page, and 2) e

nabled access for your Facebook user. Steps for accomplishing these tasks are provided in continuation.


 Once you have connected to Instagram Business through Facebook, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Instagram Business DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

 Connecting Instagram to Facebook

To connect your Facebook page to Instagram, follow these instructions:

. Log into Facebook and navigate to the page you want to connect to Instagram.
2. Click on
 **Settings**
 in the top right corner.
3. In the
 **Settings**
 screen, select
 **Instagram**
 in the list on the left, then click
 **Log In**
 in the
 **Manage Instagram on Facebook**
 pane.
4. In the Instagram login screen, enter the username and password of the Instagram account you want to connect to Facebook.


 If the Instagram account is not a business account, you are prompted to switch to a Business profile, as shown here:
5. (Conditional) If the preceding dialog appears, click
 **Continue**
 , then click
 **Done**
 .

Once linking is complete, you will see your Instagram profile's business information in your Facebook page's settings.


####
 Enabling Your Facebook User

Once you have linked your Instagram account to a Facebook Page, you must ask Domo to enable your Facebook user to have access to the connector. This can be done by

contacting Domo Support

and asking for access. You will need to provide the following information:

 The URL of your company Domo instance (e.g.


 mycompany.domo.com


 )
* Your Facebook username. This must be the username of the user who will be using the connector. This is
 *not*
 the name of the Page or Instagram account. You can find your username in the Facebook URL when you go to your Facebook profile:

Once your user has been enabled (which can take up to 5 business days,) you will need to accept the invitation in your Facebook notifications.

 FAQs

###

What do I need to know about connecting via Facebook's OAuth?


**Important**
 : Due to limits of the Facebook API, around every 60 days you will have to re-connect your Facebook account with Domo to avoid unauthorized errors. The easiest way to do this is to navigate to the Accounts tab in the Data Center, search for your Instagram Business account, then click on the wrench icon, and select "Re-connect".

When connecting your Instagram Business account with Domo, a Facebook OAuth process will happen. It's important to correctly configure the OAuth; otherwise, you may miss some of the data (Example: missing Instagram Business data or missing Facebook Pages in the configuration section).


 Below are the basic steps for correctly configuring the OAuth.

. First, choose to "Add account", either from the "Create Instagram Business Connector DataSet" page or from the Accounts view of the connector. For more information about adding an account, see

Managing User Account for Connectors

.
2. If you've never connected Facebook to Domo before, the first screen in the Facebook OAuth will be one of the two screens below. Enter your Facebook credentials (if needed) and continue.

If you are already logged into your Facebook account, Domo will ask if you wish to use the same account for connection.


 3. Now, select the Instagram Business Accounts you want to retrieve data for.

4. Next, select the Facebook Pages that are connected with your Instagram Business accounts.

*Note:**

If you only select the Facebook Pages that aren't connected with a Instagram Business account, the data will be missing. However, there is no harm in selecting extraneous Facebook Pages. This means, if you're unsure which Facebook Page is connected with which Instagram Business account, you can choose "Select All."

5.

Finally, enable all permissions so Domo has access to retrieve your data.


####
 What version of Facebook/Instagram does this connector use?

This connector uses version 15.0 of the Facebook API (

).

####
 What do I need to power up this connector?

To start with, you need a Facebook page, a Facebook account that has a role on that page and an Instagram account. You then need to follow the steps to connect your Instagram account and Facebook page and the steps to enable your Facebook user to have access to the Instagram Business connector. For more information, see

Connecting Instagram to Facebook

.

###
 Do I need any specific kind of Instagram account and Facebook page? Do I need the admin role?

You will be connecting the Facebook page to the Instagram account then converting the account to an Instagram Business account. You don't have to be the admin of the page, but since you'll be connecting it to an Instagram Business Account, the page and account should be related in some way.

###
 How often can the data be updated?

Most information about pages is updated every 24 hours. Selected "insight" metrics are updated roughly every 15 minutes. It is recommended you configure the DataSets to run every 24 hours.

###
 Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?

Instagram Business connector is limited to 200 calls per user per hour.
