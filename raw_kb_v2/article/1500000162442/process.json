JAPAN Corporation\u00a0is a\u00a0Japanese\u00a0internet\u00a0company originally formed as a\u00a0joint venture\u00a0between the\u00a0American\u00a0internet company\u00a0Yahoo!\u00a0(now\u00a0Altaba) and the Japanese company\u00a0SoftBank. Use Domo's Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector to pull data from your Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) system into Domo. To learn more about the Yahoo! JAPAN Marketing Solutions\u00a0API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://biz.marketing.yahoo.co.jp/developercenter-en/program/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Yahoo! JAPAN\u00a0account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Yahoo! JAPAN account and create a DataSet, you must have\u00a0your Yahoo! JAPAN Business ID and password associated with your Yahoo! JAPAN account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Yahoo! JAPAN\u00a0Account\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Yahoo! JAPAN accounts in Domo) to open the Yahoo! JAPAN\u00a0OAuth screen where you can enter your Yahoo! JAPAN credentials. Once you have entered valid Yahoo! JAPAN credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Yahoo! JAPAN\u00a0when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of the Yahoo! JAPAN account that you are logged in.\n\n\n####\n Establishing a new connection:\n\n1. To connect to your Yahoo! JAPAN account through the\u00a0Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN)\u00a0connector, click the\n **Connect**\n button in the connector UI.\n\n2. A Yahoo! JAPAN login window will appear where you need to enter your\n **Yahoo! JAPAN Business ID**\n and\n **Password**\n .\n\n3. Enter your credentials and click\n **Login**\n .\n\n\n 4. Here, you will be asked if you want to approve the access to Yahoo! JAPAN Ads from Domo. Click\n **Approve**\n .\n\n5. Your account will be added successfully. Now, you can click\n **Next**\n and proceed to use the connector\u00a0to pull data from your Yahoo! JAPAN Display Ad Network (YDN) system into Domo.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n ****Reports****\n menu, along with various other menus for configuring your report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Yahoo!
