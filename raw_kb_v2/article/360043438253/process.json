You\u00a0can add, delete, and include descriptions and tags for each managed image. Like the Asset\u00a0Viewer app, you can take a step forward and configure the app\u2019s viewing settings to fit your business use case. Images can also be filtered according to description type or associated tags & they can also be searched for using the search bar option in the tool bar menu. All images placed in the Asset Manager app are placed into App DB and have their own associated dataset in Domo for you to access for other use cases.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Parts of the Asset Manager App\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Default View\n                       \n\n                        The default view in the Image Manager app is configurable using the Configuration\u00a0gear menu.
