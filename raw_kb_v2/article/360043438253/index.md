The Asset Manager app allows you to manage and configure your ad campaign images in one convenient location. You can add, delete, and include descriptions and tags for each managed image. Like the Asset Viewer app, you can take a step forward and configure the app’s viewing settings to fit your business use case. Images can also be filtered according to description type or associated tags & they can also be searched for using the search bar option in the tool bar menu. All images placed in the Asset Manager app are placed into App DB and have their own associated dataset in Domo for you to access for other use cases.
