Intro
-------


 Starting in Workbench 5.1 you can now create a complete backup of your Workbench settings to install on a new computer. This allows you to migrate your settings and accounts exactly as they are from one machine to another. To do this you have to be running Workbench as a local admin on the windows machine.


**Note:**
 Additionally, it's still best practice to back up your jobs separately. The process of backing up your Workbench 5.1 settings does not directly back up individual Workbench 5.1 jobs.


 To learn more about backing up your Workbench jobs, refer to the

Backing Up Workbench 5.1 jobs

article.

Creating a Workbench 5.1 Back Up
----------------------------------


1. Click on the
 **ellipses**
 (More) icon.

 **Settings**

 **Path**
 field, type the file path or click the
 **Browse...**
 button to select a file path.
4. Type the desired name for the .wbf file.
5. Click
 **Save**
 . After youâ€™ve selected where you want to save the backup you can create a passcode used for importing the data into Workbench.
6. In the
 **Passcode**
 field, Type the desired passcode for the .wbf file or, click
 **Generate and copy**
 to have Workbench 5.1 automatically create and copy a passcode for you.

The passcode must be at least 20 characters in length and contain at least 1 uppercase character(s), 1 lowercase character(s), 1 number(s), and 1 symbol(s).
7. Click
 **Create.**
 If done correctly, you will see a message in green saying success. This creates an encrypted .wbf file, a proprietary format that can be used to quickly restore your workbench settings on a new machine.

The backup contains credentials and other potentially sensitive details used in your Workbench Jobs, The passcode is used to decrypt that information upon import back in to workbench, so keep it safe.
