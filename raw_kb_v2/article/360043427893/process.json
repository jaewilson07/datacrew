This allows for ample testing and changes to be made on the staging DataSets while not affecting the production DataSets until you are ready to implement those changes.\n\n\n This would be used for DataFlows that may need editing but you don't want\u00a0the output production data to change until you know the changes made accomplish the intended goals.\n\n\n**To separate staging and production data,**\n\n\n You can\n\ncreate a copy\n\nof your DataFlow. By\u00a0making a DataFlow copy, you also create\u00a0a copy of your output DataSet.\u00a0 This method allows you to make any change\u00a0to the copy DataFlow and not affect your original production DataSet. Also, you can keep\u00a0the original DataFlow on its scheduled update time so users are not without the newest data while you are testing.\n\n\n Once you are happy with the changes made and there are no issues with the output data, you will want to recreate those transforms in your production DataFlow.\u00a0This is the most efficient way of making changes to a DataFlow and with zero interruption of your production DataFlow.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043427893\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004554\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSeparating Staging and Production Data\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,681\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "separating_staging_and_production_data", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "dataflow_management", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanUGAS"}]}
