Most line charts display lines horizontally\u2014that is, you scroll left or right to follow the lines. In these horizontal charts, category data appears on the horizontal axis (x-axis) and value data appears on the vertical axis (y-axis). Domo also includes several vertical line charts, in which you scroll up or down to follow the lines. In vertical line charts, category data appears on the y-axis and value data appears on the x-axis.\n                       \n\n                        Powering line charts\n                       \n\n                        Line charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories (generally dates or times) and one for values. However, you can add series columns to a basic line chart if you want. Adding series data to a line chart may turn it into a\n                        \n                         multi-line chart\n                        \n                        or may simply show the two lines side by side, depending on the data.\n                       \n\n                        For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        There are several different sub-types of basic line charts.

This is useful in situations where you\u00a0want to display\u00a0lines with\u00a0vastly different value increments in the same chart. In the example at right, the left scale shows values in increments of $20,000 and the right scale shows values in increments of 2. Because two scales are present, both lines can be interpreted independently on their own scales. If there was only one scale, the $20,000 increments would be used for both lines, so one of the lines would appear flat.\n                           \n\n                            This property (and\n                            \n                             General >\n                            \n\n                             lines on Left Scale\n                            \n                            ) can only be used in line charts with more than one line.

The right-side chart is being used to measure sales, which are always going to be positive; hence the scale starts at 0. However, the left-side scale is being used to measure profit, which may dip below 0. In this case the scale starts at -2000. Because the scales do not match, the chart is difficult to interpret.\n                           \n\n                            The second example shows the same chart with the zero lines synced.
