When you execute (run) a DataSet, you are essentially doing a refresh of the data in that DataSet. For most connectors, you should not need to do this manually, as you schedule automatic updates as part of the

Data Center

.


 To execute DataSets you do not own, you must have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with the "Manage DataSets" privilege enabled. For more information about default security roles, see

Managing Roles

.


 You can execute DataSets one at a time or in bulk. To take bulk actions on DataSets, you must have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with the "Manage DataSets" privilege enabled.
