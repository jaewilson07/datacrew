You may be wondering why jobs need to be backed up if they\u2019re stored in the Domo cloud. Accidents can happen. Jobs can be accidentally deleted by Workbench users, which will also permanently delete them from the cloud. Further, if the account is accidentally removed from Workbench, all jobs are deleted from the cloud. Exporting your jobs ensures you have a fallback option in the event of a problem.\n\n\n Your exported job files should be stored somewhere safe, as they can contain secure information including API keys, queries, database and/or filenames, etc. Treat them the same as you would passwords or financial information.\n\n\n**To back up jobs in Workbench 5,**\n\n. Open Workbench 5.\n2. Click\n\nin the icon bar.\n3. Click\n **Export**\n in the left-hand navigation pane. (If this pane does not appear when you click\n\n, click\n\nto open it.)\n4. Click\n **Save to**\n ,\u00a0then choose where you want to save your exported jobs on your machine.\n\n*Note:**\n\nIt is NOT recommended that you switch jobs between computers. Please set up new jobs on each computer.\n5. (Optional) If you would job export files to be categorized by Workbench account, check the box that reads\n **Create a new folder for each account**\n .\n6. Check the boxes for all jobs you want to export.\n7. Click\n **Export Jobs**\n .\n\n*To import jobs back into Workbench,**\n\n. Open Workbench 5.\n2. Click\n\nin the icon bar.\n3. Click\n **Import**\n in the left-hand navigation pane. (If this pane does not appear when you click\n\n, click\n\nto open it.)\n4. Under \"Select backup file,\" in the menu,\u00a0select the Workbench account you want the imported jobs to be associated with.\n5. Click\n **Browse**\n then navigate to the files you want to import.\n\n\n All files you select appear in the pane in the\n **Jobs to import**\n area at the bottom of the screen.\n6.
