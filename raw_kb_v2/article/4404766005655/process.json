Benefits of using this connector:\n                       \n\n\n                         The data is collected by blending the Worldometer and Johns Hopkins data to get the most current information. We actually have an alert tracking the updates for information. The data is refreshed roughly every ten minutes and is a blend of current day worldometer with JHU history. If one site is down, we can also toggle quickly between the sources.\n                        \n\n                         The data is cleansed and aligned continuously by fixing inconsistent country names, aligning latitude/longitude or fixing errors, replacing nulls with zero etc. So, the issues are corrected as they are found. As a result, you get the benefit of cleaner and easier to use data.\n                        \n\n                         You always get the enriched data as we have added additional metrics like first date after 100 cases for countries or calculating new cases, deaths, and recoveries for each historical day. We are also now exposing some additional metrics we compile including test results, stay at home orders, economic data and more.\n                        \n\n\n                        How often can the data be updated?\n                       \n\n                        The COVID-19 connector updates automatically as the data updates in the repository.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "4404766005655", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
