Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the result of converging the capabilities of the two existing storage services, Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1.\u00a0Use Domo's Azure Data Lake Gen2 SAS Token Writeback connector to export your data from a Domo dataset to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2 container.\u00a0For more information about Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azu...ta-lake-store/\n\n.\n\n\n You export data to a Azure Data Lake Gen2 in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Gen2\u00a0Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you need\u00a0the following:\n\n Your Microsoft\u00a0Azure Data Lake storage\u00a0account name\n* The Shared Access Signature\u00a0(SAS) Token\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nAzure Data Lake Gen2 SAS Token Writeback\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Azure Data Lake file system (container). The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Name\n  |\n Enter your Microsoft\u00a0Azure Data Lake storage account name.\n  |\n|\n Shared\u00a0Access Signature (SAS) Token\n  |\n Enter the shared access signature token.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account\n\nany time you go to set up a new Domo-Azure\u00a0Data Lake\u00a0Storage Gen2 connection.\n\nYou can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to the selected Azure Data Lake Storage file system (container). You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\u00a0datasources/.\u00a0Example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\u00a0845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n  |\n|\n File System Name\n  |\n Enter the file system name where you wish to upload the file.\u00a0A file system acts as a container for your files.\n  |\n|\n Select Filename\n  |\n Select whether you want to reference your DataSet\u00a0using the\n ****************Input DataSet ID****************\n or an output file name.\n  |\n|\n Filename\n  |\n Enter the output file name for your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360057028134\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004011\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Gen2 SAS Token Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,699\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "microsoft_azure_data_lake_gen2_sas_token_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
