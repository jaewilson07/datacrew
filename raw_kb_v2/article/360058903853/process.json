The service integrates with the Office 365 subscription office productivity suite and features extensions that can integrate with non-Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is a competitor to the\u00a0business communication services\u00a0such as Slack, and is the evolution and upgrade path from Microsoft Skype for Business. Use Domo's\u00a0Microsoft Teams connector to retrieve the details about teams\u00a0and groups\u00a0conversations in your organization.\u00a0To learn more about the Microsoft Teams API, visit\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-concept-overview\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Teams\u00a0account in the Data Center.
