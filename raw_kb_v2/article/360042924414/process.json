Comparative fill gauges\u00a0are similar to\n\nfilled gauges\n\nbut more complex.\u00a0Whereas a filled gauge shows you only the current value, a comparative fill gauge also shows\u00a0the previous value.\u00a0This allows\u00a0viewers\u00a0to see the degree of change since the gauge was last updated. In addition,\u00a0the percentage and direction of change\u00a0appears in the center of the chart.\u00a0You can\u00a0also specify an\u00a0optional\u00a0target value in a comparative fill\u00a0gauge.\n\n\n Comparative fill gauges come in two types: basic and advanced. These are the same except that the advanced type includes additional parameters not available in the basic version. For example, you can create ranges and specify median values. These elements are displayed\u00a0on a second circle in the gauge for a cleaner look.\n\n\n Other gauge types in Domo include\n\nsingle value gauges\n\n,\n\nradial gauges\n\n,\n\nface gauges\n\n, and\n\nprogress bar gauges\n\n.\n\n\n Powering comparative fill gauges\n----------------------------------\n\nA\u00a0basic comparative fill\u00a0gauge requires\u00a0four columns or rows of data from your DataSet. These columns or rows are as follows:\n\n One contains the minimum or lowest value\u00a0that appears on the\u00a0gauge.\n* One contains the maximum or highest value that appears on\u00a0the gauge.\n* One contains the current value for the gauge.\n* One contains the\u00a0previous value for the gauge.\n\nAn advanced comparative fill gauge\u00a0requires all of the above columns, along with the following:\n\n A column with a lower range value.\n* A column with an upper range value.\n* A column with a median value.\n\nWith\u00a0both basic and advanced comparative fill gauges, you can\u00a0also include an optional target value column.\n\n\n The following screenshot points out all of these elements in\u00a0an advanced comparative fill gauge, along with the percentage and direction of change (which is calculated automatically based on your previous and current values):\n\nIf multiple rows are present in your DataSet, only the\n *first*\n row is used. No aggregations occur.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your\u00a0comparative fill\u00a0gauge. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n Customizing comparative fill gauges\n-------------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a comparative fill gauge by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . For information about all chart properties, see\n\nProperties for Gauges\n\n.\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n General > Color Direction\n  |\n Determines whether green fill indicates positive (default) or negative change in the gauge. When\u00a0positive change is denoted by green, negative change is denoted by red. Alternatively,\u00a0if you\u00a0specify that negative change is denoted by green, then positive\u00a0change is denoted by red.\n\n\n In the example at right, the user has selected\n **Negative is Green**\n for this property. Thus, because the percent change is positive, the color fill is red.\n  |  |\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042924414\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004728\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nComparative Fill Gauge\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,032\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:26 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "comparative_fill_gauge", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
