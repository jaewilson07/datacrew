You can\u00a0use\u00a0Domo's\n\nData.gov\n\nconnector to\u00a0compile reports containing freely available government data.\u00a0To learn more about the\n\nData.gov\n\nAPI, visit their\u00a0page (\n\nhttps://www.data.gov/developers/apis/\n\n).\n\n\n The\n\nData.gov\n\nconnector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nData.gov\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nData.gov\n\nconnector user interface. General information for adding data sources, setting update schedules, and editing data source information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nBecause\n\nData.gov\n\ndata is freely available, you do not need to create an account in Domo to access it. Hence, you do not need to\u00a0enter credentials in the\n\nData.gov\n\nconnector page. However, there are many report types\u00a0that require you to enter a\n\nData.gov\n\nAPI key. You can\u00a0obtain a free API key by\u00a0going to\n\nhttps://api.data.gov/signup/\n\nand entering your first name, last name, and email address. The API key then appears on the screen. You can copy and paste this key as necessary in the Domo\n\nData.gov\n\nconnector interface.\n\n\n Creating a\n\nData.gov\n\nreport\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Details**\n pane in the\n\nData.gov\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your Data Source**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The\u00a0Details\u00a0pane contains\u00a0a primary menu,\n **Report**\n , along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\nMenu\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nReport\n\n|\n\nSelect a\n\nData.gov\n\nreport.
