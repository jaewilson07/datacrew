Intro
-------

Slideshows are an excellent way to showcase your company data. You may find them useful in any of the following situations:

 Wallboards


 You can view vital data about the progress of your team on a wallboard or large monitor.
* Business presentations


 As the presenter, you can pause the Slideshow on slides you want to discuss in more detail, then continue the presentation when you are ready.
* Company kiosks


 You can play a Slideshow on a monitor to showcase what your company is doing.
* Departmental monitors


 You can play a Slideshow of Cards that pertain to a department. For example, your sales team could view a Slideshow of Cards for the number of sales made the last week, quarter, etc.

Slideshows in Domo come in two varieties:

 Domo Publications


 Publications place your content into a Slideshow that can either be exported to other formats, or securely published to the web.
* One-time Page Slideshows


 These are simple Slideshows of all of the Cards in a Page. They are unsaved—you simply select the
 **View Page as Slideshow**
 option for a Page and the Slideshow plays.

You can view your Slideshow in "kiosk" mode on a wallboard, TV, or large monitor in a Web browser by signing in to Domo and playing the Slideshow.


**Note:**
 If you cannot see labels on Cards in your Slideshows, this may be because of resolution limitations when sizing the window. If you run into this problem, try resizing your windows to fit the labels then refreshing your screen.

 Creating and Managing Publications
-------------------------------------

In the Publications Page you can create and manage "Publications"—Slideshows of Cards in Domo.


 Publications let others view the slides outside of Domo. When you publish a Publication, Domo creates a URL for accessing the Publication on the Web. You can send an email containing the URL link to others, inviting them to view the Publication. You can require an access code for viewing a Publication by publishing the Publication privately.


 You can also schedule reports to be sent at specified intervals to users and groups in your organization.

*Note**
 : Domo Publications stay synced to the Cards they contain—that is, when data in a Card changes, that Card is instantly updated in the Slideshow to reflect the changes. If you would prefer to have a one-time, unchanging snapshot of Card data in your Slideshow, you can export a Publication as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. For more information, see

Exporting KPI Cards

.

For information about the layout of the Publications Page, see

Publications Page Layout

.

##
 Creating a Publication

There are two ways to create Publications in Domo:

 Selecting the
 **Create New Slideshow**
 option in the Publications Page then adding each Card you want in the Slideshow one by one.
* Selecting the
 **Publish as Slideshow**
 option in a Card Page. This creates a Slideshow from all of the Cards in this Page. You can then add Cards from other Pages if you want to.

*To create a Publication by adding individual Cards,**

. Select
 **More > Publications**

 Cards in your Slideshow appear in the same order as the Cards in this dialog.


**Note:**
 If you add Cards with Analyzer-filtered data to a Slideshow, the filtered version is the one that appears in the Slideshow. Likewise, if you add a Card to a Slideshow in which the data is filtered due to PDP policies, the filtered version appears in the Slideshow. This is the version
 *all*
 users see when they view the published Slideshow, regardless of their permissions.

 Exporting Publications
------------------------

You can export slides of KPI Cards from a Publication as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. Exporting may be useful when you want to present a
 *snapshot*
 of your data (as opposed to a dynamic Slideshow that updates when Card data is updated).


 The following table lists the major similarities and differences between exported Publications and those viewed in Domo:


 In PowerPoint...
  |
 In Domo
  |
| --- | --- |
| * Each Card appears as a slide
* Cards are

Viewing a one-time Slideshow of Cards on a Page
-------------------------------------------------

You can view Cards on a Page as a one-time (i.e. unsaved) Slideshow.


 Because Page Slideshows show all Cards on a Page, you may want to create Pages designed specifically for Slideshows. For example, each project team in your Development department might have its own Page, and you want to showcase the progress made by each team in resolving software bugs. You could create a new Page containing those Cards from each Page that show this data, then play a Slideshow for the new Page.

*Notes:**


* Playing a Slideshow of Cards on a Page is a quick way to review Cards on a Page but the Slideshow is
 *not*
 saved.


 If you want to create and save a Slideshow of Cards on a Page that others can view at their convenience, the following options are available:


	+ You can create a dynamic Slideshow by clicking

 in the upper right area of the Page, selecting
	 **Publish as Slideshow**
	 , then clicking
	 **Save**
	 . This saves the Slideshow to your Domo instance. From here, you can download, play, publish, edit, or delete the Slideshow. For more information, see

 Creating and Managing Publications

 .
	+ You can export a Page of Cards directly to PowerPoint by selecting
	 **Export to PowerPoint**
	 from the Page

 menu. In this case, no Slideshow is saved to Domo, and the data does not update dynamically. However, this is an excellent way to create a shareable snapshot of data quickly. For more information, see

 Exporting KPI Cards

 .
* From the Launcher Page, you can view Cards powered by a specific connector or data provider as a Slideshow. For more information, see

Viewing Cards for Data Providers

.
* Notebook Cards are not currently supported using this Slideshow method.

*To play a Slideshow of all of the Cards on a Page,**

. Navigate to the Page with Cards you want to show.
2. Click

located in the upper right area of the Page.
3. Select
 **View Page as Slideshow**
 .

For information about the controls in the Slideshow viewer, see the next section.


 Using the Slideshow viewer
----------------------------

Domo contains a built-in Slideshow viewer that is used for presenting Cards one by one in full-screen mode. In the viewer, you have access to basic controls, including the ability to pause the Slideshow, skip to the next slide or backtrack to a previous slide, or specify the amount of time that slides remain on the screen.


 The main controls in the Slideshow interface appear temporarily in the top right corner of the screen when you move the mouse. There are also other controls that appear in other parts of the screen when you hover in those areas. All of these are described in continuation.

##
 Main controls

The Slideshow feature in Domo has a main set of controls you can use to navigate through the slides, pause and play, specify the time between slides, and open a full-screen view. The controls appear in the top right corner of the screen when you start the Slideshow. These disappear after a few seconds but you can make them reappear by moving the mouse. These controls include the following:


 Control
  |

###
 Previous/next arrows

When you hover near the left or right side of the screen, large arrows appear that take you to the previous or next slide when clicked. These arrows are similar to the arrows in the main set of controls. You may find these arrows more useful in navigating through slides.

##
 Card carousel

When you hover near the bottom of the screen, a row of Cards pops up—click a Card to jump to that Card in the Slideshow. If there are more than eight Cards in the Page, you can use the

and

arrows to "slide" the Card carousel left or right to show more Cards. If the arrows are dimmed, there are no more Cards on the Page in the direction indicated.
