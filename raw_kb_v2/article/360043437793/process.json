You may find them useful in any of the following situations:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Wallboards\n                          \n                          You can view vital data about the progress of your team on a wallboard or large monitor.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Business presentations\n                          \n                          As the presenter, you can pause the Slideshow on slides you want to discuss in more detail, then continue the presentation when you are ready.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Company kiosks\n                          \n                          You can play a Slideshow on a monitor to showcase what your company is doing.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Departmental monitors\n                          \n                          You can play a Slideshow of Cards that pertain to a department. For example, your sales team could view a Slideshow of Cards for the number of sales made the last week, quarter, etc.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Slideshows in Domo come in two varieties:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Domo Publications\n                          \n                          Publications place your content into a Slideshow that can either be exported to other formats, or securely published to the web.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          One-time Page Slideshows\n                          \n                          These are simple Slideshows of all of the Cards in a Page.

When you publish a Publication, Domo creates a URL for accessing the Publication on the Web. You can send an email containing the URL link to others, inviting them to view the Publication.

If you would prefer to have a one-time, unchanging snapshot of Card data in your Slideshow, you can export a Publication as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.
