In addition to allowing you to power up pre-installed best practice dashboards as described in

Powering Up Business-in-a-Box Dashboards

, Business-in-a-Box also lets you do the following:

 Link card pages from your Domo instance to a given department tab.
* Add apps from the Appstore.

When you add card pages or Appstore dashboards to a department tab, they appear in the list of dashboards for that tab, providing quick and easy navigation for users with a given role. For example, Domo user Judy is over YouTube marketing campaigns for her company. In addition to the pre-installed Business-in-a-Box dashboards available in the Business-in-a-Box "Marketing" tab, she also regularly refers to another card page in Domo called "YouTube Marketing." Instead of having to constantly switch between Business-in-a-Box and the "YouTube Marketing" page, Judy can simplify her navigation by linking "YouTube Marketing" to the "Marketing" tab in Business in a Box. She can then access all her marketing dashboards from one place.
