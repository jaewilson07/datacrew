For example, Domo user Judy is over YouTube\u00a0marketing campaigns for her company. In addition to the pre-installed Business-in-a-Box dashboards available in the Business-in-a-Box \"Marketing\" tab, she also regularly refers to another card page in Domo\u00a0called \"YouTube Marketing.\" Instead of having to constantly switch between Business-in-a-Box and the \"YouTube Marketing\" page, Judy can simplify her navigation by linking \"YouTube Marketing\" to the \"Marketing\" tab in Business in a Box. She can then access all her marketing dashboards from one place.\n                       \n\n                        You can\n                        \n                         only\n
