However, the left-side scale is being used to measure profit, which may dip below 0. In this case, the scale starts at -2000.

If you change this value, the first bar is divided into the indicated number of series, and the second bar is adjusted accordingly. For example, if a category contained three series, by default the first bar would contain one series and the second would contain the other two.
