You can get several details about your Microsoft email data into Domo easily and securely. To do this, you must first create an app in Microsoft Azure. You must have an Admin account or an Admin approval to connect to your Microsoft account.\u00a0Use Domo's Microsoft Report connector to get data about the email and user activities from your Microsoft account into Domo.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Reports account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Reports connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n An installed Microsoft Azure app.\n* The client ID for your Azure app.\n* The client secret for your Azure app. This is generated when you create your Azure app.\n\n\n#####\n**To find the Client ID, do the following:**\n\n\n1. Go to\n\nhttps://portal.azure.com\n\nand sign in using your Microsoft credentials.\n2. Select\n ****Azure Active Directory > App registrations****\n .\n3. Find your app and click on it.\n4. Locate the \"Application ID\" from the web app (this is the client ID).\n\n\n#####\n**To generate a new Client Secret, do the following:**\n\n\n1. Go to\n\nhttps://portal.azure.com\n\nand sign in using your Microsoft credentials.\n2. Select\n ****Azure Active Directory > App registrations****\n .\n3. Find your app and click on it.\n4. Open\n ****Certificates and secrets****\n .\n5. Create the client secret.\n\n\n###\n Creating an Azure App\u00a0for Enterprise OAuth\n\nTo create a Microsoft Azure app, do the following:\n\n\n 1.

Also, can be referred to as public keys.\n\n7. Click on\n **+ New Client Secret**\n button.\n\n8.\u00a0Specify the client secret description and the expiry period for your client secret, and click\n ****Add****\n .\n\n9. Copy the value and paste it into the\n ****Client Secret****\n field in the Connector credentials section in Domo.\n\n\n 10. Now, click\n **API Permissions**\n .\n\n11.
