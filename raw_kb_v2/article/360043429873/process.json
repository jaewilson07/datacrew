In addition to being able to search by name, you can also apply various filters to your search.

You can choose any of these filters then specify the criteria for the filter. For example, if you chose\n                              \n                               Tag\n                              \n                              , you would then be prompted to select the tag associated with your desired DataSet. You can also customize filters by applying operators. These differ between filters. Most filters include the\n                              \n                               Not\n                              \n                              operator so you can indicate that specified criteria are excluded from your filter. For example, you might build a filter in which the status is\n                              \n                               not\n                              \n                              disabled. Date-based filters include the\n                              \n                               On\n                              \n                              ,\n                              \n                               Not On\n                              \n                              ,\n                              \n                               Before\n                              \n                              , and\n                              \n                               After\n                              \n                              operators so you can narrow down when when a DataSet was created or last run.
