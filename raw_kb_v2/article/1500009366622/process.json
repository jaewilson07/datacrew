This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Cornerstone OnDemand connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Cornerstone OnDemand account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A valid username associated with an active account in the portal.\n* The client assigned hostname for your Cornerstone OnDemand\u00a0application (Corpname).\n* The API Key and API Secret.\u00a0It can be retrieved from the Manage API tab in Integration Center.\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nCornerstone OnDemand\n\nAccount\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nCornerstone OnDemand\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nCornerstone OnDemand\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0valid username associated with an active account in the portal.\n  |\n|\n Coprname\n  |\n Enter the client assigned hostname for your CornerStone OnDemand\u00a0application (Corpname).\n  |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter the API Key.\u00a0It can be retrieved from the Manage API tab in Integration Center.\n  |\n|\n API Secret\n  |\n Enter the API Secret.\u00a0It can be retrieved from the Manage API tab in Integration Center.\n  |\n|\n Environment\n  |\n Select the environment (Pilot, Stage, or Production).\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\n\nCornerstone OnDemand\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nCornerstone OnDemand\n\nDataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Views\n  |\n Select a view from the dropdown.\u00a0The\u00a0views that are accessible to you are dependent on your access level.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the Connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n What endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\n\nThe base URL for Cornerstone OnDemand varies per your environment selection.\n\n\n Environment\n  |\n Base URL\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Pilot\n  |\n https://{\n\ncorpname}-\n\npilot.csod.com/services/api/x/odata/api\n  |\n|\n Stage\n  |\n https://{\n\ncorpname}-\n\nstg.csod.com/services/api/x/odata/api\n  |\n|\n Production\n  |\n https://{\n\ncorpname}.\n\ncsod.com/services/api/x/odata/api\n  |\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the username, corp name, API key, and API secret associated with your Cornerstone OnDemand account. You can get your API key and API secret from the Manage API tab in Integration Center. You also need to select the environment (Pilot, Stage, or Production).\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNone\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500009366622\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003227\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCornerstone OnDemand Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,688\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "cornerstone_ondemand_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
