Cornerstone OnDemand helps organizations recruit, train, engage, and manage their employees. Cornerstone also helps people be their best at work with the right development and experiences.

The Cornerstone OnDemand connector allows you to pull data from your Cornerstone OnDemand system into Domo. To learn more about the Cornerstone OnDemand API, visit their page (

 You connect to your Cornerstone OnDemand account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Cornerstone OnDemand connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
