You also have the option to build your public website directly on Domo instead of having to find another hosting provider.\n\n\n Simply publish an index.html file as a public asset and you will then have a public-facing website for your Domo app. Creating public assets is as simple as adding a new folder to your custom Domo app project called \"public-assets\". Any file that exists within the \"public-assets\" folder, when published up to your Domo instance and instantiated as a card, will now be available to the public.\u00a0The URL for your public asset will be the same URL that you find as the `src` for the iframe that hosts your Domo app as a card in your instance.\n\n\n For more information on the Public Domo App Assets, see\n\nhttps://www.developer.domo.com\n\n.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360057087073\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004625\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPublic Domo App Assets\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,701\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "public_domo_app_assets", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "using_domo_apis", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan1GAC"}, {"text": "developer_topics", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanYGAS"}]}
