You also have the option to build your public website directly on Domo instead of having to find another hosting provider.\n                       \n\n                        Simply publish an index.html file as a public asset and you will then have a public-facing website for your Domo app. Creating public assets is as simple as adding a new folder to your custom Domo app project called \"public-assets\". Any file that exists within the \"public-assets\" folder, when published up to your Domo instance and instantiated as a card, will now be available to the public.\u00a0The URL for your public asset will be the same URL that you find as the `src` for the iframe that hosts your Domo app as a card in your instance.\n                       \n\n                        For more information on the Public Domo App Assets, see\n                        \n                         https://www.developer.domo.com\n                        \n                        .", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360057087073", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
