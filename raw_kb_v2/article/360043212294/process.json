You can select a basic update frequency (once per day, once per week, etc.) or configure advanced scheduling options (such as setting an exact time, choosing specific days of the week or month, or setting update intervals within a specific daily timeframe). Or, if the data source is a local file,\u00a0you can have Workbench run the job\u00a0anytime the source file is updated.\n                       \n\n                        For more information about the schedule job settings, see\n                        \n                         Understanding the Workbench 5\u00a0User Interface.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Important:\n                           \n                           When running on a schedule, Workbench uses the local system account to access the file.
