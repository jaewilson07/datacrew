Use this connector to pull data files from your Data Lake Store into Domo. You can retrieve data files in any of the following file types: CSV, XLS, XLSX and JSON. For more information about Azure's API, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azu...ta-lake-store/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store tenant ID\n* Your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store client ID\n* Your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store client secret\n\nTo obtain credentials, please reach out to your Microsoft account representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Account\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Tenant ID\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store tenant ID.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store client ID.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store client secret.\n  |\n|\n Account FQDN\n  |\n Enter the fully-qualified domain name of your Azure Data Lake Store account. For example:\n\n\n mycompany.azuredatalakestore.net\n\n\n |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n ACL Status\n  |\n Returns the ACL status for a given file or directory.\n  |\n|\n Content Summary\n  |\n Returns a content summary for a given file or directory.\n  |\n|\n Directory/File Information\n  |\n Retrieves the metadata for a given file or directory.\n  |\n|\n Download File\n  |\n Imports the content of a selected file into a Domo DataSet.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Directory Path\n  |\n Enter the directory path of the file you want to import into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Path\n  |\n Enter the complete path of the file or directory you want to retrieve information for.
