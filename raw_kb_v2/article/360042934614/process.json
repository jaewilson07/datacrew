These policies allow you to filter data in DataSets\u00a0for specified users and groups. Those users and groups then see only the data pertinent to them when viewing KPI and Sumo cards with PDP policies applied.\n                       \n\n                        For example, you might have a card showing a map with data for two regions in the U.S\u2014West and East.\u00a0You could create two PDP policies\u2014one for the \"West\" region and one for the \"East\" region. For the \"West\" policy you would select those salespeople\u00a0working in the West region, and for the \"East\" policy you would select those salespeople working in the East region. If Larry, a salesperson based in Washington, then opened the card, he would see data\n                        \n                         only\n                        \n                        for\u00a0the states in the West region\u2014all states in the East region would appear with no data.\n                       \n\n                        When creating PDP policies, you can use any of the following filters:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Simple filter\n                          \n                          . This allows you to build policies based on specific\u00a0column values. For example, you could build a policy for the \"West\" region and one for the \"East\" region, as illustrated above.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Custom filter\n                          \n                          . This allows you to customize a filter to use in your policy. A variety of rules is available.\u00a0You can use \"greater than\" and \"less than\" rules to base a filter around a specific threshold, or you can use a\u00a0\"between\" rule to build a filter around a range of values or dates. You can also apply a \"begins with\" rule to filter on strings.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Filter by user or group\u00a0attribute\n                          \n                          . This allows you to build dynamic PDP filters based on attributes for a user or group such as name, email, or employee number.\u00a0In the Domo navigation header, go to\n                          \n                           More >\n                          \n\n                           Admin > Governance > Attributes\n                          \n                          . Here you can check attributes that should be available for use in PDP. For\u00a0information about enabling or disabling\u00a0user attributes, see the heading for\n                          \n                           Enabling or Disabling Attributes for Dynamic PDP Policies\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        PDP policies are also applied in other tools\u00a0in Domo, such as alerts and DataFusions. When you are subscribed to an alert on a card powered by a PDP DataSet, the alert is customized to reflect the PDP policies in place. When you build a DataFusion\u00a0from one or more input DataSets with PDP policies in place, those policies are incorporated into the output DataSet.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video\u00a0- Dynamic Personalized Data Permissions (PDP)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating PDP\u00a0Policies\n                       \n\n                        You create and manage PDP policies in the Data Center.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) Policy Creation\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         To create a PDP policy,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Data\n                          \n                          in the toolbar at the top of the screen.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                          in the left-hand navigation pane.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Locate and click the DataSet you want to apply a policy to.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click the\n                          \n                           PDP\n                          \n                          tab.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Click the\n                          \n                           Impact\n                          \n                          button to open a list of cards and alerts that will be affected by PDP policies on this DataSet.\n                          \n                          Though this is not required, it is highly recommend that you review this list before proceeding.

Instead of selecting individual values in specific columns to pertain to specific users or groups, you select a column and\u00a0a user attribute. Domo\u00a0then automatically allows people to see only those rows that match that user attribute. For example, you could create an attribute-defined PDP policy based on a user's email address. Then, if a user opened a card with this PDP policy applied, Domo would only show data corresponding to those rows containing the user's email address.\n                       \n\n                        To prevent security breaches, user attributes\n                        \n                         must\n                        \n                        be locked in Admin Settings before they can be used in PDP policies. This can be done only by users with Admin security privileges. Locked attributes can only be unlocked by Admin users and only when they are not being used in any PDP policies. For example, if a user creates a PDP policy that filters on the\n                        \n                         Employee number\n                        \n                        attribute, and an Admin user then goes into\n                        \n                         Admin Settings\n                        \n                        to unlock that attribute, he would not be able to do so.

Suppose the company \"Kablinko\u00a0Electronics\" keeps track of sales throughout the U.S. using a DataSet\u00a0in which sales are broken down by region\u2014\"East\" and \"West.\" The data is presented using a U.S. map. By default, no PDP policies are in place, so all data in the DataSet appears, as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        The head of a Sales department wants to ensure that salespeople in each region see only the data that pertains to them. All salespeople belong to one of four groups\u2014\"Kablinko East,\"\u00a0\"Kablinko West,\" \"Kablinko South,\" and \"Kablinko Central\"\u2014so this is a simple matter of connecting each group to a policy filtered to the appropriate region.\n                       \n\n                        The department goes into the Data Center, locates the pertinent DataSet, and clicks\n                        \n                         PDP\n                        \n                        to open the PDP tab for the DataSet. They enter a policy name\u2014\"East Region\"\u2014then select\n                        \n                         Add Data\n                        \n                        to open the\n                        \n                         Add Data Access\n                        \n                        dialog.

Finally they select the \"Kablinko East\" group in the\n                        \n                         Add Groups & People\n                        \n                        dialog\u00a0and save the new policy. They then repeat the same steps for a \"West Region\" policy, selecting \"West\" as the value and \"Kablinko West\" as the group. They do not create a policy for \"Kablinko Central\" or \"Kablinko South\"\u00a0yet.\n                        \n\n                        Ross'\n                        \n                         PDP\n                        \n                        tab for the DataSet now appears as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Now that the policies are in place, users from the three groups see the data in the map differently depending on their group's policy.
