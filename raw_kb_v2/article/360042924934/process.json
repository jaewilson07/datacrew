A Radial gauge is similar in appearance to a speedometer in a car, with a \"needle\" that moves to indicate the proximity of the current value to the goal. Radial gauges can include up to six ranges.

This creates a \"bare-bones\" Radial gauge without ranges. You can specify up to six different ranges in a Radial gauge in\n                        \n                         Chart Properties\n                        \n                        .

For example, if your current value was 80, the maximum value would be set to 100. If the current value was 155, the maximum value would be set to 200. However, you can set custom minimum and maximum values by specifying ranges. The minimum value of your first range is the minimum value of the gauge, and the maximum value of your last range is the maximum value of the gauge.\n                       \n\n                        By default, all of the values in your values column are summed to produce the final value for the chart, even when you select\n                        \n                         No Aggregation\n                        \n                        in the value aggregation menu.
