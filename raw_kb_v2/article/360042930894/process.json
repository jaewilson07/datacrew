In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0NOAA Weather connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nNone\n\n\n Creating an NOAA Weather DataSet\n----------------------------------\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\n\n####\n Report\n\nThere are two types of reports to choose from:\n\n. The\n **Forecast**\n report returns future forecast weather data at either a daily or hourly period.\n2. The\n **Current Observations**\n report returns 1 row of the last recorded values\u00a0for a specific weather station.\n\n\n####\n Latitude and Longitude\n\nProvide the latitude and longitude for the coordinates you would like to return data for.\n\n\n**Tip:**\n These fields will only handle positive and negative numbers. Adding an N at the end of your latitude will case an error. (Ex: 40.3452 N)\n\n###\n Weather Station\n\nYou must select a weather station when choosing the current observations report. The weather station drop-down list is populated with the closest stations to the latitude and longitude provided.\n\n##\n Other Panes\n\nThen, schedule updates for your new DataSet in the\n **Scheduling**\n pane. For information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930894\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003371\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNOAA Weather Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,651\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "noaa_weather_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
