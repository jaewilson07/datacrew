Intro
-------

Magento is an open-source content management system for e-commerce websites. Use Domo's Magento connector to retrieve data about customers, orders, and products. To learn more about the Magento REST API, visit their page (

https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v...arted-api.html

).


 You connect to your Magento account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Magento connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Magento account and create a DataSet, you need the username and password of your Magento account.


 SSL is required for this connector to work.
