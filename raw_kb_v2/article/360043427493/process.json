Prioritization of backlog items is based on a number of factors, including the perceived value that the enhancement would provide to a customer, and how many of our customers would likely utilize the added value. We do our best to be fair and give priority to items that will provide the greatest value to the greatest number of our customers.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                          If you would like to submit an Enhancement Request to Domo, you can do so by selecting\n                          \n                           Feedback\n                          \n                          in the\n                          \n                           More\n                          \n                          menu and entering your request.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Why aren't my output DataSets from a DataFlow appearing as updated after I run the DataFlow?\n                       \n\n\n                         This is usually because the data has not actually changed\u2014no update has occurred.
