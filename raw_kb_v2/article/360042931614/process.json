Simply input your own SSH credentials and write a query to pull the data you need, and ready to go. For more information about the\u00a0Redshift API, visit their website.

To grant other users access, you must create one or more user accounts. Database user accounts are global across all the databases in a cluster; they do not belong to individual databases.\n                        \n\n                        Use the\n                        \n                         CREATE USER\n                        \n                        command to create a new database user. When you create a new user, you specify the name of the new user and a password. A password is required. It must have between 8 and 64 characters, and it must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeral.\n                        \n\n                        For example, to create a user named GUEST with password ABCd4321, issue the following command:\n                        \n\n\n                         create user guest password 'ABCd4321';\n                        \n\n\n                        Whitelisting IP addresses\n                       \n\n                        Before you can connect to a Redshift database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to.
