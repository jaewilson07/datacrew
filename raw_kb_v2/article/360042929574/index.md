Intro
-------

Intercom is a platform used to integrate customer messaging apps for sales, marketing and support connected on one platform. To learn more about the Intercom API, visit their page (

https://developers.intercom.com/inte...ence/reference

).


 You connect to your Intercom account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intercom connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Intercom account and create a DataSet, you must have an Intercom access token. For information about obtaining an access token, see

https://developers.intercom.com/docs...-access-tokens

. Note that some reports require your access token to have "extended scope."

 This section enumerates the options in the

 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 FAQs
------


#####
 How often can the data be updated?

DataSets can be updated as often as once an hour, though this should be decreased if rate limits are encountered.

####
 Are there any API rate limits I should be aware of?

Intercom allows 83 calls per 10 seconds or roughly 500 per minute.

####
 What kind of credentials do I need to power this connector?

Intercom requires an access token to authenticate. Be aware that some reports require that your access token include "extended access" to work. If you receive an authentication error and your key is valid, check with your Intercom administrator to get "extended access" added to your API key.
