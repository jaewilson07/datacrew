To learn more about the Facebook API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis\n\n).\n\n\n This Advanced version of the Facebook Ads connector allows you to access more reports than the standard Facebook Ads connector but also requires more configuration. For information about the simplified version, see\n\nFacebook Ads Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Facebook account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Facebook Ads connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Tracking how many people view individual ads\n* Tracking how many people are reached by each campaign\n* Tracking how much money has been spent on campaigns\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Reach\n* Spend\n* Cost per Lead\n* Leads generated\n* Impressions\n* Clicks\n* Cost per Click\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Online marketers\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 1-2 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* The Facebook Ads connector provides ready-made reports that you can use right away. The \"Custom Insights\" report is the most flexible report in this connector. It allows you the most control over the reports you generate.\n* This connector can take a long time to run if the date range is very long and/or the account selected has a large number of campaigns or ads. The long run time occurs because Facebook is taking a long time to calculate the selected metrics. If the DataSet is taking too long or doesn't complete, the date range needs to be smaller.\n* Metrics for ads placed through Instagram can be found by using the \"Custom Insights\" report and setting the\n **Breakdown**\n value to\n **Placement**\n . Instagram is then listed as one of the placement values in the results.\n* You can also return metrics for Instagram video views. This is discussed later in this article, under\n\nInstagram Video Views\n\n.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to Facebook and create a Facebook Ads DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address associated with your Facebook account, or your telephone number\n* Your Facebook password\n* Access to your company's Facebook Ads account\n\nConnecting to Your Facebook Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n\nCredentials\n\nand\n\nDetails\n\npanes in the Facebook Ads Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Facebook Ads connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Facebook Ads accounts in Domo) to open the Facebook OAuth screen where you can enter your Facebook credentials. Once you have entered valid Facebook credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Facebook Ads DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Facebook when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Facebook.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Many report types include a number of sub-reports called \"edges.\" These are also described below.\n\n###\n Reports and Edges\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Facebook Ads report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Ad Accounts\n  |\n Returns information about one or more selected Facebook Ads Accounts.\n  |\n|\n Ad Campaigns\n  |\n Returns information about one or more Ad Campaigns controlled by the selected\n\n\n**Account(s)**\n .\n  |\n|\n Ad Keyword Statistics (Deprecated)\n  |\n Returns information about the Keywords used for targeting the selected\n\n\n**Ad(s)**\n .\n  |\n|\n Ad Sets\n  |\n Returns information about one or more Ad Sets within the selected\n\n\n**Ad Campaign(s)**\n .\n  |\n|\n Ads\n  |\n Returns information about one or more Ads defined in the selected\n\n\n**Ad Set(s)**\n .\n  |\n|\n Custom Insights\n  |\n Returns user-selected insight information at a reporting level defined by the\n\n\n**Level**\n\n\n field.\n  |\n|\n General Metrics\n  |\n Returns commonly-used insight metrics at the Campaign level.\n  |\n|\n Object Information - NEW\n  |\n This new report enables you to retrieve the Info edge of the all the Account, Campaign, Ad set, or Ad objects associated with the Ad Accounts you select.

However, figuring out how to map between the column names shown in the Facebook Ads UI and the list of available columns/categories can be tricky. The following steps can help:\n\n. In the Facebook Ads UI, open the report that you want to duplicate in Domo.\n2. Select\n **Columns > Customize Columns**\n .\n\n\n A dialog box opens that lets you choose and reorder columns in the report.\n3. Pick a column to add to the report and click\n **Apply**\n .\n\n\n If you look at the URL, you\u2019ll see a parameter called \"columns.\" This will look something like the following:\n\ncolumns=[\"name\"%2C\"date\\_start\"%2C\"date\\_stop\"%2C\"reach\"%2C\"frequency\"%2C\"impressions\"%2C\"cpm\"%2C\"cpp\"%2C\"spend\"%2C\"clicks\"%2C\"unique\\_clicks\"%2C\"ctr\"%2C\"unique\\_ctr\"%2C\"cpc\"%2C\"actions%3Aoffsite\\_conversion.lead\"%2C\"social\\_reach\"]\n\nEach of the items between quotes is a column, and this is the API name for it. The names that are shown in the\n **Columns**\n field are typically close (or identical) to these names.\n\nThe tricky columns are ones that are actually part of a bigger category in the Domo UI. This includes columns like \"Actions,\" which expands into several smaller fields, including\n\nactions%3Aoffsite\\_conversion.lead\n\nshown above (which is \u201cLeads (Conversion)\u201d in the UI).\n\n\n###\n Instagram Video Views\n\n\n To show Instagram video views, do the following:\n\n\n1. Create a \"Custom Insights\" report.\n2. Select interesting metrics. \u201cActions\u201d should bring back a column about video views.\n3. Select\n **Placement**\n as the breakdown option.\n4. Choose the level to report (\n **Account**\n ,\n **Campaign**\n ,\n **AdSet**\n ,\n **Ad**\n ).\n5. Select the date range and time increment.\n\nThis will return information for many different placement options. The most interesting one is called \u201cinstagramstream.\u201d There should also be a column called \u201cActionsVideoView\u201d that lists the number of video views.\n\n##\n Aggregating Statistics\n\nIt is often tempting to use a Custom Insights report that is reporting at a very detailed level to calculate results for a higher level. For example, a DataSet may be reporting daily metrics for multiple campaigns. You could add up the daily data for all the campaigns in order to determine the total for the account that holds the campaigns. This works for some metrics like Clicks, Spend, or Impressions. However, for metrics that count individual people (such as \"Reach\"), this approach will fail and produce incorrect values. \"Reach,\" for example, fails because individuals are counted for each day they saw an ad. Then, if the Reach values for the month are added together, those people are counted multiple times. If the user compares this result to the result for the month in the Facebook Ads UI, they find that the aggregated value is far too high. The Facebook Ads UI removed the duplicated viewers, and only counted them once in the specified time period.\n\n\n To avoid this problem, any time the user wants to get a value for a larger time period, the period needs to be defined in the DataSet itself, and not calculated afterward. If a user wants Reach for a particular month, the DataSet should be defined with the start and end dates for the month, and the\n **Time Increment**\n value should be set to\n\nall\\_days\n\nor left blank. The user can get monthly data, aggregated and deduplicated by Facebook, by setting a large date range (for example, Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2016) and entering\n\nmonthly\n\nas the\n **Time Increment**\n value. Similarly, if a user wants Reach data at the Account level, the user needs to set the DataSet's\n **Level**\n value to\n **Accounts**\n (not\n **Campaigns**\n ), followed by summing the values in Domo.\n\n\n It is often useful to compare the results of the connector to the results available in the Facebook Ads UI. To perform the comparison correctly, however, the UI and the connector need to be configured identically. They need to be set to the same time period (start and end dates) as well as the same reporting level and time increment value.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* The most common problem occurs when the returned data and the Facebook Ads UI do not match. This happens when the DataSet and the report in the Facebook UI are not configured exactly the same way. Make sure the following parameters match:\n\n+ Start Date\n\t+ End Date\n\t+ Breakdown\n\t+ Level\n\t+ Time Increment.\n* Metrics related to individuals (such as Reach) should NOT be aggregated across time periods in Domo. These metrics have duplicates already removed by the Facebook Ads system.\n\nFAQ\n-----\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou will need the email address that is associated with your Facebook account, and your Facebook password. The login process uses the OAuth process, so your password is never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n Do I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?\n\nYou will need a Facebook account that has access to the Facebook Ads account(s) that you are interested in. There are three levels of access available: Analyst, Advertiser and Administrator. Analyst-level access is enough for the reports available in the connector.\n\n###\n How do I choose the columns I need in a Custom Insights report?\n\nThe Custom Insights report is very flexible and will allow you to create nearly any report that can be created in the Facebook Ads UI. However, figuring out how to map between the column names shown in the Facebook Ads UI and the list of available columns/categories can be tricky. The following steps can help:\n\n. In the Facebook Ads UI, open the report that you want to duplicate in Domo.\n2. On the right-hand side of the screen click the button labeled\n **Columns**\n and select\n **Customize Columns**\n . You should now see a dialog box that lets you choose and reorder columns that will be in the report.\n3. Pick a column to add to the report and click\n **Apply**\n .\n4. If you look at the URL, you'll see a URL parameter called 'columns'. This will look something like this:\n\n\n columns=[\"name\",\"date\\_start\",\"date\\_stop\",\"reach\",\"cpm\",\"cpp\",\"spend\",\"clicks\",\"unique\\_clicks\",\"ctr\",\"unique\\_ctr\",\"cpc\",\"actions:offsite\\_conversion.lead\",\"social\\_reach\"]\n\t* Each of the items between quotes is a column. The names that are shown in the Columns field are identical or very close to the names presented by Domo.\n\t* Columns that are part of a larger category may vary slightly in this interface and the Domo interface. For example, \"actions\" expands into several smaller fields, including \"actions:offsite\\_conversion.lead\". In the Domo interface, this column is called \"Leads (Conversion)\".\n\n\n####\n How do I get statistics about Instagram Views?\n\nInstagram ads are included as a special placement option for ads. The following steps will get statistics about them:\n\n. Create a\n **Custom Insights**\n report.\n2. Select interesting metrics. (For example,\n **Actions**\n should bring back a column about video views.)\n3. Select\n **Placement**\n as the breakdown option.\n4. Choose the level to report (Account, Campaign, AdSet, Ad).\n5. Select the date range and time increment.\n\nThis will return information for a lot of different placement options, including\n **instagramstream**\n and\n **ActionsVideoView**\n .\n\n###\n How do I get information or insights for all my campaigns, ad sets, or ads, including new campaigns, ad sets, or ads I create in the future?\n\nTo get information on all campaigns, ad sets, or ads associated with specific accounts (even if you create those campaigns, ad sets, or ads after the creation of the report):\n\n. Select the new\n **Object Information**\n report and the account(s) you wish to report on.\n2. Select the\n **Object Type**\n (Account, Campaign, Ad Set, or Ad).\n\nOR\n\n. Select the\n **Ad Accounts**\n report and the account(s) you wish to report on.\n2. Select the appropriate\n **Ad Account e**\n dge.\n\t* To get information on all campaigns, select\n\t **Ad Campaigns**\n\t .\n\t* To get information on all ad sets, select\n\t **Ad Sets**\n\t .\n\t* To get information on all ads, select\n\t **Ads**\n\t .\n\nTo get insights on all campaigns, ad sets, or ads associated with specific accounts (even if you create those campaigns, ad sets, or ads after the creation of the report):\n\n. Select the new\n **Object Insights**\n report and the account(s) you wish to report on.\n2. Select the\n **Object Type**\n (Account, Campaign, Ad Set, or Ad).\n3. Select the desired parameters in all the other fields.\n\nOR\n\n. Select the\n **Ad Accounts**\n report and the account(s) you wish to report on.\n2. Select the\n **Insights Ad Account**\n edge.\n3. Select the appropriate Level.\n\t* To get insights on all campaigns, select\n\t **Ad Campaign**\n\t .\n\t* To get insights on all ad sets, select\n\t **Ad Set**\n\t .\n\t* To get insights on all ads, select\n\t **Ad**\n\t .\n4. Select the desired parameters in all the other fields.\n\n\n####\n What is the difference between the Facebook Ads and Facebook Ads Advanced connectors?\n\nThe Facebook Ads Advanced connector provides far more reports and options than the Facebook Ads connector. The biggest difference is that the Custom Insights report is only available in the Advanced connector.\n\n\n The Facebook Ads connector is a predefined set of easy-to-use reports. For more options and flexibility with report configuration, you should use the Advanced connector.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nThe data in this connector is roughly real-time. However, many statistics are subject to change for up to 3 days as Facebook determines the exact number of views, etc.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nFacebook may enforce rate limits on calls to its API, but you should not have to worry about this.\n\n###\n My Facebook Ads DataSets take a long time to run. What can I do to make them run faster?\n\nFacebook Ads is known to take a long time because Facebook has to calculate the results of a query before we can start pulling the data. Depending on the load on their servers, this can take a LONG time. It seems that scheduling queries for off-peak times helps DataSets run faster. For example, one team in India was able to run a Facebook Ads DataSet in 15 minutes, but when another user tried the same DataSet 6-8 hours later, it took about 2 hours.\n\n###\n What version of the Facebook API does this connector use?\n\nThis connector uses version 16.0 of the Facebook API (\n\nhttps://graph.facebook.com/v16.0\n\n).\n\n###\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint URL(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Ad Accounts\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/info\n  |\n|\n Ad Campaigns\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/adcampaign\\_groups\n  |\n|\n Ad Keyword Statistics\n  |\n /keywordstats\n  |\n|\n Ad Sets\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/adcampaigns\n  |\n|\n Ads\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/adgroups\n  |\n|\n Custom Insights\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n General Metrics\n  |\n /{CAMPAIGN\\_GROUP\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Object Informaion-NEW\n  |\n Account Object\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Campaign Object\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Ad Sets Object\n  |\n {AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/adsets\n  |\n|\n Ads Object\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/ads\n  |\n|\n Object Insights-NEW\n  |\n /{AD\\_ACCOUNT\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Page Actions (Ad sets)\n  |\n /{AD\\_SET\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Page Actions (Ads)\n  |\n /{AD\\_SET\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Placement Metrics\n  |\n /{CAMPAIGN\\_GROUP\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n Responder Demographics\n  |\n /{AD\\_SET\\_ID}/insights\n  |\n|\n User\n  |\n /{USER\\_ID}\n  |\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042926754\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003772\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nFacebook Ads Advanced Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,959\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "facebook_ads_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
