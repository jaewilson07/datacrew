The \"Custom Insights\" report is the most flexible report in this connector. It allows you the most control over the reports you generate.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          This connector can take a long time to run if the date range is very long and/or the account selected has a large number of campaigns or ads. The long run time occurs because Facebook is taking a long time to calculate the selected metrics. If the DataSet is taking too long or doesn't complete, the date range needs to be smaller.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Metrics for ads placed through Instagram can be found by using the \"Custom Insights\" report and setting the\n                          \n                           Breakdown\n                          \n                          value to\n                          \n                           Placement\n                          \n                          .

You could add up the daily data for all the campaigns in order to determine the total for the account that holds the campaigns. This works for some metrics like Clicks, Spend, or Impressions. However, for metrics that count individual people (such as \"Reach\"), this approach will fail and produce incorrect values. \"Reach,\" for example, fails because individuals are counted for each day they saw an ad. Then, if the Reach values for the month are added together, those people are counted multiple times. If the user compares this result to the result for the month in the Facebook Ads UI, they find that the aggregated value is far too high. The Facebook Ads UI removed the duplicated viewers, and only counted them once in the specified time period.\n                       \n\n                        To avoid this problem, any time the user wants to get a value for a larger time period, the period needs to be defined in the DataSet itself, and not calculated afterward. If a user wants Reach for a particular month, the DataSet should be defined with the start and end dates for the month, and the\n                        \n                         Time Increment\n                        \n                        value should be set to\n                        \n                         all_days\n                        \n                        or left blank. The user can get monthly data, aggregated and deduplicated by Facebook, by setting a large date range (for example, Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2016) and entering\n                        \n                         monthly\n                        \n                        as the\n                        \n                         Time Increment\n                        \n                        value. Similarly, if a user wants Reach data at the Account level, the user needs to set the DataSet's\n                        \n                         Level\n                        \n                        value to\n                        \n                         Accounts\n                        \n                        (not\n                        \n                         Campaigns\n                        \n                        ), followed by summing the values in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        It is often useful to compare the results of the connector to the results available in the Facebook Ads UI. To perform the comparison correctly, however, the UI and the connector need to be configured identically. They need to be set to the same time period (start and end dates) as well as the same reporting level and time increment value.\n                       \n\n                        Troubleshooting\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The most common problem occurs when the returned data and the Facebook Ads UI do not match. This happens when the DataSet and the report in the Facebook UI are not configured exactly the same way. Make sure the following parameters match:\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Start Date\n                           \n\n\n\n                            End Date\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Breakdown\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Level\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Time Increment.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          Metrics related to individuals (such as Reach) should NOT be aggregated across time periods in Domo. These metrics have duplicates already removed by the Facebook Ads system.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        FAQ\n                       \n\n                        What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n                       \n\n                        You will need the email address that is associated with your Facebook account, and your Facebook password. The login process uses the OAuth process, so your password is never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n                       \n\n                        Do I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?\n                       \n\n                        You will need a Facebook account that has access to the Facebook Ads account(s) that you are interested in. There are three levels of access available: Analyst, Advertiser and Administrator. Analyst-level access is enough for the reports available in the connector.\n                       \n\n                        How do I choose the columns I need in a Custom Insights report?\n                       \n\n                        The Custom Insights report is very flexible and will allow you to create nearly any report that can be created in the Facebook Ads UI. However, figuring out how to map between the column names shown in the Facebook Ads UI and the list of available columns/categories can be tricky. The following steps can help:\n                       \n\n\n                         In the Facebook Ads UI, open the report that you want to duplicate in Domo.\n                        \n\n                         On the right-hand side of the screen click the button labeled\n                         \n                          Columns\n                         \n                         and select\n                         \n                          Customize Columns\n                         \n                         . You should now see a dialog box that lets you choose and reorder columns that will be in the report.\n                        \n\n                         Pick a column to add to the report and click\n                         \n                          Apply\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         If you look at the URL, you'll see a URL parameter called 'columns'. This will look something like this:\n                         \n                         columns=[\"name\",\"date_start\",\"date_stop\",\"reach\",\"cpm\",\"cpp\",\"spend\",\"clicks\",\"unique_clicks\",\"ctr\",\"unique_ctr\",\"cpc\",\"actions:offsite_conversion.lead\",\"social_reach\"]\n                         \n\n                           Each of the items between quotes is a column. The names that are shown in the Columns field are identical or very close to the names presented by Domo.\n                          \n\n                           Columns that are part of a larger category may vary slightly in this interface and the Domo interface. For example, \"actions\" expands into several smaller fields, including \"actions:offsite_conversion.lead\". In the Domo interface, this column is called \"Leads (Conversion)\".\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        How do I get statistics about Instagram Views?\n                       \n\n                        Instagram ads are included as a special placement option for ads. The following steps will get statistics about them:\n                       \n\n\n                         Create a\n                         \n                          Custom Insights\n                         \n                         report.\n                        \n\n                         Select interesting metrics. (For example,\n                         \n                          Actions\n                         \n                         should bring back a column about video views.)\n

                     What is the difference between the Facebook Ads and Facebook Ads Advanced connectors?\n                       \n\n                        The Facebook Ads Advanced connector provides far more reports and options than the Facebook Ads connector. The biggest difference is that the Custom Insights report is only available in the Advanced connector.\n                       \n\n                        The Facebook Ads connector is a predefined set of easy-to-use reports. For more options and flexibility with report configuration, you should use the Advanced connector.\n                       \n\n                        How often can the data be updated?\n                       \n\n                        The data in this connector is roughly real-time. However, many statistics are subject to change for up to 3 days as Facebook determines the exact number of views, etc.\n                       \n\n                        Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n                       \n\n                        Facebook may enforce rate limits on calls to its API, but you should not have to worry about this.\n                       \n\n                        My Facebook Ads DataSets take a long time to run. What can I do to make them run faster?\n                       \n\n                        Facebook Ads is known to take a long time because Facebook has to calculate the results of a query before we can start pulling the data. Depending on the load on their servers, this can take a LONG time. It seems that scheduling queries for off-peak times helps DataSets run faster. For example, one team in India was able to run a Facebook Ads DataSet in 15 minutes, but when another user tried the same DataSet 6-8 hours later, it took about 2 hours.\n                       \n\n                        What version of the Facebook API does this connector use?\n                       \n\n                        This connector uses version 16.0 of the Facebook API (\n                        \n                         https://graph.facebook.com/v16.0\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Report Name\n                          \n\n                           Endpoint URL(s)\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ad Accounts\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/info\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ad Campaigns\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/adcampaign_groups\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ad Keyword Statistics\n                          \n\n                           /keywordstats\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ad Sets\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/adcampaigns\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ads\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/adgroups\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Custom Insights\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           General Metrics\n                          \n\n                           /{CAMPAIGN_GROUP_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Object Informaion-NEW\n                          \n\n                           Account Object\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Campaign Object\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ad Sets Object\n                          \n\n                           {AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/adsets\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Ads Object\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/ads\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Object Insights-NEW\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_ACCOUNT_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Page Actions (Ad sets)\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_SET_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Page Actions (Ads)\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_SET_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Placement Metrics\n                          \n\n                           /{CAMPAIGN_GROUP_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Responder Demographics\n                          \n\n                           /{AD_SET_ID}/insights\n                          \n\n\n\n                           User\n                          \n\n                           /{USER_ID}", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042926754", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
