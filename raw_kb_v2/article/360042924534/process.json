A face gauge uses an image of a face to show progress towards a goal. Three ranges are available\u2014a red frowning face for \"poor,\" an orange face with a blank expression for \"fair,\" and a green smiling face for \"excellent.\" Other gauge types in Domo include\n\nComparative fill gauges\n\n.\n\n*Video - How to Use the Face Gauge Chart**\n\nPowering face gauges\n----------------------\n\nA face gauge requires only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one contains categories, and the other contains the values. If multiple categories are present, only the first category is used; all the others are ignored. If the first category contains more than one series, the series are aggregated to yield a single value for the gauge unless you select\n **No Aggregation**\n . Only three ranges are available in face gauges. For more information about ranges, see\n\nSetting Options for Gauges\n\nand\n\nChart Properties\n\n.\n\n\n For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your face gauge. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a face gauge:\n\nCustomizing face gauges\n-------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a gauge by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n .
