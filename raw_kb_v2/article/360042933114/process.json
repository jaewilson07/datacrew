The Pfilter acts as an array of page filter objects. Any matching column names will be filtered upon page load even if they are based on different DataSets. Results can be validated in POST requests on the network tab.\n                       \n\n                        Examples\n                       \n\n                        Example #1\n                       \n\n                        The following multi-line example shows Pfilters being used to apply filters to an embedded Domo Dashboard.
