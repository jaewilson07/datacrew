Domo provides the ability to create such \"data projections.\" Data projections give viewers an idea of how the data might change between the current value of a chart and upcoming future values.\n                       \n\n                        Data projections come in two types\u2014Last Value Projections and Multi-Period Projections. Last Value Projections project only the last value in your chart, but you can use several different kinds of calculations to make the projection, including linear regression, averaging the previous values, etc. Multi-Period Projections let you project as many future periods as you want, either by using included controls to add and remove periods or by manually entering the desired number in Chart Properties. However, all multi-period projections are based on linear regression (though a number of different options are available for configuring your linear regression).\n                       \n\n                        Last Value Projections\n                       \n\n                        Last Value Projections let you project one future value onto your chart. These are available for the following chart types:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Vertical single bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Vertical grouped bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Vertical stacked bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Line bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Multi-line bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Line with grouped bar\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Multi-line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Curved line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Symbol line\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Curved symbol line\n                         \n\n\n\n                        In line charts, dotted lines are\u00a0used to show how far data values are\u00a0expected to fall or drop when a Last Value Projection is applied. In the following example, the data value is expected to rise to about $27,000, based on a linear regression:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        You could also set projections in a chart with multiple lines, like in the following example:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Likewise, a dotted line is used in a bar chart to show the expected change. A region of different color above the current value indicates an expected increase in the data; a dotted line below the current value indicates an expected drop. In the following example, the user created a projection based on the average of the three values prior to the last value:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        You could also set projections in a chart with grouped or stacked bars, like in the following example:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For a grouped bar with line chart, you can choose to apply a projection to either the last bar or last line that appears in the chart (or both).\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Using Last Value Projections\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Types of Last Value Projections\n                       \n\n                        There are four possible types of Last Value Projections in Domo.

For example, if your data was broken down by week and you chose this option, a separate linear regression would be calculated for all Mondays, all Tuesdays, and so on. At least 2 instances of each data point are required for this to work (e.g. your timeline must have 2 Mondays, 2 Tuesdays, etc.); otherwise the\n                               \n                                Linear Regression Recent Periods\n                               \n                               option will be used as a fallback.\n                              \n\n\n\n                               Linear Regression Recent Periods\n                              \n\n                               Projections are calculated by taking the linear regressions for the data points in the most recent period and applying them to the same points in the next period. If you do not have sufficient data for this to work, the default linear regression option will be used as a fallback.\n                              \n\n\n\n                               Linear Regression Recent Weighted\n                              \n\n                               Projections put more weight on recent periods.
