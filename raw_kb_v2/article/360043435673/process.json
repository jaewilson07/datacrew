In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n There is also a simplified\u00a0version of the Ooyala connector. This connector is almost identical but does not include the \"Ooyala IQ Analytics v.3\" report. For more information about this version, see\n\nOoyala Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Ooyala account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Ooyala\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to monitor viewer habits by device type, platform, screen size, and playthrough rate.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Most viewed videos\n* Total video views\n* Total vs. unique views\n* Video displays/loads/starts\n* Video playthrough rate percentage\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Marketing director\n* Marketing manager\n* Training video producer\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3 (higher when using the \"Ooyala IQ Analytics v.3\" report)\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Retrieve account/brand performance data for account over time.\n* View trends to determine viewer behaviors.\n* Determine analytics regarding device types and platforms to optimize viewing experience.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Ooyala account and create a DataSet, you must have an Ooyala\u00a0API Key and API Secret. You can obtain these credentials by doing the following:\n\n. Log into your account at\n\nhttps://backlot.ooyala.com\n\n.\n2.
