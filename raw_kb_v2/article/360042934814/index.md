##
 Domo Support Portal

Domo now includes a support portal in which you can submit help cases as well as see a list of all cases you have submitted. Many options are available for displaying and editing existing help cases, such as applying filters, displaying charts, renaming and deleting cases, switching to a Kanban view, and so on. Be aware that you can only see cases
 *you*
 have submitted; if someone else submits a case in your behalf (such as a CSM), it does not appear in your cases list.
