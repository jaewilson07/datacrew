Enforcing data\u00a0type integrity is key to optimizing performance. For more information about data types in Domo, see\n\nTypes of data in a DataSet\n\n.\n2. *Not using\n\nGroup By\n\nstatement and aggregating*\n\n\n Use a\n\nGroup by\n\nclause when using aggregations in your\n\nSelect\n\nclause. Without it, you will either get an error or incorrect aggregations. Also, all columns that are not being aggregated should be included in the\n\nGroup by\n\nclause.\n3. *Formatting and commenting code*\n\n\n Formatting your code makes it more accessible to others, and commenting your code gives the user the context and rationale behind your decisions.\n4. *Order of operations, and aggregations*\n\n\n Knowing how SQL executes can help optimize how you write your code. Essentially, the order in which your directives are set to execute can help you optimize and shorten the time it takes for tasks to run.\n5. *Divide by 0*\n\n\n A\n\n(#Div/0)\n\noccurrence happens when a calculation\u2019s denominator is \u20180\u2019. This will cause the code to error out.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043427913\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004550\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nTop 5 Issues Users Experience with DataFlows in Domo\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,878\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "top_5_issues_users_experience_with_dataflows_in_domo", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "dataflow_management", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanUGAS"}]}
