From the
 **Data**
 tab of the Appstore, you can easily deploy any of a number of public DataSets directly to your Domo instance. Because these DataSets are already available in Domo, you don't need to create connector accounts or configure reports; all you need to do is set the scheduling (basic scheduling only) and give the DataSet a name (and an optional description) as described in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Public DataSets are also available from the
 **Connectors**
 tab in the Appstore as well as from the Data Center.


 Available public DataSets are as follows:
