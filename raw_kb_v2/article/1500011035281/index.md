Intro
-------

Aha! is roadmap software that helps you manage your product releases, ideas, integrations, features, and more. Use Domo's Aha! connector to retrieve your Aha! data in Domo, and build better and faster products. Once your Aha! data is in Domo, you can give managers, stakeholders, and team members transparency with real-time, interactive dashboards. Combine your Aha! data with data from Marketing, Development, Project Management, CRM, and more to see the big product picture. Set up alerts to be notified of changes in your key data points. And you can access all your data in real time, from any device. To learn more about the Aha! API, visit their page

No

Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
