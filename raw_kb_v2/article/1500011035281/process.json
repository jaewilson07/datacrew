Use Domo's Aha! connector to retrieve your Aha! data in Domo, and build better and faster products.\u00a0Once your Aha! data is in Domo, you can give managers, stakeholders, and team members transparency with real-time, interactive dashboards. Combine your Aha! data with data from Marketing, Development, Project Management, CRM, and more to see the big product picture. Set up alerts to be notified of changes in your key data points. And you can access all your data in real time, from any device. To learn more about the Aha!
