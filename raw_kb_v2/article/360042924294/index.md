Bar graphs are used to measure quantities or amounts. There are usually two axes, one vertical and one horizontal. One of these axes generally displays the items being measured, and the other displays a numerical scale for measuring the items. The lengths of the bars represent the quantities for the items.


 The following tables list the types of Bar graphs available in Domo. You can click a thumbnail image to see a larger image.

 Vertical Bar graph

|
 In a vertical Bar graph, the most common type of bar graph, the categories are represented along the x-axis, or horizontal axis, and the values are represented along the y-axis, or vertical axis.

 Vertical Grouped Bar graph

|
 A vertical Grouped Bar graph is a type of bar graph in which multiple sets of data items are compared, with a single color used to denote a specific series across all the sets. In this way you can compare more information in a single graph.

 Vertical Grouped Bar with Line graph

|
 A Grouped Bar with Line graph is a combination of a Line graph and a Grouped Bar graph. It includes two y-axes, one on each side of the graph. One of these is used to measure the values along the line, and the other is used to measure the values of the bars. By default, the first data item appears as a line and all the others appear as bars; however, you can change this in
 **Chart Properties**
 . This type of graph is useful in situations in which you need to show a trend along with the specific quantities or amounts associated with that trend.

|
 Vertical Line with Grouped Bar graph

|
 This graph type is exactly the same as a Grouped Bar with Line graph except that by default, the first data item appears as a bar and all of the others appear as lines. As with a Grouped Bar with Line graph, you can change this default behavior in

|
|
 Vertical Stacked Bar graph

|
 In a vertical Stacked Bar graph, categories are represented as bars, as in a basic Bar graph, but the bars are composed of series that are "stacked" on top of each other, with each series representing its value.


 For more information, see

Stacked Bar Graph

.
  |

|
|
 Vertical Stacked Bar with Line graph

|
 A Stacked Bar with Line graph combines the features of a Line graph and a vertical Stacked Bar graph. There are two y-axes, one on the left and the other on the right. The y-axis on the left measures the values along the line, and the one on the right measures the values of the bars.

|
 Vertical Nested Bar graph

|
 In a vertical Nested Bar graph, the total values for all categories are represented as vertical gray bars, and the values for all series are represented as smaller, colored bars and are shown side-by-side in the bars for their respective categories.


 For more information, see

Nested Bar Chart

.
  |

|
|
 Vertical Nested Bar with Line graph

|
 This graph is a combination of a Grouped Bar with Line graph and Vertical Nested Bar graph. Total values for all categories are represented as vertical gray bars. Of the series, the first series in the legend is represented as a line and all of the other series are represented as smaller, colored bars within their respective category bars. The line and gray total bars are measured on the left vertical axis, and the colored series bars are measured on the right axis.

|
 Vertical 100% Stacked Bar graph

|
 A vertical 100% Stacked Bar graph is a vertical Stacked Bar graph in which each series in a category represents a percentage of that category, similar to a Pie-type graph.


 For more information, see

100% Stacked Bar Chart

.
  |

|
|
 Vertical 100% Stacked Bar with Line graph

|
 A 100% Stacked Bar with Line graph is the same as a 100% Stacked Bar graph in that each series in a percentage stack represents a percentage of that category. It also includes one or more trendlines, similar to our other bar-line combination graphs.


 For more information, see

100% Stacked Bar with Line Chart

.
  |  |
|
 Vertical Percent of Total graph

|
 A vertical Percent of Total graph is a vertical Bar graph with a percent scale instead of a value scale—each category bar represents the relative size of its value as a percentage rather than the actual value. Percent of Total graphs are essentially Pie graphs with bars; however, because no legend is required to match names with categories, these graphs are actually easier to read and interpret than Pie-type graphs.

|
 Vertical Marimekko graph

|
 A Marimekko graph is somewhat similar to a 100% Stacked Bar graph in that items within categories represent a percentage of a category, as in a Pie-type graph. However, it is different in that it represents values through column width as well as height, making it easier to see differences in the values of different items.


 For more information, see

Marimekko Chart

.
  |

|
|
 Pareto graph

|
 A Pareto graph is a bar graph with categories ordered according to the size of their data item (largest to smallest). A line above the bars shows the cumulative value of all of the data items to that point. A Pareto graph has two scales—one on the left that measures the actual data values, and one on the right that measures the percentage of the total value of the data series. These graphs are useful for discerning the impact of certain categories of data on a data series, and they allow you to see those categories that most (or least) contributed to the entire series.

|
 Vertical Grouped and Stacked Bar graph

|
 Grouped and Stacked Bar graphs combine the features of Grouped Bar and Stacked Bar graphs. In a Grouped and Stacked Bar graph, the first two series of a category are shown side by side, and all additional series are shown as segments in one or both bars. This kind of chart is useful in situations when you want to compare a primary series (such as a series representing sales data for your company headquarters) against several secondary series (such as those series representing sales data for branch offices). In vertical Grouped and Stacked Bar graphs, categories appear on the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and values are measured along the vertical axis (or y-axis).

|
 Vertical Grouped and Stacked Bar with Line graph

|
 A Grouped and Stacked Bar with Line graph is a combination of a vertical Grouped and Stacked Bar graph and a Stacked Bar with Line graph. As in a Stacked Bar with Line graph, two value scales are present and series can appear as either lines or bars; this chart type also gives you the ability to divide series segments between bars, as in a Grouped and Stacked Bar graph. As with standard Grouped and Stacked Bar graphs, this chart type is useful when you want to compare a primary series against several secondary series; however, because it includes a trendline, it is more compatible with time-series data than a regular Grouped and Stacked Bar graph.

|
 Vertical Bullet graph

|
 Bullet graphs are used to depict progress towards a goal, and contain two or more ranges (for example, "poor," "average," and "excellent"). Unlike other kinds of gauges, which represent a single data value, Bullet graphs can measure multiple data values in a smaller space, providing a richer and more meaningful viewing experience. In Vertical Bullet graphs, categories appear on the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and the category values are measured along the vertical axis (or y-axis).

|
|
 Vertical Waterfall graph

|
 Waterfall graphs are essentially Bar graphs that show a series of profits and losses for a specified time period, together with a summary bar showing the amount remaining at the end of the time period. Profits appear as green bars, losses appear as red bars, and start and summary bars appear as blue bars. By default, Waterfall graphs display only value and category data, but you can show summary bars for individual series by checking a box in
 **Chart Properties**
 . In vertical Waterfall graphs, categories appear on the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and category values are measured along the vertical axis (or y-axis).

 Vertical Running Total Bar graph

|
 In a Running Total Bar graph, each successive category bar shows the cumulative value of all categories up to that point in the succession. In a Running Total Bar graph, each category contains only one series, so only one bar displays for each data point.


 For more information, see

Running Total Bar Graph

.
  |

|
|
 Vertical Running Total Grouped Bar graph

|
 In a Running Total Grouped Bar graph, multiple series are present for two or more categories, and these series are shown side by side, as in a vertical Grouped Bar Graph. Each series bar shows the cumulative value for all series bars in that category up to that point.


 For more information, see

Running Total Grouped Bar Graph

.
  |

|
|
 Vertical Running Total Stacked Bar graph

|
 In a Running Total Stacked Bar graph, multiple series are present for two or more categories, and these series are shown stacked on top of each other, as in a vertical Stacked Bar Graph. Each bar in a stack shows the cumulative value for all series bars in that category up to that point.


 For more information, see

Running Total Stacked Bar Graph

  |

|
|
 Vertical Overlay Bar graph

|
 A Vertical Overlay Bar is similar to a standard Stacked Bar graph except that instead of being stacked, all series items begin from the baseline, so overlapping of series items occurs in a category when multiple series are present. In its initial non-rollover state, an Overlay graph is rather meaningless, as shown in the first example at right. However, by mousing over a series item in the legend, you can see just that series in the chart, as shown in the second example at right. In many applications this may be more useful than a Stacked Bar because you can more quickly compare series items in different categories. (In a Stacked Bar this is difficult because series in different categories do not usually begin from the same baseline.)

Overlay Bar Graph

|
 Vertical Histogram graph

|
 A Histogram is a chart type, usually used for statistical analysis, that represents the frequency at which certain ranges of values appear in a DataSet. For example, you could create a histogram showing the frequency at which specific height ranges appear in a group. In a vertical Histogram, values are represented along the x-axis as ranges, and categories are counted and represented numerically on the y-axis.

 Funnel Bars graph

|
 A Funnel Bars graph is a combination of a Funnel graph and a horizontal Bar graph. This graph type shows differences between one stage in a process (such as a sales cycle) and the next. For each stage in the process, the data for the previous round drops off, so that only the relationships between the current round and all subsequent rounds is shown. In essence, this chart type shows "what's left" after each stage in a process. The example at right shows a Funnel Bars graph for a typical sales cycle. Each subsequent stage depicts the number of potential customers who have progressed to that stage.

 Spark Bar graph

|
 A Spark Bar graph is essentially a Bar graph with no axes (providing a cleaner, uncluttered experience) and a built-in gauge that by default shows the degree of change between the first and last data points in the graph. Spark Bar graphs are excellent for quickly showing relative rises and falls in data over time.
