This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding our public API SDKs.


 Product Details
-----------------


####
 Why do we need this feature?

As businesses attempt to leverage and extend the Domo platform via automation through its APIs, many have found challenges with the complexity of maintaining authentication to the Domo’s API layer as well as the effort required to maintain additional code required to integrate with RESTful endpoints.


 Domo has now provided first class SDKs to significantly reduce the level of effort that customers, partners, and developers need to implement integrations with Domo’s set of Public APIs – ultimately providing the ability to create more solutions in much less time.

###
 What specifically has improved?

Specific improvements include:

 Graceful handling of Authentication


 Previously, you had to continue to authenticate via OAuth every hour. With each SDK, you no longer are forced through the tedious effort of managing connections to the APIs.
* Inline Documentation


 While editing code inside an editor like IntelliJ, a user will be able to drill into each object and learn specific details about parameters. In addition, each object guides the developer on required parameters and overall structure.
* Ability to branch code for custom solutions


 With the open-source nature of each SDK, users can download the latest version of an SDK and then personalize it to create solutions for specific use cases and needs.
