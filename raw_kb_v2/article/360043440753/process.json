With each SDK, you no longer are forced through the tedious effort of managing connections to the APIs.\n* Inline Documentation\n\n\n While editing code inside an editor like IntelliJ, a user will be able to drill into each object and learn specific details about parameters. In addition, each object guides the developer on required parameters and overall structure.\n* Ability to branch code for custom solutions\n\n\n With the open-source nature of each SDK, users can download the latest version of an SDK and then personalize it to create solutions for specific use cases and needs.\n\n\n####\n Is a migration required? What is the plan?\n\nNo migration is needed.\n\n\n Product Setup\n---------------\n\n\n####\n Is a feature switch required for this Product?\n\nNo\n\n###\n Are there any requirements for using this Product?\n\nKnowledge of Python, Java, or Node languages.\n\n###\n Are there any role restrictions for this product?\n\nRole restrictions will continue to be observed with the authentication process.\u00a0 If you are not an admin, you will not be able to leverage the APIs.\n\n###\n Can I control who can use this product?\n\nNo.\n\n###\n Are there any other admin capabilities around this product?\n\nYes, you can manage access tokens for people who are using a token to integrate with any of the Public APIs.\n\n###\n Is there anything else about the setup users should know about?\n\nNo, all SDKs can be found on Domo\u2019s Github repo here:\n\nhttps://github.com/domoinc/\n\nProduct Compatibility\n-----------------------\n\n\n####\n Does this product work for customers who have SSO enabled?\n\nNo, we are working to enable obtaining Client ID and Secrets for customers using SSO.\n\n###\n Does this product work with PDP?\n\nYes, there is a PDP API that is a part of each SDK.\n\n###\n Does this product work with internal or external Publication Groups, Alerts, Buzz, Mobile, page filters, card filters, or card Save As?\n\nNo.\n\n\n Product Cost and Freemium\n---------------------------\n\n\n####\n Is there a cost associated with using this product?\n\nNo.\n\n###\n Where does this product fit in Domo\u2019s pricing tier?\n\nThis product is included with Domo Professional and Enterprise versions.
