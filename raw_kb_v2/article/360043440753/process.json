With each SDK, you no longer are forced through the tedious effort of managing connections to the APIs.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Inline Documentation\n                          \n                          While editing code inside an editor like IntelliJ, a user will be able to drill into each object and learn specific details about parameters. In addition, each object guides the developer on required parameters and overall structure.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Ability to branch code for custom solutions\n                          \n                          With the open-source nature of each SDK, users can download the latest version of an SDK and then personalize it to create solutions for specific use cases and needs.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Is a migration required?
