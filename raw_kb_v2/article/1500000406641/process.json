For this version of the app, connector-based DataSets that are updated through outside sources are not recommended, as any changes you save are overwritten by data coming through the connector.\n                       \n\n                        Standard DataSets have some inherent limitations in terms of how they can be updated, and because of this, if your app is using a standard DataSet you are limited to DataSets that have 100,000 or fewer rows and 500 or fewer columns.\n                       \n\n                        Upsert DataSets can be any size, but they take a little extra effort to set up. Follow the instructions below to convert a DataSet to an upsert DataSet.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Converting to an Upsert DataSet\n                       \n\n                        (Optional) To convert a DataSet to an upsert DataSet, follow the steps below.\n                       \n\n\n                         In Domo, navigate to your DataSet.\n                        \n\n                         Go to the\n                         \n                          Settings\n                         \n                         tab, then select the\n                         \n                          Update Mode\n                         \n                         setting to expand it.\n                        \n\n                         Select the\n                         \n                          Update method\n                         \n                         and choose\n                         \n                          Append\n                         \n                         from the list.\n                        \n\n                         Select\n                         \n                          Save\n                         \n                         to keep your changes.\n                        \n\n                         Now create your upsert keys.\n                         \n                         Upsert keys are a\u00a0group of columns in your data that when put together create a unique key for each row\u2014 you must set these keys\u00a0manually.\n                         \n                          The next steps describe how\u00a0to set your keys.\n                         \n\n\n                         Download the Java CLI tool using the following link:\n                         \n                          https://app-domo-com-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/labs/java-sdk/latest/domoUtil.jar\n                         \n\n\n                         Navigate to and run the JAR file from either your terminal or command line tool.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             To run the JAR file in the Mac Terminal, make sure you have java installed and then navigate to the correct directory and use the following command:\n                             \n\n                               'java -jar domoUtil.jar'\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         When the program is running in your command line, you'll first need to connect to your Domo instance and use the command:\n                         \n\n                           connect -s <domain> -t <access_token>\n                          \n\n\n                          <domain> is the name of your Domo instance (\n                          \n                           mycompany\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n                           domo.com\n                          \n                          ), and\u00a0<access_token> is a generated access token from your Domo instance.
