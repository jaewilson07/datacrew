Intro
-------

You can format the size of bars in bar charts using various options in
 **Chart Properties**
 , including the following:

 Changing the percentage of space taken up by each bar
* Specifying how bars appear in charts with only one bar

Changing bar width or height percentage
-----------------------------------------

In a bar chart, each bar takes up a set amount of space. By default, a bar takes up about 90% of its given space. By changing the
 **Width Percentage**
 or
 **Height Percentage**
 for a vertical or horizontal bar chart, respectively, you can change the percentage of space taken up by each bar. Possible values range from 0 (at which bars appear as lines) to 100 (at which bars touch other bars).


 The following example shows a vertical bar chart with a
 **Width Percentage**
 of

20

.

The following example shows the same chart with a
 **Width Percentage**
 of

100

.
