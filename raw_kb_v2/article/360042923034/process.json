The first time you run a DataFlow, it generates one or more new DataSets based on the data in your input DataSets, any SQL transforms you have applied, and how you have indicated that you want them to be combined, also using SQL. On subsequent runs, the DataSets are updated to accommodate new changes to the input DataSets themselves as well as any changes you have made to the SQL for the DataFlow.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Notes:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                              You cannot run a\n                             \n\n                              DataFlow\n                             \n\n                              if you do not have access to any of its component\n                             \n\n                              DataSets\n                             \n\n                              .\n                             \n\n\n                             If a DataSet fails to execute, it will retry once automatically with no notifications being sent. If the DataFlow continues to fail after the first attempt, notifications will be sent.\n                            \n\n                             In previous versions of DataFlows, you could not execute a DataFlow while a previously executed DataFlow was in the indexing state. This is no longer the case. You can now execute multiple DataFlows at once.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n                            Input DataSets\u00a0in a DataFlow\u00a0cannot be restricted by PDP policies\u2014all available rows\n                            \n                             must\n                            \n                            pass through the DataFlow. Because of this you must apply PDP policies to the output DataSets generated by a DataFlow.\n                            \n\n\n                            When you build a DataFlow using an input DataSet\u00a0with PDP\u00a0policies in place,\u00a0the DataFlow breaks unless\u00a0at least one of the following criteria\u00a0applies:\n                           \n\n\n\n                              You have an \"Admin\" security profile.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              You are\u00a0the DataSet owner.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              You are\u00a0part of the \"All Rows\" policy.
