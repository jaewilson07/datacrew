This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BrandIndex connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your BrandIndex account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address associated with your BrandIndex account\n* Your BrandIndex password\n\nConnecting to Your BrandIndex Account\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the BrandIndex Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your BrandIndex account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Email\n  |\n Enter the email associated with your BrandIndex account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password associated with your BrandIndex account.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid BrandIndex credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new BrandIndex DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the BrandIndex report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Brands List\n  |\n Returns a list of brands for a given region and sector.\n  |\n|\n Custom Sectors\n  |\n Returns a list of custom sectors.\n  |\n|\n Demographic Filters\n  |\n Returns a list of demographic filters for the \"Multi Brand Query\" report.\n  |\n|\n Metric Filters\n  |\n Returns a list of available metric filters for the \"Multi Brand Query\" report.\n  |\n|\n Multi Brand Query\n  |\n Returns data for multiple brands.\n  |\n|\n Regions\n  |\n Returns a list of regions.

You can find a list of regions by running the \"Regions\" report.\n  |\n|\n Sector\n  |\n Enter the ID for the sector you want to retrieve data for. You can find a list of sectors by running the \"Sectors\" report.\n  |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter your Brandlndex query to retrieve data for multiple brands. You must provide at least one brand, sector, or custom sector parameter. The brand parameter can have single or multiple brands separated by the\n\n&\n\nsymbol.\n\n\n The query can include filters in the following formats:\n\n\n**Sectors**\n :\n\nsector=region:sector\\_id[:demo\\_filters][:metric\\_filters][:metrics]\n\n*Custom Sectors:**\n\ncustom\\_sector=region:custom\\_sector\\_id[:demo\\_filters][:metric\\_filters][:metrics] for custom sectors\n\n*Brand Queries:**\n\nbrand=region:sector\\_id:brandJd[:demo\\_filters][:metric\\_filters][:metrics]\n\nFor example:\n\nbrand=us:123:1234:/brand.3456.reputation.1&brand=us:234:2345:/foo\\_filter.1/bar\\_filter.2\\\n\nThis query would retrieve brand ID \"1234\"\u00a0from sector \"123\" and\u00a0from the \"U.S.\" region\u00a0with a metric filter reputation value of \"1\" for brand \"3456,\" as well as brand ID \"2345\"\u00a0from sector \"234\" and\u00a0from the \"U.S.\" region, with the following demographic filters:\n\nfoo\\_filter\n\nvalue of \"1\" and\n\nbar\\_filter\n\nvalue of \"2.\"\n\n\n Brandlndex does not require you to supply demo filters, metric filters, or metrics. You are able to supply any combination of the filters and metrics, but you must include at least one brand, sector, or custom sector.\n  |\n|\n Scoring Type\n  |\n The scoring option to use, within \"total\" (includes all respondents, including unaware respondents), \"aware\" (excludes unaware respondents) and \"opinion\" (excludes both unaware respondents and respondents who don't have a positive or negative opinion of the brand).\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434173\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003505\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nYouGov Brand Index Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,386\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "yougov_brand_index_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
