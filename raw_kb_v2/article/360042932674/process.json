In the\n **Jobs**\n pane, you add a new job by clicking the \"+\" icon. Here you specify\u00a0basic settings for the job, including the\u00a0Domo\u00a0domain (server), the\u00a0DataSet\u00a0job name, the\u00a0method of data transport (such as Local File Provider, ODBC Connection Provider, etc.), the data reader (data source) type (such as JIRA, Excel, etc.), the DataSet name and type, and an optional DataSet description.\u00a0(The DataSet name is the\n *only*\n setting you can change after creating the job. If you want to change any other settings, you will need to create a new job.) This adds an entry for the DataSet Job to your\n\njobs listing. However, at this stage the DataSet Job is still not ready for execution.\n2. In the\n **Configure**\n subtab for the job...\n\n1. You indicate the source of the data in the\n\t **Source**\n\t menu. For example, if the data source was a local file, you would select the file path here.\n\t2. You specify additional\u00a0settings for the data source in the\n\t **Processing**\n\t menu. These\u00a0settings differ between data source types.\u00a0Some, such as replacement variables for queries, are optional, while others are required.\n\t3. You choose whether you want newly uploaded data to REPLACE the existing data in the DataSet or be APPENDED (added) to the existing data. You do this in the\n\t **Update method**\n\t menu.\n\t4. If desired, you\u00a0can configure miscellaneous options for the job, such as transforms, notifications, excluded columns, etc.\n\nFor information about the controls and field settings in Workbench, see\n\nUnderstanding the Workbench 5\u00a0User Interface.\n\n\n**Video - Creating a Job in Workbench 5**\n\nFor specific information about all of the connector types available in Workbench 5, visit the following links:\n\n Connecting to Excel Data in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to CSV Data in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to JIRA Data in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to ODBC Data in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to an OLAP Cube in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to XML Data in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to QuickBooks Data in Workbench 5\n* Connecting to JSON Data in Workbench 5\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932674\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004827\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCreating a Job for Uploading Data Using Workbench 5\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,959\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:31 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "creating_a_job_for_uploading_data_using_workbench_5", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_5", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapTGAS"}]}
