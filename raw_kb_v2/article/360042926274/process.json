A data Connector (similar to an alias or DSN) lets you define connection information to a DataSet. While adding a DataSet using a Connector, you can specify the connection information for the specific data provider. Afterwards when you power up Cards you can use the DataSet by selecting the Connector by name.\n                       \n\n                        This topic discusses the interface components common to all third-party Connectors.

Most Connectors require you\u00a0to enter login credentials, an API key,\u00a0a server\u00a0URL, or a combination of these to access the Connector. If you cannot connect after entering your credentials, you have most likely entered incorrect credentials. For information about finding credentials, see the documentation for your specific Connector. You can find this under\n                        \n                         API Connectors\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        After you connect, you are usually asked for\u00a0information about the data you want to pull and the desired format. Most Connectors have two or more associated report types. In addition, many Connectors request a timeframe for the data to be\u00a0retrieved. You may also be asked to submit a query for retrieving data. For example, when connecting to JIRA you can enter a JQL query to retrieve data for a specified search filter.\n                       \n\n                        For most Connectors, you are also asked to schedule data updates. You can use basic scheduling, in which you select a single, specific unit of time (such as \"Every hour\") and enter the time of day when the update is to occur, if required. Or you can use advanced scheduling, in which you can select multiple update times.\n                       \n\n                        The information in this section is general and may or may not be\u00a0required for\u00a0a certain Connector.

This means that you only need to enter your credentials once for a given account. In the future, when you go to create a DataSet using this Connector account, your credentials are passed in automatically. Other Connectors do not use OAuth, so you must enter your credentials each time you create a DataSet using this Connector account.\n                       \n\n                        Details\n                       \n\n                        Most Connectors include a\n                        \n                         Details\n                        \n                        settings category.\u00a0Here you usually specify\u00a0options like the report to run, the timeframe for the data, a data query for pulling specific information from a database, and so on.\u00a0If\u00a0a query is required, the type of query you need to use depends on the Connector type and the source data in your system.\n                       \n\n                        Click\n                        \n                         Load Preview\n                        \n                        to verify that your data is accessible.
