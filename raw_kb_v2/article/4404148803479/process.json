This connector allows you to connect with your Domo Developer account credentials (client id and client secret).\n\n\n You export your data in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the DataSet Copy Unload connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need your\u00a0Domo Client ID and Client Secret.\n\n\n To create your Domo client ID and client secret:\n\n. Log into the\n\nDomo developer account\n\n.\n2. In the top right corner under\n **My Account**\n click\n **New Client**\n .\n3. Enter the application name and description.\n4. Provide the application scope by selecting the checkboxes for\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n6.
