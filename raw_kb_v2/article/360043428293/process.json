With this method, only the matching columns have to have the same header or data type. \"Add Rows\" combines DataSets by combining the rows from those DataSets. With this method, all columns must have the same header.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Note:\n                            \n                            If any DataSets in a DataFusion are out of date, the DataFusion itself will show as being out of date. When DataSets with PDP policies are used as input (parent)\u00a0DataSets in a DataFusion, those policies are incorporated in the output DataSets\u00a0as well. You cannot apply policies to output DataSets\u00a0from DataFusions; you must apply them to the input (parent)\u00a0DataSets.\u00a0For more information, see\n                            \n                             PDP and DataFusions/\n                            \n\n                             DataFlows\n                            \n                            .\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - Combining DataSets Using DataFusion\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Combining DataSets using the Combine Columns method\n                       \n\n                        In this method, you select two or more DataSets, each of which contains at least one column that matches a column or data type in one of the others. You then combine all of the DataSets into a single DataSet by matching similar columns. This method is equivalent to using a JOIN in SQL.\n                       \n\n                        In the following example, a user uploads and combines two DataSets using this method. The user matches the \"Order #\" and \"Order Number\" columns, and the second DataSet appears to the right of the first.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The user could go a step further and add a third DataSet that provides company information.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The user then excludes the duplicate \"Order Number\" and \"Company\" columns. The final fused DataSet appears as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                         To combine DataSets using the Add Columns method,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n

Domo then combines the rows from each DataSet into a single DataSet. This method is equivalent to using a UNION ALL in SQL.\n                       \n\n                        In the following example, a user uploads and combines two DataSets using this method. The second DataSet is appended directly below the first.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Important:\n                             \n                             All DataSets you combine using this method\n                             \n                              must\n                             \n                             have the same column headings and column order. Also, data types must match between matching columns. For example, if a column from one DataSet is formatted as\n                             \n                              DATE\n                             \n                             , then that same column in all other DataSets must also be formatted as\n                             \n                              DATE\n                             \n                             . Possible data types are as follows:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                              LONG stores numbers as numeric values, including decimal, fractional, and whole numbers.\n
