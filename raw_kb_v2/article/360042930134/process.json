To learn more about the Yelp Reporting API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/developers\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Yelp Reporting account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Yelp Reporting connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Yelp account and create a dataset, you must have your Yelp Reporting API username and password. This username and password is different from your standard Yelp login. To request your credentials, please reach out to your Yelp sales representative. Your Yelp sales representative will create the credentials and share them with you.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Yelp Reporting Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Yelp Reporting Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Yelp account.
