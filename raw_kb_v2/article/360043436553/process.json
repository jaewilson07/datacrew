You can use Domo's Dropbox\u00a0File Advanced connector to retrieve CSV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, XML, and ZIP files from a selected Dropbox account.\u00a0To learn more about the\u00a0Dropbox API, go to\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/developers\n\n.\n\n\n This connector is different from the standard Dropbox File connector in that it allows you to import JSON, XML, and ZIP file types in addition to CSV, XLS, and XLSX. It also provides more filter options for locating your file. For more information about the standard Dropbox File connector, see\n\nDropbox File Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Dropbox account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Dropbox\u00a0File Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Dropbox account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you enter to access your Dropbox account.\n* Your Dropbox password.\n\nConnecting to Your Dropbox Account\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Dropbox\u00a0File Advanced Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Dropbox\u00a0File Advanced connector uses OAuth to connect. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Dropbox accounts in Domo) to open the Dropbox OAuth screen where you can enter the email address associated with your Dropbox account and your Dropbox password. Once you have entered valid Dropbox credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Dropbox\u00a0File Advanced DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Dropbox when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Dropbox.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane, you specify the file name and file type of the Dropbox file you want to import into Domo and configure various other options.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n File Type\n  |\n Select the file type for the file you want to import.

You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n####\n Can I use the same account to create multiple DataSets?\n\nYes.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n What's the difference between this connector and the standard version?\n\nThe Dropbox File connector imports only CSV, XLS and XLSX files, whereas\u00a0the Dropbox File Advanced connector also imports JSON, XML and ZIP files. The Dropbox File Advanced connector also provides some advanced filters to import the data from the file.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436553\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003944\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDropbox File Advanced Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,772\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "dropbox_file_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "file_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaowGAC"}]}
