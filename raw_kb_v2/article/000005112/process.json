To learn more about the PPO API, visit\n\nPPO Web Services API\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the PPO connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your PPO account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your PPO user name\n* Your PPO Password\n* Instance ID referencing to your PPO account\n\nConnecting to Your PPO Account\n--------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the PPO Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains three fields for entering credentials to connect to your PPO account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your user name which is\u00a0the same username for logging into the API services.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your password which is\u00a0the same username for logging into the API services..\n  |\n|\n Instance ID\n  |\n Enter the ID referencing to your PPO account.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid PPO credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new PPO DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains three fields,\n **Entity Type**\n ,\n **Display Value**\n , and\n **Caption Value**\n .\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Entity Type\n  |\n Enter the entity type.
