If you are already using Snowflake as a data warehousing solution, this connector helps you use Domo in conjunction with it to get the most from your data. To use this connector, you must have your Snowflake account name, the username used to connect to your Snowflake host, private key, passphrase, and your Domo developer account credentials (client id and client secret).\u00a0Use Domo's Snowflake Key Pair Authentication Writeback connector to export your data from a Domo dataset to your Snowflake account.\u00a0For more information about the Snowflake API, visit\n\nhttps://docs.snowflake.net/manuals\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Snowflake Key Pair Authentication Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a Snowflake database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The full name of your account (provided by Snowflake). This is the portion of your Snowflake URL immediately following\u00a0https://.\n\n\n Note that your full account name may include additional segments that identify the region and cloud platform where your account is hosted.\u00a0For US West Region\n ****account\\_name****\n and All other regions\n ****account\\_name.region\\_id****\n .\u00a0The following table provides account name examples by cloud platform/region. For each row, it assumes your account name is \"xy12345.\"\n\n The username used to connect to your Snowflake host.\n* The private key.\n* The passphrase. If you create an encrypted private key, then OpenSSL prompts for a passphrase used to encrypt the private key file.\n\n\n**Important**\n : You need the CREATE TABLE, COPY INTO, PUT, CREATE FILE FORMAT, REMOVE, and LIST permissions on Snowflake.\n\n\n###\n Configuring the public/private key pair\n\nTo configure the public/private key pair, follow these steps:\n\n. From the command line in a terminal window, generate a private key.\n\n\n You can generate either an encrypted version of the private key or an unencrypted version of the private key.\n\n\n\t* To generate an unencrypted version, use the following command:\n\n\n\t`$ openssl genrsa -out rsa_key.pem 2048`\n\t* To generate an encrypted version, use the following command:\n\n\n\t`$ openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8`\n\n\n\t It is typically safer to generate an encrypted version.\n\n\n\t If you use the second command to encrypt the private key, then OpenSSL prompts for a passphrase used to encrypt the private key file. We recommend using a strong passphrase to protect the private key. Record this passphrase in a secure location. You will input it when connecting to Snowflake. Note that the passphrase is only used for protecting the private key and will never be sent to Snowflake.\n\n\n\t The following is a sample PEM private key:\n\n\n\t`-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n\n\t MIIE6TAbBgkqhkiG9w0BBQMwDgQILYPyCppzOwECAggABIIEyLiGSpeeGSe3xHP1\n\n\n\t wHLjfCYycUPennlX2bd8yX8xOxGSGfvB+99+PmSlex0FmY9ov1J8H1H9Y3lMWXbL\n\n\n\t ...\n\n\n\t -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----`\n2. From the command line, generate the public key by referencing the private key.\u00a0Assuming the private key is encrypted and contained in the file named \u201crsa\\_key.p8\u201d, use the following command:\n\n\n`$ openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub`\n\n\n The following is a sample PEM\u00a0public key:\n\n\n`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n\n\n MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAy+Fw2qv4Roud3l6tjPH4\n\n\n zxybHjmZ5rhtCz9jppCV8UTWvEXxa88IGRIHbJ/PwKW/mR8LXdfI7l/9vCMXX4mk\n\n\n ...\n\n\n -----END PUBLIC KEY-----`\n3. Copy the public and private key files to a local directory for storage. Record the path to the files. Note that the private key is stored using the PKCS#8 (Public Key Cryptography Standards) format and is encrypted using the passphrase you specified in the previous step; however, the file should still be protected from unauthorized access using the file permission mechanism provided by your operating system. It is your responsibility to secure the file when it is not being used.\n4. Assign\u00a0the public key to the Snowflake user using\u00a0ALTER USER. For example:\n\n\n`alter user jsmith set rsa_public_key='MIIBIjANBgkqh...';`\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\n\t* Only security administrators (i.e. users with the SECURITYADMIN role) or higher can alter a user.\n\t* Exclude the public key header and footer in the SQL statement.\n5. Verify the user\u2019s public key fingerprint using\u00a0DESCRIBE USER:\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Value\n  |\n Default\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Name\n  |\n JSMITH\n  |\n null\n  |\n Name\n  |\n|\n RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY\\_FP\n  |\n SHA256:nvnONUsfiuycCLMXIEWG4eTp4FjhVUZQUQbNpbSHXiA=\n  |\n null\n  |\n Fingerprint of user's RSA public key.\n  |\n|\n RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY\\_2\\_FP\n  |\n null\n  |\n null\n  |\n Fingerprint of user's second RSA public key.\n  |\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nFor more information about the RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY\\_2\\_FP property, see\n\nKey\u00a0Rotation\n\n.\n6. Modify and execute the sample code, below. The code decrypts the private key file and passes it to the Snowflake driver to create a connection:\n\t* Update the security parameters:\n\t\t+ <path> specifies the local path to the private key file you created.\n\t* Update the session parameters:\n\t\t+ <user> specifies your Snowflake login name.\n\t\t+ <account> specifies the name of your account (provided by Snowflake).\n\t* The sample code is as follows:\n\n`import java.util.Properties;\n\n\n\t import java.sql.Connection;\n\n\n\t import java.sql.Statement;\n\n\n\t import java.sql.ResultSet;\n\n\n\t import java.sql.DriverManager;\n\n\n\t import java.io.File;\n\n\n\t import java.io.FileInputStream;\n\n\n\t import java.io.DataInputStream;\n\n\n\t import java.util.Base64;\n\n\n\t import java.security.spec.PKCS8EncodedKeySpec;\n\n\n\t import java.security.KeyFactory;\n\n\n\t import java.security.PrivateKey;\n\n\n\t import javax.crypto.EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo;\n\n\n\t import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;\n\n\n\t import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;`\n\n\n\t`public class TestJdbc\n\n\n\t {\n\n\n\t public static void main(String[] args)\n\n\n\t throws Exception\n\n\n\t {\n\n\n\t File f = new File(\"<path>/rsa_key.p8\");\n\n\n\t FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);\n\n\n\t DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(fis);\n\n\n\t byte[] keyBytes = new byte[(int) f.length()];\n\n\n\t dis.readFully(keyBytes);\n\n\n\t dis.close();`\n\n\n\t`String encrypted = new String(keyBytes);\n\n\n\t String passphrase = System.getenv(\"PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE\");\n\n\n\t encrypted = encrypted.replace(\"-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\", \"\");\n\n\n\t encrypted = encrypted.replace(\"-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\", \"\");\n\n\n\t EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo pkInfo = new EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo(Base64.getMimeDecoder().decode(encrypted));\n\n\n\t PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(passphrase.toCharArray());\n\n\n\t SecretKeyFactory pbeKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(pkInfo.getAlgName());\n\n\n\t PKCS8EncodedKeySpec encodedKeySpec = pkInfo.getKeySpec(pbeKeyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec));\n\n\n\t KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(\"RSA\");\n\n\n\t PrivateKey encryptedPrivateKey = keyFactory.generatePrivate(encodedKeySpec);`\n\n\n\t`String url = \"jdbc:snowflake://<account>.\n\n snowflakecomputing.com\n\n \";\n\n\n\t Properties prop = new Properties();\n\n\n\t prop.put(\"user\", \"<user>\");\n\n\n\t prop.put(\"account\", \"<account>\");\n\n\n\t prop.put(\"privateKey\", encryptedPrivateKey);`\n\n\n\t`Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, prop);\n\n\n\t Statement stat = conn.createStatement();\n\n\n\t ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery(\"select 1\");\n\n\n\t res.next();\n\n\n\t System.out.println(res.getString(1));\n\n\n\t conn.close();\n\n\n\t }\n\n\n\t }`\n\n\n####\n Key Rotation\n\nSnowflake supports multiple active keys to allow for uninterrupted rotation. Rotate and replace your public and private keys based on the expiration schedule you follow internally.\n\n\n Currently, you can use the RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY and RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY\\_2 parameters for ALTER USER to associate up to 2 public keys with a single user.\n\n\n To rotate your keys,\n\n. Complete the steps in Using Key Pair Authentication to...\n\n\n\t* Generate a new private and public key set.\n\t* Assign the public key to the user. Set the public key value to either\u00a0RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY\u00a0or\u00a0RSA\\_PUBLIC\\_KEY\\_2\u00a0(whichever key value is not currently in use).\n\n\n\t For example:\n\n\n\t`alter user jsmith set rsa_public_key_2='JERUEHtcve...';`\n2. Update the code to connect to Snowflake. Specify the new private key.\n\n\n Snowflake verifies the correct active public key for authentication based on the private key submitted with your connection information.\n3. Remove the old public key from the user profile. For example:\n\n\n`alter user jsmith unset rsa_public_key;`\n\nConfiguring the connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nSnowflake Key Pair Authentication Writeback\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to your Domo developer account as well as your Snowflake account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Name\n  |\n Enter the full name of your account (provided by Snowflake.)\u00a0For US West Region\n ****account\\_name****\n and All other regions\n ****account\\_name.region\\_id**** |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0username used to connect to your Snowflake host.\n  |\n|\n Private Key\n  |\n Enter the private key.\n  |\n|\n Passphrase\n  |\n If you create an encrypted private key, then OpenSSL prompts for a passphrase used to encrypt the private key file.

If you are creating an encrypted private key then you will need a passphrase used to encrypt the private key file. You can also provide your role name.\n\n###\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nLimits depend on your server configuration.\n\n###\n Can I use the same account to create multiple datasets?\n\nYes\n\n###\n Why can't I connect to my Snowflake database? Do I need to whitelist any IP addresses?\n\nBefore you can connect to a Snowflake database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the port you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses.\n\n\n####\n How do I find the Input Dataset ID?\n\nYour Domo input dataset ID is in the URL of the dataset you are exporting data from. For example\n\nhttps://customer.domo.com/datasources/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee/details/settings\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360058760154\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004004\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSnowflake Key Pair Authentication Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,800\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "snowflake_key_pair_authentication_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
