The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\n\ndomo.com/datacenter/accounts\n\n) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\n\n\n This change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct Advance connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to retrieve your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\n\n\n Additional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct Advance connector DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\n\n Intacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around. The Intacct Advanced connector also allows you to filter the data based on the creation date or modification date.\n\n\n Once your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the updated information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts through email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\n\nUse Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like. To learn more about the Intacct API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.intacct.com/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Intacct account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Intacct connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nIn your Intacct account, you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Cashflow\n* Ledgers\n* Accounts receivable\n* Accounts payable\n* Journals\n* Profits and loss\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * CFO\n* Accountant\n* Sales\n* Inventory\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Connector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 7\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nThe best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\n\n\n Keep date ranges reasonable. If you only need the last quarter, do the last quarter; if you need the last three years, do all three years.\n\nFor Custom report, this Connector only supports 'current month' and 'current year' as the reporting period values.\n\nThere might be a possibility of having other/additional supported values for Reporting Period. Contact Sage Intacct for other possible Reporting Duration values for filtering the data.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Intacct account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The user ID for your\u00a0Intacct account. This is the same user ID you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\n* The password for your Intacct account. This is the same password you use to sign into the Intacct cloud ERP software.\n* Your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts. To locate the Company ID in Intacct, hover over\n **Company**\n and click\n **Company Info**\n .\n **Company ID**\n is found in the\n **ID**\n field.\n* (Optional) You can also provide a Location ID. This may help narrow your data request to a specific location. To locate the location ID in Intacct, hover over\n **Company**\n and click\n **Locations**\n . Select a\n **Location ID**\n from the report.\n* (Optional) Max Concurrent Connections.\n\nThis is a number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, you can provide how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\n* Additionally, the Customer may need to add \"Domo\" as an\n **authorized sender ID**\n in their company configurations Security tab.\n\nTo obtain Intacct Web Services credentials, contact your Intacct account representative.\n\n\n Connecting to your Intacct Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Intacct Advance Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Intacct account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n User ID\n  |\n Enter your Intacct user ID. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Intacct password. See \"Prerequisites\" for more details.\n  |\n|\n Company ID\n  |\n Enter your Intacct company ID. This ID is usually different for sandbox and production accounts.\n  |\n|\n Location ID (Optional)\n  |\n Enter your Intacct location ID.\u00a0This may help\u00a0you narrow your data request to a specific location.\n  |\n|\n Max Concurrent Connections (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the number value for the maximum number of concurrent connections that Intacct allows for your account. If you have increased your API rate limits with Intacct, specify how many concurrent connections you are allowed here.\n  |\n\n\n After you have entered valid Intacct credentials, you can use the same account any time you to create a new Intacct DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Sage Intacct Advance report you want to run.

Often, the username or password is wrong and the connector will fail. See\n\nPrerequisites\n\nto get the right information.\n\n\n###\n FAQs\n\n\n####\n What endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\n\nThe base URL for Intacct Advanced is\n\nhttps://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml\n\n.\n\n###\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the user id, password, company id, and location id.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nIntacct limits the number of concurrent connections using one company id. The default limit is 2 connections at a time but may vary based on your level of service and contractual terms with Intacct. You need to coordinate the runs of Domo Intacct datasets and other API connections to Intacct outside of Domo, in order to reduce the errors. The best practice is to have one account connection to Domo coordinated by an Intacct administrator, and then grant the access to the account to users needing the datasets. Please spread out scheduled runs of all datasets throughout the 24 hours, and limit unnecessary or duplicate datasets.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nIt is recommended to update the data once a day, but can be updated more frequently if best practices are followed.\n\n###\n What's the difference between the Intacct Advanced connector and the Intacct connector?\n\nThe Intacct Advanced connector allows you to filter the data depending on its creation date or modification date. The Intacct connector allows you to filter the data for the last 30days/90days/6months/12months.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 000005099\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005099\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSage Intacct Advanced connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 3,410\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 1/17/2023, 4:23 AM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 1/17/2023, 5:01 AM\n\n\n"}, "title": "sage_intacct_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
