HubSpot develops software for social media and email marketing, content management, web analytics, and search engine optimization. Use Domo's HubSpot connector to compile reports about your campaigns, contacts, blogs, lead sources, and the like. To learn about the HubSpot API, visit their website (

http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview

).


 The HubSpot connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your HubSpot account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the HubSpot connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

 Using the Domo HubSpot connector
----------------------------------

Follow these step-by-step instructions to configure the Domo HubSpot connector:

. Type "hubspot" in the search bar in the Domo Appstore.

The search result will fetch the relevant connector(s) as shown below.
2. Click on the HubSpot tile.


 The HubSpot connector dashboard will open, displaying the details view for the connector.
3. Click
 **Get the Cards**
 in the upper right corner.

The
 **Connect Data for your Sample App**
 window will pop up. To view your data, you need to connect your HubSpot account to Domo.
4. Click
 **Connect**
 .

You are then taken to the HubSpot OAuth login window.
5. Enter your email address and password associated with your HubSpot account. Alternatively, you can use your Google account or Single sign-on for logging in.


 A list of existing accounts appears, including your own account.
6. Select an account that you want to connect to. In this case, select the account that you logged in with.

The
 **Connect data for your Sample App**
 window pops up. Your selected account appears in the
 **Connect data**
 field along with its Hub ID and App ID.
7. Click
 **Finish**
 .


 The data connecting process will start. It might take a minute to connect.

Once your sample app data is connected, the visual and graphical presentation of the data associated with your account will appear in a dashboard.


 The "Traffic Analytics" section displays collective data about the traffic.

The "Deals" section displays the data related to different deals.

The "Engagements & Contacts" section displays the data about various engagements and contacts altogether.

Best practices
----------------


* Your Hub ID is valid for one account in Domo. Creating an additional account in Domo will cause the original account to be disconnected.
* Some reports are marked as beta. Use at your own risk, as these reports do not currently have any documentation on Hubspot's site and may be removed by Hubspot at any time.

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your HubSpot account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Hub ID. This is located at the bottom of your HubSpot dashboard. For more information, see

http://help.hubspot.com/articles/How\_To\_Doc/How-to-find-your-hub-id

.
* The username and password you use to log into HubSpot.

Connecting to Your HubSpot account
------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the HubSpot Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials pane

This pane contains a single field where you enter your HubSpot Hub ID (see "Prerequisites" above for more details).  You are then taken to the HubSpot OAuth page where you are required to enter the email address and password for your HubSpot account. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new HubSpot DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

##
 Details pane

This pane contains a primary menu in which you select your HubSpot report. One other menu,

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


1. Review the configuration to make sure all required items have been selected.
2. Review the connector history for error messages.
3. To reduce API calls for reports that allow date selections ("Email Events," "Events," "Blog Topics," and "Subscription Timeline"), use
 **Append**
 and choose to pull data from the last successful run instead of all data.
4. In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the time frame that you are trying to pull.
