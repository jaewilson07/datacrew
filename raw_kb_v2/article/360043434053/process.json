Use Domo\u2019s New Relic NRQL connector to pull New Relic data based on an NRQL query. To learn more about the New Relic API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your New Relic account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the New Relic connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to New Relic\u00a0and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A New Relic API account ID. For information about finding your account ID, visit\n\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accou...tup/account-id\n\n.\n* The New Relic API URL. For information about finding your URl, see\n\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/...t-api-v2#appid\n\n.\n* Your New Relic API query key. For information about registering for a query key, see\n\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insig...a-api#register\n\n.\n\nConnecting to Your New Relic Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the New Relic Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your New Relic account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account ID\n  |\n Enter your New Relic API account ID.\n  |\n|\n API URL\n  |\n Enter your New Relic API URL.\n  |\n|\n Query Key\n  |\n Enter your New Relic API query key.\n  |\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\nOnce you have entered valid New Relic credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new New Relic DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains options for pulling your desired report data and configuring the report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter your New Relic NRQL\u00a0query. For information about NRQL query language, see\n\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insig...roduction-nrql\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Timestamp Column Names (Optional)\n  |\n Enter timestamp column names for your report, separating multiple names with commas. The connector recognizes the \"timestamp\" column as epoch even if you do not provide a value here. Enter other column names as necessary to be processed for epoch format changes.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434053\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003515\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNew Relic for NRQL Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,391\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "new_relic_for_nrql_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
