Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nYou can\u00a0create a\u00a0CSV\u00a0DataSet Job\u00a0in Workbench 4. When\u00a0you select\u00a0CSV\u00a0as your\u00a0Data Source\u00a0type, you can specify the\u00a0file path of the CSV data source\u00a0and configure options such as delimiters, missing field handling, etc.\n\n*Note:**\n The CSV file\n *must*\n\n\n* be a text file\n* have data delimited by a single character You can specify the delimiter in\n **Advanced Settings**\n .\n\n*Sample CSV**\n\n\n`Salesperson,ID,March Sales,Quota Reached?\n\n\n \"MacGregor, Sam\",1156724,\"$10,909\",Y\n\n\n \"Orton, Jason\",1156738,\"$6,008\",N\n\n\n \"Butler, Heidi\",1156742,\"$4,321\",N\n\n\n \"Hope, Frank\",1156749,\"$13,888\",Y\n\n\n \"Perez, Katrina\",1156768,\"$11,472\",Y\n\n\n \"Wood, Howard\",1156777,\"$7,446\",N\n\n\n \"Yager, Dorothy\",1156787,\"$3,825\",N\n\n\n \"Jeepers, Adam\",1156796,\"$9,942\",Y\n\n\n \"Pendlesmythe, Ellen\",1156803,\"$14,578\",Y\n\n\n \"Ferrera, Luigi\",1156809,\"$11,239\",Y\n\n\n \"Coulsey, Mason\",1156819,\"$5,213\",N\n\n\n \"Michelsen, Bruce\",1212121,\"$20,250\",Y`\n\n*Training Videos\u00a0- Upload Files with Workbench 4**\n\nLearn how to upload both CSV and Excel files with Workbench 4.\n\n*Part 1 of 4**\n\n*Part 2 of 4**\n\n*Part 3 of 4**\n\n\n**Part 4 of 4**\n\n\n Connecting to CSV Data\n-------------------------\n\n\n**To create a\u00a0CSV\u00a0DataSet Job\u00a0in Workbench 4,**\n\n\n1. Click\n **Add New**\n in the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window.\n\n\n This opens the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**\n .\n2. (Conditional) If requested, select the desired Domo server.\u00a0(This screen only appears if you have more than one server set up in Workbench.)\n3. In the\n **DataSet Job Name**\n field, enter a name for the DataSet Job. This is the name of the\u00a0job as it appears in Workbench,\u00a0not the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.\n4. In the\n **DataSet Name**\n field, enter the name of the DataSet. This is the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.\n5. Select the desired\u00a0update method in the\n **Update Method**\n menu:\n\n\n\t* Select\n\t **Replace DataSet**\n\t if you want the DataSet to be replaced entirely upon updating.\n\t* Select\n\t **Append to DataSet**\n\t if you want\u00a0new data to be added to the existing data set upon updating.\n6. In the\n **Transport Method**\n menu,\u00a0select\n **Local File Provider,**\n**External Process File Provider**\n , or\n **FTP/SFTP File Provider**\n .\n\n\n Descriptions for these transport methods are as follows:\n\nTransport Method\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nLocal File Provider\n\n|\n\nLets you select a file from your machine or a network.\n\n|\n|\n\nExternal Process File Provider\n\n|\n\nLets you\u00a0use\u00a0a\u00a0third-party application to pull data into Domo using a script.\n\n|\n|\n FTP/SFTP File Provider\n  |\n Lets you retrieve a file via FTP, SFTP (SSH-FTP), or FTPS (FTP-SSL)\n  |\n7. Click\n **Next**\n .\n8. In the\n **Data Source**\n menu, select\n **CSV**\n .\n9. In the\n **DataSet Type**\n field, select\u00a0the type of DataSet in the dropdown or enter a custom name.\n\n\n The DataSet type you select\u00a0or enter here is reflected as\u00a0the connector type in Domo after you execute the job.\n\n*Tip:**\n It is recommended that you\u00a0select or enter\u00a0the DataSet type that tells users what data is being represented,\n *not*\n the data reader you are using to present the data. For example, you might be connecting to a CSV file that contains Twitter data.\u00a0In this case the best option would be to enter\u00a0\"Twitter\" rather than selecting\n **CSV**\n because the data you are representing in Domo is from Twitter, not CSV.\n10. (Optional) Enter a description in the\n **DataSet Description**\n field.\n\n*Note:**\n You can change any of the settings you made in the above steps in the\n **Source**\n panel for the DataSet Job after you complete all of the steps in the Wizard\n *except*\n the transport method.\n11. Click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n A new CSV DataSet Job is added to\u00a0the\u00a0list of jobs for the currently authenticated server in the\n **Accounts**\n pane.\n12. Under the\u00a0CSV DataSet Job that was just added to the jobs list, select\n **Source**\n .\n\n\n A panel opens\u00a0with options for configuring your file transport and\u00a0setting options for\u00a0your\u00a0CSV data source.\n13. (Conditional) Do one of the following:\n\n\n\t* If you selected\n\t **Local File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\n\t\t1. Click the ellipsis (...)\u00a0in the\n\t\t **File Path**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Select the desired\u00a0CSV file from\u00a0your machine or network.\n\t* If you selected\n\t **External Process File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\n\t\t1. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t\t **Program Executable**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Select the desired executable file from your machine or network.\n\t\t3. (Optional) Enter arguments in the\n\t\t **Arguments**\n\t\t field, if any.\n\t\t4. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t\t **Output File Path**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t5. Select the desired output file path on your machine or network.\n\n\n\t\t The file type for the output path\n\t\t *must*\n\t\t be CSV.\n\n\n\t\t**Important:**\n\t\t If you are planning to use the Direct Upload option, do not turn on this option until you first rename your destination columns. For more information, see\n\n\t Setting Up Direct Upload in Workbench\n\n\n\t\t .\n\t* If you selected\n\t **FTP/**\n\t**SFTP File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\n\t\t1. Enter the server name in the\n\t\t **Server**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Enter the port number in the\n\t\t **Port**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t3. Enter your server credentials in the\n\t\t **Username**\n\t\t and\n\t\t **Password**\n\t\t fields.\n\t\t4. Select the desired protocol (\n\t\t **FTP**\n\t\t ,\n\t\t **SFTP**\n\t\t , or\n\t\t **FTPS**\n\t\t ).\n\t\t5. (Optional) If you have an SSL certificate (SFTP and FTPS only), configure the settings as necessary.\n\n\n\t\t For more information about these settings, see\n\n\t SFTP\u00a0File Provider\n\n\t .\n\t\t6. In the\n\t\t **Remote File**\n\t\t field, enter the filename for the field you want to import.\n14. Click\n **Apply Changes**\n .\n15. In the\n **Field Delimiters**\n menu, select the radio button for the delimiter used in your CSV file.\u00a0To set a custom delimiter, click the\n **Other**\n radio button then enter the desired delimiter in the field.\n16. In the\n **Encapsulate Fields With**\n field, specify the character used for encapsulating fields.\n17. (Optional) In the\n **Escape Sequence Character**\n field, specify the character used for escaping.\n18. (Optional) In the\n **Comment Character**\n field, select the character used for commenting.\n19. In the\n **Missing Fields Handling**\n section, select the radio button for the desired behavior when missing fields are encountered in your CSV file.\n\nOption\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nGenerate error\n\n|\n\nWorkbench throws an error when missing fields are encountered in the CSV file.\n\n|\n|\n\nReplace with empty values\n\n|\n\nMissing fields in the CSV file are replaced with empty values in your Domo DataSet.\n\n|\n20. If the first row in your cell range contains column headers, leave the box checked; otherwise clear this box. This is important when building cards in Domo because column headers are used to reference the data in those columns. For more information, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n21. If you want Workbench to skip empty lines in your CSV file when sending the data to Domo, check the box for\n **Sanitize data before processing**\n ; otherwise leave it unchecked.\n22. (Optional) In the\n **Ignore starting rows**\n field, specify the number of rows to skip at the beginning of the data so you can start importing a specific row.\n\n\n This does\n *not*\n include the header row containing the column names.\n23. (Optional) In the\n **Ignore ending rows**\n field, specify the number of rows to skip at the end of the data.\n24. In the\n **Text Encoding**\n menu, select the character encoding used in the CSV file.\n\n\n You are now ready to execute the DataSet Job, thereby creating a CSV\u00a0DataSet in Domo. However, there are many other actions you can take on the DataSet job before you send it to Domo. These include the following:\n\n\n* Setting an update schedule for the job\n* Adding the job to a group of jobs with an advanced schedule set in Windows Task Scheduler\n* Configuring notifications to be sent when the job update succeeds or fails\n* Encrypting and decrypting Workbench data\n* Creating new columns using calculations\n* Setting a custom date format on a column\n* Replacing a value in a column\n* Combining DataSets\n* Applying filters to columns\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360047496473\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004781\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nConnecting to CSV Data in Workbench 4\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,703\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "connecting_to_csv_data_in_workbench_4", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
