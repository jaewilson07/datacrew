This is the DataSet that contains the values to create the polices. This is typically a user email and values.\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0The user name or group name. Multiples are separated by the pipe \u2018|\u2019 character.\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0The comparison \u2018value\u2019 in a policy, separated each value with the pipe \u2018|\u2019 character.\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0Currently only the \u2018Equals\u2019 operator is supported.\n* If you want email notifications for\u00a0successes and\u00a0errors, place a properties file in the same directory as the JAR.\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0For email.properties, the\n **user**\n is\n\nuser.name@host.com\n\n, and the\n **host**\n is\u00a0smtp.comcast.com.\n\n\n \u00b7\u00a0For application.properties, the file is\u00a0auto-generated on a successful login. After\n\nyou have logged in successfully, you can run the utility headless.\n\nConfiguration DataSet\n-----------------------\n\nThe following is an example of the configuration DataSet.\n\n*Note:**\n It is very important to order this DataSet by the `target\\_ds` column and then the `policy\\_name` column. This ensures that all the actions happen on the same DataSet and the same policy.\n\n\n**Important:**\n Your configuration DataSet schema should exactly match the following:\n * target\\_ds \u2013 The name or ID of the DataSet where you want to create the policies.\n* policy\\_name \u2013 The human readable policy name.\n* policy\\_column \u2013 The column name that the filter will be created on.\n* user\\_group \u2013 The user name or group name. Multiples are separated by the pipe \u2018|\u2019 character.\n* value \u2013 The value in the filter. Multiples are separated by the pipe \u2018|\u2019 character.\n\n\n To add multiple filters, set the \u2018policy\\_name\u2019 & \u2018user\\_group\u2019 to the same values.\n *Pink highlight.*\n\n\n The utility supports multiple target DataSet in the \u2018target\\_ds\u2019 column.\n *Red & Green highlights.*\n\n\n To add users/groups to the \u2018default\u2019 policy set the \u2018policy\\_column\u2019 & \u2018value\u2019 to \u201cAll Rows\".\n *Purple highlight.*\n\n\n Running the PDP Utility\n-------------------------\n\nThe PDP Utility can be run in one of two modes: standalone GUI or Command Line. First, download the .jar file from\n\nhttps://app.domo.com/labs/pdp/pdputil-3.1.0.jar\n\n.\n\n##\n Standalone GUI\n\nThis is a wizard like interface that will walk you through the creation of the PDP Policies. Double click the PDP.jar or execute from the command line with no params.\n\n\n```\njava -Xmx1024m -jar pdputil-3.1.0.jar\n```\n\n##\n Command Line\n\nThis is a headless utility that can be scripted. Once you have logged in successfully, you can run the utility headless.\n\n\n```\njava -Xmx1024m -jar pdputil-3.1.0.jar <domain> <config_ds>\n```\n\n\n <domain> : The customer instance\n\n\n <config\\_ds> : The name or ID of the \u2018config\u2019 dataset. This is the dataset that contains the key value pairs to create the polices. This is typically a user email and a value.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 000005116\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000005116\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPDP Policy Autocreation\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 1,957\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 2/3/2023, 9:36 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 2/3/2023, 9:37 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "pdp_policy_autocreation", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "working_with_datasets_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan2GAC"}, {"text": "personalized_data_permissions_pdp", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zao2GAC"}]}
