For more information, see\n\nDeleting Cards from Domo\n\n.\n\nYou can also remove a Card from a Page by moving it to another Page. For more information about moving a Card to another Page, see\n\nMoving or Copying Cards to Other Pages\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If a Page has been locked, you can only remove Cards if you are the Page owner or you have an \"Admin\" security role.
