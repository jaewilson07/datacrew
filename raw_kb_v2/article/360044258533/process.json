Supporting functions such as case statements, time-value-money functions, and statistical utility functions, the Add Formula action gives users enhanced functionality to leverage your Magic ETL DataFlows in new ways.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n                            There are significant behavioral differences in Magic ETL.

To overwrite an existing column, use the\n                            \n                            dropdown to view and select an existing column or type the name of that column exactly to overwrite existing column.
