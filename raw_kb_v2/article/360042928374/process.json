Most customers are allowed 2 concurrent requests. However, depending on your service level agreement with Intacct, you may have a greater concurrency limit. If you have a service level agreement that allows for a greater number of concurrent connections, you will need to go into your Domo account in the account center (https://[yourinstance].\n                           \n                            domo.com/datacenter/accounts\n                           \n                           ) and update the value in your Intacct account. Otherwise, Domo will simply default your account to the normal limit of 2 concurrent requests imposed by Intacct.\n                           \n\n                           This change will improve performance and help increase the stability of the Intacct connector. Overall, this should have very little impact on your DataSets, however, the downside of this change is that you may see an increase in the amount of time it takes to get your data into Domo if you do not update your account to reflect the appropriate limit.\n                           \n\n                           Additional steps can be taken to mitigate any potential slowdown by scheduling your Intacct DataSets in such a way that they do not overlap each other.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Intro\n                       \n\n\n                         Intacct helps you manage financials on your own terms with cloud-based accounting software. With Domo, stakeholders can visualize Intacct data together with data from any other system in a real-time dashboard. That means fewer reports for finance and better insights all around.\n                        \n\n\n                         Once your data is in Domo, connect easily to your data and create powerful, dynamic visualizations. Get the up-to-date information you need to make smart decisions on cashflow, ledgers, accounts receivable, accounts payable, journals, P&L, and more. Get real-time alerts via email and text when Intacct metrics hit your predefined levels.\n                        \n                        Use Domo's Intacct connector to retrieve data relating to customers, accounts, invoices, payments, expenses, and the like.

Within your Intacct account you can create custom reports, set them to run on a schedule and have them delivered in a CSV format to a cloud storage service. Intacct supports Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Amazon S3.Once delivered there customers can use the relevant Domo connector to import the custom report from the cloud storage service into Domo.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Primary Use Cases\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            This connector is appropriate for pulling financial reporting and accounting, sales, and inventory data.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Primary Metrics\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Cashflow\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Ledgers\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Accounts receivable\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Accounts payable\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Journals\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Profits and loss\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Primary Company Roles\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CFO\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Accountant\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Sales\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Inventory\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Average Implementation Time\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            Connector runtimes vary based on data, but generally it should take between 2 and 8 hours.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            7\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Best Practices\n                       \n\n                        Keep date ranges reasonable.
