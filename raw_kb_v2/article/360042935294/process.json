For instance, to show financial fluctuations over time, you would want to use a line graph; to compare values, your best choice would be a bar graph; and so on. Choosing the wrong graph type for your data could impair your audience's ability to receive the message, so it is important that you understand when to use the different graph types.\n                       \n\n                        For a list of chart types available in Domo, see\n                        \n                         Available Chart Types\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Information Type Table\n                       \n\n                        There are different types of information represented in charts.
