This is especially useful for Admin-level users who want to be able to view just their own cases instead of the entire list of cases in their Domo instance.\u00a0This walkthrough shows you how to do this.\n\n\n**To create a list in the Customer Portal,**\n\n. Access the Customer Portal through support.domo.com.\n2. In the Portal, click the gear icon in the button bar in the top right corner.\n3. Select\n **New**\n in the gear menu.\n4. Enter a name for the new list.\n5. Leave the default setting of\n **Only I can see this list view**\n .\n6. Click\n **Save**\n .\n7. Add the desired filters.\n\n\n In this example, an Admin sets a filter allowing them to see only the cases they created as a specific user.\n8. Click\n **Done**\n .\n9. Click\n **Save**\n .\n\nYour new list is now created.\n\n\n For more information about the Support Portal, see\n\nGetting Help\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043427533\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004378\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCreating a New List in the Customer Portal\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,691\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:45 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "creating_a_new_list_in_the_customer_portal", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "getting_to_know_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamsGAC"}, {"text": "support_resources", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoIGAS"}]}
