This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SharePoint connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your SharePoint account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password for your SharePoint account.\n* Your SharePoint Windows domain name.
