##
 Multi-Cloud Data Fabric (Beta)

The Multi-Cloud Data Fabric provides a native integration with cross-cloud systems to unlock data products at the speed your business needs them.


**Why Multi-Cloud?**

 IT alone cannot realize the full potential of data in Snowflake. A broad and inclusive approach with all LOBs is required, and not all valuable data is in Snowflake and/or controlled by IT yet.
* Increased stress on, and demands from, data teams. Business users demand access to data products in a timely manner, increasing pressure to deliver.​
* Rigidity and friction in data processes. Rigid processes and tooling prevent the building of databases in a speedy and flexible manner. Taking too much time and too much effort.

Multi-Cloud can help with these needs and more.
