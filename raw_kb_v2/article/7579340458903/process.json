You can now add DDX Bricks right from your Dashboard editor, so you no longer have to go back and forth from the Appstore to your Dashboard - you are able to stay in context with the rest of your Dashboard content while adding Cards from the Appstore.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nDrag-and-Drop Apps\n\n.\n\n##\n Preview Page Breaks in Dashboards\n\nWith Page Breaks in Dashboards, you can now see when your content is getting too large to export.

A broad and inclusive approach with all LOBs is required, and not all valuable data is in Snowflake and/or controlled by IT yet.\n* Increased stress on, and demands from, data teams. Business users demand access to data products in a timely manner, increasing pressure to deliver.\u200b\n* Rigidity and friction in data processes. Rigid processes and tooling prevent the building of databases in a speedy and flexible manner. Taking too much time and too much effort.\n\nMulti-Cloud can help with these needs and more.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nMulti-Cloud Data Fabric\n\n.\n\n##\n Domo for Office Add-Ins (Beta)\n\nDomo for Office Add-Ins allow for a direct connection to Domo within Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook so that you can import live and always up-to-date Domo visualizations and Datasets directly into Office documents.This enables you to utilize the Domo platform right in the Microsoft Office Suite, enables greater adoption rates, and opens a world of possibility for success with Domo.\n\n\n But we\u2019ve done much, much more than just provide the ability to quickly insert a Card into an email, we mean it when we say that you can even manage your Domo DataSets and Cards, as well as create new Projects and Tasks, send Buzz messages, and even import data into Domo\u2014all from within the Microsoft Office Suite. These add-ins are supported on Windows, Mac, and Office Online platforms.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nDomo for Office Add-Ins (Beta)\n\n.\n\n\n New Grants\n------------\n\nGrants that have been added for use in custom roles in this release include the following:\n\n##\n Receive Domo System Messages\n\nReceive Domo system messages about maintenance and feature updates. Ensure at least one Admin receives these messages.\n\n\n Getting help\n--------------\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by selecting the Help Center in\u00a0the top navigation bar.\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://domo.com/university/\n* search for training apps in the Appstore\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\nhttps://dojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support by entering a help ticket in the Domo Support Portal\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo (\n **More\u00a0> Feedback**\n ).
