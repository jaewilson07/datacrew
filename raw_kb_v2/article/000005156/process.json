The first shows sales versus budget data as a simple two-line chart, while the second shows the same data as a variance chart.\u00a0Notice that the variance chart highlights the delta, or difference, data. This is useful when you want to analyze differences between lines.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Powering Variance Charts\n                       \n\n                        A variance chart requires a `Date` field and an `Actual` value. Although not required, a `Target` value is key to emphasizing the power of the chart.\u00a0For information about value, category, and series data, see our article about\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In Analyzer, you can choose the columns containing the data for your variance chart.
