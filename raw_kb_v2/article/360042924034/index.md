Intro
-------

In the Analyzer view for a Visualization card (sometimes called the "Card Builder" or "Edit" view), you customize the appearance of your charts


 and apply DataSet columns to a chart. You can also apply and edit filters, chart properties, sorts, chart name and descripti


 on, as well as view and manipulate the data table for the chart.


 The Analyzer appears as part of the workflow for creating a Visualization card. For more information, see

Visualization Card Building Part 1: Powering Your Card

.


 Analyzer is only accessible by users with "Admin," "Privileged," or "Editor" default security roles OR a custom security role with the "Edit Cards" privilege enabled. For more information about default security roles, see

Managing Roles

 Provides access to data configuration options for the chart, including the following:
 * **DataSet picker**
 . Lets you change the DataSet powering this chart.

* **Available columns**
 . Shows the columns from this DataSet that you can apply to your chart. These are divided into
 **Measures**
 (columns that contain items with a "value" data type) and
 **Dimensions**

You apply columns to your chart by dragging and dropping them from this area into the column fields above the chart preview area.


 If the column names are too long to fit, you can expand the pane by clicking and dragging on the border of the right side of the pane.
