The Appstore is composed of a main page divided into\u00a0several tabs, as follows:\n\n\n Name\n  |\n Icon\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Home\n  |  |\n Shows you featured apps, QuickStarts, new and trending apps, and connectors.\n  |\n|\n Search\n  |  |\n Lets you search for specific Appstore content using a variety of filters and search options.\n  |\n|\n Installed\n  |  |\n Shows all apps that have been installed in your Domo\u00a0instance.\n  |\n|\n Asset Library\n  |  |\n Shows both pending and live apps you have created as well as custom app designs.\n  |\n|\n Store Manager\n  |  |\n Allows you to see all apps that have been pushed to publication and choose whether to grant or deny publication for apps in this list.

For more information about connectors, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You are not limited to one version of an app per company Domo instance. For example, multiple users could each have their own version of the Facebook\u00a0QuickStart app. Each user's individual version of the Facebook\u00a0QuickStart app would contain cards powered up by his or her personal Facebook data.\n\n\n \u200bAppstore tabs\n----------------\n\nThis section discusses each of the tabs in the Appstore.\n\n##\n Home\u00a0tab\n\nThe\n **Home**\n tab contains a carousel of recommended apps you can navigate through.
