The difference is that it also includes one or more trendlines and two y-axes, similar to other kinds of line-bar combination charts.\u00a0One of these is used to measure the values along the line(s), and the other is used to measure the percentages of the bars in each stack. By default, the first item that appears in your chart legend is represented as the line and all remaining items are represented as stacks of bars. You can change this behavior in the Chart Properties if you want.\n                       \n\n                        Both vertical and horizontal versions of 100% stacked bar with line charts are available. In vertical 100% stacked bar with line charts, series in categories are \"stacked\" on top of each other; in horizontal 100% stacked bar charts, the series appear side by side.\n                       \n\n                        Powering 100% stacked bar with line charts\n                       \n\n                        A 100% stacked bar with line chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values.

By default, the first series that appears in your legend for these chart types becomes a line, and all remaining series become bars. However, you can convert series from bars to lines by entering the desired number of lines in\n                           \n                            Chart Properties\n                           \n                           . For example, if your chart had three series, the first series appearing in your legend would appear as a line, and the remaining two series would appear as bars. You could turn the second series into a line by entering\n                           \n                            2\n                           \n                           in the\n                           \n                            Series on Left Scale\n                           \n                           field.\n                          \n\n                           \u2014\n                          \n\n\n\n                           General > Line Style\n                          \n\n\n                            Lets you change the line style in your chart.
