In the

Profile

page, you have the ability to connect to any of a number of social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. When you connect to a social network, a feed for that social network appears at the bottom of the

Profile

page. Visitors to your

Profile

can view your social activity and photos for each network. Feeds may also provide options such as marking posts as Favorites, "retweeting," linking to Instagram photos, and so on. You can also disconnect from a social network.

Profile

page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, a

icon appears instead.)
2. Click

in the navigation bar under the profile header.
