Use Domo's CA Agile Central connector to retrieve data about projects and tasks, users, defects, and the like. For more information about the CA Agile Central API, go to\n                        \n                         https://help.rallydev.com/access-web-services-api-wsapi\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        The CA Agile Central connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud.

These\u00a0may replace some of the standard fields, which adds complexity.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              API documentation is difficult to access and follow.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            7\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Best Practices\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Forecast and track progress: The states of the scheduled work items indicate the progress of your development as it moves to completion. To determine if you are on target to complete the work within the scheduled iteration, track the accepted state.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Manage scope: As your scheduled work item bars become level, it is easy to see when excess work is added to an iteration. If the level of the bars do not remain uniform and instead continue to increase, you need to re-address the scope of your iteration.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Identify bottlenecks: Use the rolled-up states of your scheduled work items to determine if there are trends that indicate bottlenecks. For example, a large section of scheduled items in a completed state as compared to a small amount of accepted may indicate a testing roadblock.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        To connect to your CA Agile Central account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The API key for your CA Agile Central account.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The URL for your CA Agile Central account (for example,\n                          \n\n\n\n                              https://rally1.rallydev.com\n                             \n\n\n\n                          ).\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Connecting to Your CA Agile Central Account\n                       \n\n                        This section enumerates the options in the\n                        \n\n                          Credentials\n                         \n\n                        and\n                        \n\n                          Details\n                         \n\n                        panes in the CA Agile Central Connector page.
