To learn\u00a0more about the\u00a0Pipedrive API, visit their website (\n\nhttps://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/\n\n).\n\n\n The Pipedrive connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Pipedrive\u00a0account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Pipedrive\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Tracking and monitoring your entire sales pipeline.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Sales\n* Leads\n* Sales conversion rates\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Analytics and sales roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nUsing reports that do NOT require specific IDs will generally make life easier.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Pipedrive account and create a DataSet, you must have a Pipedrive API key. You can find\u00a0the API key for your account by doing the following:\n\n. Log into Pipedrive using your username and password.\n2. Click your username in the top right corner and select\n **Settings**\n .\n3. Select\n **API**\n .\n\nYour API token appears on the screen.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Pipedrive Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Pipedrive Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains a single field in which you can enter your Pipedrive API token. For more information about finding your token, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have entered a valid API token, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Pipedrive DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n*Accounts**\n\ntab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a\n\nReport\n\nmenu in which you can select a\u00a0Pipedrive report type.\u00a0Other menus and fields may appear, depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Pipedrive report.
