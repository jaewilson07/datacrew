To learn more about the AppNexus API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         https://wiki.appnexus.com/display/documentation/APIs\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        The AppNexus API will get you access to the reporting API for the Ad Delivery and Campaign Management environment. From here you'll be able to get reporting on your campaigns by a number of dimensions and metrics. Virtually any metric or dimension available by the AppNexus Web Console will be allowed via the API.\n                       \n\n                        You connect to your AppNexus account in the Data Center.

If you must use the Custom Reporting and JSON text box, you should have a good knowledge of JSON API calls. It is suggested you use the console to ensure the metrics you are attempting to select in JSON work well together.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          If you intend to append the report each day, it is suggested you just pull yesterday's data and schedule the report to run daily.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        To connect to your AppNexus account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password you use to log into the\n                        \n                         AppNexus Console\n                        \n                        .
