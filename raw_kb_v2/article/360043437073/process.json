Use Domo's Salesforce\u00a0Writeback connector to export your data from a Domo DataSet to your Salesforce account.\n\n\n To learn more about the Salesforce API, visit any of the following:\n\n https://www.salesforce.com/developer/docs/api/\n* http://resources.docs.salesforce.com/200/9/en-us/sfdc/pdf/salesforce\\_field\\_names\\_reference.pdf\n* https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/data\\_model.htm\n\nYou can push DataSet data to Salesforce\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Salesforce\u00a0Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you must have a\u00a0Domo Client ID and Client Secret. To obtain these credentials, do the following:\n\n. Log into your Domo developer account at\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/login\n\n.\n2. Create a new client\n\n.\n3. Select the desired data and user application scope.\n4. Click\n ********Create********\n .\n5. Customers can go directly to the package with the following link:\n\nhttps://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1I000001ymKN\n6. If you are installing into a sandbox organization you must replace the initial portion of the URL with\n\nhttp://test.salesforce.com\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n pane\u00a0in the Salesforce Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account.\u00a0The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Salesforce Environment\n  |\n Select the desired Salesforce environment.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.\n  |\n\nAfter you connect, you are taken to the Salesforce\u00a0OAuth screen where you are prompted to enter your Salesforce\u00a0username and password.\n\nOnce you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Salesforce Writeback\u00a0connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\nThis pane contains four sections for selecting and configuring the data you want to send to Salesforce.\n\n###\n Writeback\u00a0Type\n\nHere, you can choose whether you want to insert data from a Domo DataSet into a) an existing Salesforce table, or b) a new table. If you select the first option, your Salesforce objects are populated automatically in the\n **Salesforce Setup**\n section of the\n **Details**\n pane and you can choose the one you want to push data to. If you select the second option, you are prompted to define the Salesforce object\u00a0in the\n **Salesforce Setup**\n section of the\n **Details**\n pane.\n\n###\n Domo DataSet\n\nEnter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to Salesforce. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\u00a0datasources/.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The Salesforce Writeback Connector looks for a\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n column. If this column is present in the input DataSet, the Connector will keep track of the highest\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n in the source DataSet to keep track of the data already written to Salesforce. For the next run the Connector will only write rows with a\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n higher than the one recorded on previous runs. This is to avoid writing duplicate data to Salesforce. If the\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n column is not present in the source DataSet, all the data will be written to Salesforce every time the Connector runs.\n\n\n####\n Salesforce Setup\n\nIf you selected\n **Insert Data in Existing Table**\n in the\n **Writeback Type**\n section, your Salesforce objects appear here automatically and you can choose the one you want to push data to. If you selected\n **Insert Data in New Table**\n in the\n **Writeback Type**\n section, you are prompted to enter the following here:\n\n The Salesforce internal object name (without spaces)\n* An object label (display label) for the new Salesforce object\n* A plural display label for the new Salesforce object\n\n\n####\n Configuration Mapping\n\nHere, you will match columns from your Domo DataSet with the desired Salesforce field.\n\n\n For required Salesforce fields, select the correct DataSet column.\n\n\n For optional fields, match the desired Salesforce fields and DataSet columns.\n\n##\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043437073\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004026\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSalesforce Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,125\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:18 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "salesforce_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
