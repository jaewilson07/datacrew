Intro

 Harvest provides time tracking and online invoicing tools and services for freelancers and small businesses. The Domo HarvestApp connector allows you to get your Harvest data into Domo and begin analyzing data to optimize hiring and invoicing decisions.

To learn more about the Harvest API, visit their page (

http://help.getharvest.com/api/

).


 You connect to your Harvest account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the HarvestApp connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Harvest account and create a DataSet, you must have your Harvest username and password. Alternatively, you can use your Google account to login.


 Connecting to Your Harvest Account
------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the HarvestApp Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo HarvestApp connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Harvest accounts in Domo) to open the Harvest OAuth screen where you can enter your Harvest username and password. (You can also enter Google credentials to authenticate.) Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new HarvestApp DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Harvest when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Harvest.

####
 What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?

You need your Harvest email id and password, or Google account credentials to power up this connector.

###
 How do I know my login credentials are secure?

The login process uses the OAuth process, so your credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.

###
 Can I use the same account multiple times to create datasets?

Yes

###
 When I click 'Add Account', why am I getting automatically validated without needing to enter credentials?

If you are already logged into Harvest when you connect to Domo, you are authenticated automatically as you click Add account. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Harvest.

###
 How often can the data be updated?

As often as needed.

###
 Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?

Harvest limits 100 requests per 15 seconds.
