Once in place, you can make changes in a controlled development location and then promote the changes to update production. Creating a linked repository is intended to be a one-time process for moving production content into a development environment. After you create a linked repository, we recommend only promoting from development to production.\n                        \n\n                        For more general information about Sandbox, see\n                        \n                         Domo Sandbox.\n                        \n\n\n                        Key Terms\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Term\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Description\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Production Instance\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The destination instance where the dashboards and/or DataFlows currently exist.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Development Instance\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The source instance where the dashboards and/or DataFlows are populated and used as a source of Sandbox.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating a Linked Repository\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Before creating a linked repository, ensure that relationships between instances are established.
