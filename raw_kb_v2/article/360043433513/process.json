To learn more about\u00a0the\u00a0PagerDuty API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://developer.pagerduty.com/documentation/rest\n\n).\n\n\n The PagerDuty\u00a0V2 connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0V2 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account and create a DataSet, you must have the API key for your\u00a0PagerDuty account. For information about generating a PagerDuty API key, see\n\nhttps://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202829310-Generating-an-API-Key\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0PagerDuty Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0V2 Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0PagerDuty account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the\u00a0API Key\u00a0for your\u00a0PagerDuty account.\u00a0For information about generating a PagerDuty API key, see\n\nhttps://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202829310-Generating-an-API-Key\n\n.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0PagerDuty credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0PagerDuty\u00a0V2 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary\u00a0menu from which you can select a report, along with various other fields and menus that may or may not appear depending on your selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0PagerDuty report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Abilities\n  |\n Retrieves all abilities for your account.\n  |\n|\n Addons\n  |\n Retrieves all of the add-ons installed in your account.\n  |\n|\n Escalation Policies\n  |\n Retrieves all existing escalation policies.\n  |\n|\n Extensions\n  |\n Retrieves all existing extensions.\n  |\n|\n Incident Alerts\n  |\n Retrieves alerts for the specified incident.\n  |\n|\n Incident Log Entries\n  |\n Returns log entries for a specified incident.\n  |\n|\n Incident Notes\n  |\n Retrieves\u00a0existing notes for a specified incident.\n  |\n|\n Incidents\n  |\n Retrieves existing incidents.\n  |\n|\n Log Entries\n  |\n Retrieves all incident log entries across the entire account.\n  |\n|\n Maintenance Windows\n  |\n Retrieves existing maintenance windows.\n  |\n|\n Notifications\n  |\n Returns all existing notifications across the entire account.\n  |\n|\n On-Calls\n  |\n Returns all on-call entries for the account.\n  |\n|\n Schedule Overrides\n  |\n Retrieves overrides for a given time range.\n  |\n|\n Schedules\n  |\n Retrieves existing on-call schedules.\n  |\n|\n Schedules Users\n  |\n Returns a list of all users on call in a given schedule.\n  |\n|\n Services\n  |\n Retrieves existing services.\n  |\n|\n Teams\n  |\n Returns all teams on your account.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Retrieves existing users.\n  |\n|\n Vendors\n  |\n Retrieves all vendors on the account.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Query (Optional)\n  |\n Enter a term to filter the results of your\u00a0report.\n  |\n|\n User ID(s) (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the ID(s) of the user(s) you want to retrieve information for. Separate multiple IDs with commas.\n  |\n|\n Team IDs (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the ID(s) of the team(s) you want to retrieve information for. Separate multiple IDs with commas. The account must have the \"Teams\" ability enabled for this option to work.\n  |\n|\n Sort By\n  |\n Choose how you want to sort the data in your report, either by name, ascending name, or descending name.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether the data in this report is for a single specified date or for the past month.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0data is for a specific\u00a0or relative date.\u00a0Choose\n **Relative**\n if you always want the report to\u00a0retrieve data for a\u00a0given number of days back (which you specify in\n **Date Offset**\n ) from the current date. For example, if you enter\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Date Offset**\n and set the\u00a0DataSet to update\u00a0daily, each\u00a0new day the report will update to show information for the date 5 days in the past.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Date Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of days back from the current date that will be presented in the report.\n  |\n|\n Date Granularity\n  |\n Select whether you want report data to be shown by day, week, or month.\n  |\n|\n Policy Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the policy you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Policy ID\n  |\n Enter ID of the policy you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Incident ID\n  |\n Enter the ID of the incident you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Date Range\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for all time or for a selected date range.

You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Incident ID\n  |\n Select the ID of the incident you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Schedule ID\n  |\n Enter the ID of the schedule you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Time Zone\n  |\n Select the time zone for the dates in your report.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433513\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003566\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPagerDuty V2 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,362\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "pagerduty_v2_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
