This project contains only the three basic task lists\u2014\"To Do,\" \"Working On,\" and \"Completed.\" Any tasks you have assigned that are in custom-made lists are pulled into the appropriate basic list. (For example, if you had created a list called \"Ideas\" based on the basic \"To Do\" list, the tasks from \"Ideas\" would be pulled into \"To Do\" in the \"Tasks That You Have Assigned\" project.)
