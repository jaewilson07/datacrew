Intro

Using the

Projects & Tasks

tool in Domo, you can create projects made up of various tasks and assign users to complete those tasks. There are several types of projects—"Personal Tasks," which are tasks you create that are
 *only*
 seen by you; "My Projects," which are projects to which you are assigned as a team member; and "Company Projects," which are tasks assigned to all teams, whether or not you are a member. Company projects can be made public or private. Public company projects can be viewed, accessed, and edited by anyone in your company, and private company projects can only be viewed by members of the team assigned to that project.

The page also contains a project named "Tasks That You Have Assigned," which contains all tasks you have assigned to other users. This project contains only the three basic task lists—"To Do," "Working On," and "Completed." Any tasks you have assigned that are in custom-made lists are pulled into the appropriate basic list. (For example, if you had created a list called "Ideas" based on the basic "To Do" list, the tasks from "Ideas" would be pulled into "To Do" in the "Tasks That You Have Assigned" project.) For more information about lists, see

Adding a Task List to a Project

.


 All projects you are able to access in Domo appear in your main

Projects & Tasks

page, which you can access by clicking

in the top right corner of the screen. You can click the name of any project here—including your Personal Tasks—to open a details page for that project.


 For more information about Projects and Tasks, see

Project Listing page
----------------------

The project listing page is the first page you see when you click

. This page lists all of the projects you have access to. Projects are divided into these lists—"Personal Tasks" (which only you can view and access); "My Projects" (projects to which you have been assigned as a team member); "Company Projects" (all projects you are allowed to view, including those which have been marked as "Public"), and "Tasks That You Have Assigned," which combines all of the tasks you have assigned to others from all projects.


 The following screenshot shows the most important components of this page:

The following table describes these components in greater detail:

Project Details page
----------------------

When you click on any project in the project listing page, a details page for that project appears. This page shows the number of open and closed tasks for the project, the due date, the team members, and workflow lists for the project. Every project you create initially contains three task workflow lists—"To Do," "Working On," and "Completed"—but you can create new lists if you want. You can assign tasks to workflow lists, move tasks between lists, or even move the lists themselves.


 The following screenshot shows the most important components of this page:

The following table describes these components in greater detail:


 Component
  |
 Description
  |
| --- | --- |
|
 Privacy indicator

 Indicates whether this project has been set to "public" or "private." If the project is private, a lock icon like the one shown here appears; if the project is public, nothing appears here.
  |

  |

 Shows you the number of open and closed tasks in this project, the due date, and the team members assigned to the project. This information is found in the filter panel, so you do not see it if the panel is closed.
  |
|
 Task tags
  |
 Allow you to filter tasks based on tags you add when you create a task. For example, in the previous screenshot, the user added the tag "doc" to all of the tasks that involve creating documentation, so the "doc" tag appears here. If the user then clicks "doc," the tasks in the project are filtered to show only the tasks with the "doc" tag. For more information about creating tasks, see

Creating and Assigning Project Tasks

. Task tags are found in the filter panel, so you do not see them if the panel is closed.

 **Edit project**
 dialog opens, with the list of users open by default so you can quickly select the new team member you want.

|
 Assign Task button

  |
|
 Task lists
  |
 The columns that show the progress of tasks in a project. All projects start with these lists—"To Do," "Working On," and "Completed." You can add new lists using the New List button; however, all new lists you create are based on one of the three basic list types.


 You can move tasks between lists as often as you want.


 You can add tasks to any list by entering the task name in the empty field under the appropriate list or by clicking the
 **New Task**
 button and filling out the task information there (tasks created in this way are automatically sent to the "To Do" list). You can move lists, archive all of the tasks in a list, or archive the lists themselves by mousing over the top of the list and selecting the desired option from the

menu that appears. You can click and drag tasks between lists, or click any task to bring up a dialog with additional options for that task. Finally, you can "like" a task by clicking the

icon.


 A

icon on a task indicates that the task contains one or more attachments. A
