Intro
-------

A slope chart visualizes data from a given time period based on the period's start and end points. By simplifying the data into lines, this chart type allows you to focus on relevant information rather than the clutter of intermediate data points.


 Powering Slope Charts
------------------------

A slope chart requires a date field and a value field. You then select the start and end points from a variety of predefined options. The chart can also include other dimensions for multiple lines per dimension.
