Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Tumblr accounts in Domo) to open the Tumblr OAuth screen where you can enter your Tumblr\u00a0credentials. Once you have entered valid Tumblr credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Tumblr DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Tumblr when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Tumblr.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the (third-party connector) report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Blog-Followers\n  |\n Retrieves a blog's followers.\n  |\n|\n Blog-Likes\n  |\n Retrieves the publicly exposed likes from a blog.\n  |\n|\n Posts-Draft\n  |\n Retrieves draft posts.\n  |\n|\n Posts-Queued\n  |\n Retrieves queued posts.\n  |\n|\n Posts-Submission\n  |\n Retrieves submission posts.\n  |\n|\n Posts-Tagged\n  |\n Retrieves posts with tag.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-All\n  |\n Retrieves published posts.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Answer\n  |\n Retrieves information for answer posts, such as blog name, URL, question and answer.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Audio\n  |\n Retrieves information for audio posts, such as caption, player, plays, artist and more.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Chat\n  |\n Retrieves information for chat posts, such as title, body and dialogue.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Link\n  |\n Retrieves information for link posts, such as, title, URL, author and more.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Photo\n  |\n Retrieves information for photo posts, such as, photos, captions, and more.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Quote\n  |\n Retrieves information for quote posts, such as text and source.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Text\n  |\n Retrieves information for text posts, such as title and body.\n  |\n|\n Published Posts-Video\n  |\n Retrieves information for video posts, such as\u00a0caption and player.\n  |\n|\n User Info\n  |\n Retrieve the user's account information that matches the OAuth credentials submitted with the request.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Host Name\n  |\n Enter the unique host name of the Tumblr blog site you want to retrieve information for.
