With Sybase Partition connector,\u00a0see your SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise data together with the data from other systems, all in Domo. Use partitioning to manage large tables and indexes by dividing them into smaller, more manageable pieces.\u00a0Use Domo's\u00a0Sybase Partition\u00a0connector to get your SAP ASE data into Domo based on the number of past days provided. To learn more about SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.sap.com/products/sybase-ase.html#\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sybase Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your SAP ASE account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise account\n* The host name for the database\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n* CA certificate text or URL path is required\n **only**\n if you select\n ****Certificate text****\n or\n ****URL path****\n ,\u00a0respectively, in the\n ****Certificate type****\n menu.\n\nBefore you can connect to a\u00a0SAP\u00a0database, you must also white list a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to.

The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise account username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise account password.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the SAP database.
