Intro
-------

A Stacked Area chart is a multi-line

Stacked Bar Chart

. The total size of the area for each segment reflects the cumulative value of all data items in that category.


 A Stacked Area chart is similar to a standard Area chart; however, in a Stacked Area chart, all segments are shown at once, either side by side or on top of each other, whereas in a standard Area chart, all segments have the same baseline and therefore overlap.


 Subtypes
----------

Stacked Area charts have a number of subtypes, including all of the following:

 Vertical Curved Stacked Area
* Vertical Step Stacked Area
* Horizontal Curved Stacked Area
* Horizontal Step Stacked Area
* Vertical 100% Stacked Area
* Vertical 100% Curved Stacked Area
* Vertical 100% Step Stacked Area
* Horizontal 100% Stacked Area
* Horizontal 100% Curved Stacked Area
* Horizontal 100% Step Stacked Area

For explanations and screenshots for these subtypes, see

 Powering Stacked Area charts
------------------------------

Stacked Area charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet—one for categories (generally dates), one for series in those categories, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see

 In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Stacked Area chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see
