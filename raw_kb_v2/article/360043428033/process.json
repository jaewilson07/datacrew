The total size of the area for each segment reflects the cumulative value of all data items in that category.\n\n\n A Stacked Area chart is similar to a standard Area chart; however, in a Stacked Area chart, all segments are shown at once, either side by side or on top of each other, whereas in a standard Area chart, all segments have the same baseline and therefore overlap.\n\n\n Subtypes\n----------\n\nStacked Area charts have a number of subtypes, including all of the following:\n\n Vertical Curved Stacked Area\n* Vertical Step Stacked Area\n* Horizontal Curved Stacked Area\n* Horizontal Step Stacked Area\n* Vertical 100% Stacked Area\n* Vertical 100% Curved Stacked Area\n* Vertical 100% Step Stacked Area\n* Horizontal 100% Stacked Area\n* Horizontal 100% Curved Stacked Area\n* Horizontal 100% Step Stacked Area\n\nFor explanations and screenshots for these subtypes, see\n\nAvailable Chart Types\n\n.\n\n\n Powering Stacked Area charts\n------------------------------\n\nStacked Area charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories (generally dates), one for series in those categories, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your Stacked Area chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization\u00a0Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\nThe following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a horizontal Stacked Area chart:\n\n\n Customizing Stacked Area charts\n---------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a Stacked Area chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . For information about all chart properties, see\n\nChart Properties\n\n. Unique properties of Stacked Area charts include the following:\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n General > Style\n  |\n Determines the style for a Stacked Area chart, either \"Flat,\" \"Folded,\" \"Curved\" or \"Step.\" The default style of the chart depends on the specific subtype you have selected. If you select \"Folded,\" the chart takes on a 3-D appearance, as shown in the example at right.\n  |  |\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043428033\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004751\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nStacked Area Chart\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,791\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:29 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "stacked_area_chart", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
