Python SDKs can be used to do data analysis outside of Domo. Customers can use Python SDKs to pull DataSets outside of Domo and use Python’s data science libraries for their analysis work. This can also be used if a customer wants to pull data out of Domo and do another API call to merge the two DataSets or do comparisons.


 The Python SDK examples and content are found here:
