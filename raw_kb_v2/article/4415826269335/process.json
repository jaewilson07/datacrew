The DataSet created on the second instance is a virtual DataSet. Virtual DataSets are DataSets linked to the original DataSets, receiving new data and schema changes in real-time as the primary DataSet receives them.\n                       \n\n                        Alongside Domo Sandbox, this will allow for DataSets to be shared from the Prod instance down into the Dev or Testing instance.\n                       \n\n                        Accessing the toolkit\n                       \n\n                        The\n                        \n                         Governance Toolkit\n                        \n                        can be found in the\n                        \n                         Admin\n                        \n                        section of Domo, under\n                        \n                         Governance\n                        \n                        then\n                        \n                         Toolkit\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n                         https://{INSTANCE}.domo.com/admin/governance-toolkit/virtual-dataset-sharing\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           If the tool you wish to use is not enabled, please reach out to your Account Executive.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        If you are unable to find the Toolkit, ensure your user role has the\n                        \n                         required grants\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The default view of the Virtual DataSet Sharing tool will be a list of existing DataSet sharing jobs.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Required Grants\n                       \n\n                        To access the Governance Toolkit a user will need 1 of 2 grants enabled for a user.
