You can use the Vimeo connector to retrieve data about videos, people, albums, and the like.\u00a0To learn more about the Vimeo API, go to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/api/start\n\n.\n\n\n The Vimeo connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Vimeo connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Accessing data about video performance, effectiveness, completion, and general information about your viewers\n* Providing insight into campaign effectiveness from a product marketing standpoint\n* Helping marketers\u00a0understand their end audience better\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Video views\n* Video comments\n* Geo-location of viewing events\n* Video completion\n* Video fallout\n* Source by device type\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Product marketing roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Vimeo account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you entered when you signed up for a Vimeo account.\n* Your Vimeo password.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Vimeo Account\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Vimeo Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Vimeo connector uses OAuth to connect. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Vimeo accounts in Domo)\n\n\n to open the\u00a0Vimeo OAuth screen where you can either enter the email address associated with your Vimeo account and your password or you can enter your Facebook credentials.\u00a0After you have entered valid\u00a0credentials and authorized Domo to access Vimeo, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Vimeo DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0Vimeo when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Vimeo.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a single menu from which you select a Vimeo report.\u00a0The following table describes all of the reports you can create using the Domo\u00a0Vimeo connector:\n\n\n Report\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Albums\n  |\n Returns a list of the authenticated user's albums.\n  |\n|\n Categories\n  |\n Returns a list of Vimeo categories.\n  |\n|\n Channels\n  |\n Returns a list of all public channels.\n  |\n|\n Contacts\n  |\n Returns a list of the authenticated user's contacts.\n  |\n|\n Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of the authenticated user's member groups.\n  |\n|\n People\n  |\n Returns information about the authenticated user.\n  |\n|\n Videos\n  |\n Returns a list of all videos credited to the authenticated user.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Ensure that your credentials correspond to the account where the videos are hosted.\n* Ensure that data is updating at the desired frequency.\n* Compare to Vimeo channel data by manually extracting from the Vimeo site.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042931214\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003341\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nVimeo Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,659\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "vimeo_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
