Intro
---------

Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a means by which publishers of content offer feeds to their consumers. Using the Domo RSS Connector, you can retrieve data from any content provider using the standard RSS format and integrate it into Domo.


 The RSS connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You create an RSS DataSet in the
