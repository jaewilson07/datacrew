The Profit and Loss app allows users to view their financial statements all in one app. In the app, you can customize which type of reports you want to see and the order of these reports by editing the included Domo WebForms. Multiple metrics in the app include App Mode, Date Grain, Period, and Year. These metrics, which are selected by you and are applied to the app, allow you to view your financial statements as necessary for your business needs.

The Profit and Loss app includes a date filtering option for you to quickly and easily view your data in different time periods. Display up to seven depth levels in your data hierarchy.

Parts of the Profit and Loss App
----------------------------------

The Profit and Loss app is all contained within one main view but includes several different metric-filtering options, including App Mode, Date Grain, Time Period type, Year, and collapsible statement sections.

##
 Main View

The Profit and Loss app's main view is set to whatever your last viewing state was, so if you leave the app with certain metrics selected and sections un-collapsed, that would be the state you'd see when the app opens again. The selectable metrics in the app include App Mode, Date Grain, Time Period type (based upon what Date Grain you've selected), and Year. The Trended App Mode includes a # of Period(s) metric as well. The Apply Filters button applies all the selected filters to the app. If any sections are un-collapsed, then the Collapse All button closes all opened sections.
