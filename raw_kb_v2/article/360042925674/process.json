In the Sumo builder view, you can lay out this table data in either or both of these formats. In the builder view, you have access to two sub-views:\n                        \n                         Column View\n                        \n                        , in which you can build a column-based table, and\n                        \n                         Pivot View\n                        \n                        , in which you can build a pivot table similar to that found in Microsoft Excel. Both sub-views contain various options for hiding and showing columns; aggregating and filtering data; and so on. You can manipulate tables in each view independently. The view that is selected when you save your table is the view that appears in this Sumo Card in the Page view.\n                       \n\n                        This topic lays out the overall steps for creating a Sumo Card in both views and\u00a0discusses many of the options in more detail (such as sorting, filtering, etc.).\n                       \n\n                        For information about the interface components of the edit view for a Sumo Card, including a discussion of both the column and pivot views, see\n                        \n                         Sumo Editor Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Creating a Sumo Card\n                       \n\n                        You can create a Sumo Card in the standard Column view or the more complex Pivot view.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - How to Create a Sumo Card\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Video - Building a Sumo Pivot Table\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Creating a Sumo Card in Column View\n                       \n\n                        The most straightforward way to create a Sumo Card is building a column-based version in\n                        \n                         Column View\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         To create a Sumo Card in Column View,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Navigate to the Page where you want the Sumo Card to appear.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                          in the upper right corner of the Page.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select\n                          \n                           Create new Card\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Tip:\n                              \n\n                             You can also open this dialog from anywhere in Domo by selecting\n                             \n                             in the app toolbar and selecting\n                             \n                              Card\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Select\n                          \n                           Sumo\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n\n                          The edit view appears, with\n                          \n                           Column View\n                          \n                          selected by default.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Enter a name for this Sumo Card by clicking in the title text field and typing in the name you want.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Enter a description for this Sumo Card by clicking in the \"Add Card Description\" text and typing in the description you want.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Select the DataSet that will power up this Sumo Card by doing the following:\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Click\n                            \n                             Select DataSet\n                            \n                            .\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Select the connector type for this DataSet.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Select the DataSet.\n                            \n\n                             Column View\n                            \n                            for this DataSet appears, with a number of columns from the DataSet applied to your table by default (including\n                            \n                             Beast Mode\n                            \n                            columns that have been attached to this DataSet).\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          (Optional) Add or remove columns to/from your table by clicking the names in the panel on the left side of the screen.\n                          \n                          Columns that have been applied appear in green in the panel on the left side of the screen;

The following screenshot shows you how both of these elements might appear in a typical Sumo\n                        \n                         Pivot View\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        When you first enter\n                        \n                         Pivot View\n                        \n                        while creating a Sumo table, no pivot table appears yet\u2014the right side of the screen is initially blank. As you add column names to the template table, data from those columns appears in the pivot table area in the appropriate location (for example, when you drag the name of a values column into the\n                        \n                         Drag Values Here\n                        \n                        region of the template table, all of the values from that column appear in the values region of the pivot table). Likewise, when you remove column names from the template table, the data for those columns is removed from the pivot table area. For more information about these and other components of this view, see\n                        \n                         Sumo Editor Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        After you have added a column name to any region of the template table, you can drag it to any other position you want. This updates the pivot table accordingly. You can also remove a column name from the template table by clicking the \"x\" to the right of the name. You can also remove columns from the pivot table by clicking the column and selecting\n                        \n                        in the pop-up menu.\n                       \n\n                        In most circumstances, you will move values columns into the\n                        \n                         Drag Values Here\n                        \n                        region of the template table and category columns into the\n                        \n                         Drag Categories Here\n                        \n                        regions. However, you are not obligated to do so. If you want, you can move values columns into the category regions and vice versa.\n                       \n\n                        If you double-click a column name, it is added automatically to the most appropriate region of the template table. For example, if your template table contained two column names in the \"Rows\" region but only one column name in the \"Columns\" region, any category column name you double-clicked would be added to the \"Columns\" region.\n                       \n\n                        You can drag multiple column names into any of the three positions in the template table, and the pivot table populates with the data from all of those columns.\n                       \n\n                        There is no limit to the number of columns you can apply to a Sumo Card. However, because each new column makes your table bigger and more difficult to read, you might want to set a limit of four or five columns in a table.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Example\n                         \n\n\n\n                        The following example shows how a user might build a typical pivot table showing profits gained from customers. The user wants to show customer names in the rows, so he drags the \"Cust\" column name from the\n                        \n                         Categories\n                        \n                        listing into the left-side\n                        \n                         Drag Categories Here\n                        \n                        region of the template table, as shown below:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The rows region of the pivot table then fills in with the names of all of the customers found in this column.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The user then drags the \"Amount\" column into the values region of the template table. The pivot table shows the profits gained from each customer:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The user now drops the \"Region\" column name into the\u00a0upper categories region\u00a0of the template table, which expands the pivot table as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        You are not limited, however, to having only one column name per region. By dropping a second column (that is, \"Type\") into the\u00a0upper categories\u00a0region of the template table, the user expands the pivot table even further to divide purchases by type:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Changing the aggregation type in a Sumo table\n                       \n\n                        After you have aggregated Sumo data in\n                        \n                         Column View\n                        \n                        or\n                        \n                         Pivot View\n                        \n                        , you can change the aggregation type.

Each column in this view includes a \"TOTAL\" cell at the bottom.

You can click the aggregation indicator in a total cell to pop up a list of alternate aggregation types. If you change the total aggregation type for a column that has itself been aggregated (by applying a \"Group\" or \"Date Grain\" to the table), the aggregation type for the column is also changed.

Also, the column you grouped turns blue, and an ascending sort is applied automatically. The five instances of \"GL Electronics\" are combined, and the amounts in the \"Amount\" columns for all of those instances are totaled to yield a single value of \"1,050,028.\" Cells in columns that cannot be aggregated display a value of \"Unique\" by default, which is a count of all unique items within that column. For example, if a column with salesperson names contained five instances of the name \"Bob Jones,\" that name would only be counted once in the \"Unique\" aggregation. You can change the aggregation type for any column except the column you grouped.

This combines the groupings for both \"Cust\" and \"Region,\" in effect \"unzipping\" all unique \"Cust\"-\"Region\" pairings.

For example, you could have a descending sort in your date column (so that the most recent date would appear at the top) and an ascending (alphabetical) sort in your series column.\n                       \n\n                        When you sort by a values column, other columns are sorted accordingly to match the order of the values. In the following example, the user has applied an ascending sort to the \"Amount\" column. The \"Region\" and \"Cust\" columns are both sorted individually to match the sorting of the values within them. For each \"Region\"-\"Cust\" pairing, an individual total is given, and subtotals are provided for both regions.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        This \"nesting\" of values allows viewers to quickly see the highest or lowest series in a table without having to scrutinize the values themselves. In the above screenshot, for example, the viewer can immediately see that the \"Americas\" region has had stronger sales than the \"APAC\" region. He can also see that within the \"Americas\" region, \"GL Electronics\" has been the highest-paying customer. The viewer can then look at the actual values on the right if he wants to see more specific details.\n                       \n\n\n                         To apply a sort to a column in Pivot View,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          In the pivot table, click the header of the column or row you want to sort.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Click\n                          \n                           Sort Ascending\n                          \n                          or\n                          \n                           Sort Descending\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Understanding the relationship between views\n                       \n\n                        Because you can switch between the two views in the edit view, it is helpful to understand how making changes in one view may affect what you see in the other.
