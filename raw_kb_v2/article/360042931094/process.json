This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Unleashed connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Unleashed account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n An Unleashed API ID\n* An Unleashed API key\n\nYou can find these credentials\u00a0on the API access page inside the Unleashed application.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Unleashed Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Unleashed Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Unleashed account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Unleashed report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Assemblies\n  |\n Returns a list of assemblies.\n  |\n|\n Attribute Sets\n  |\n Returns a list of all attribute sets.\n  |\n|\n Batch Numbers\n  |\n Returns a list of all batch numbers.\n  |\n|\n Bill Materials\n  |\n Returns a list of all bills of materials.\n  |\n|\n Companies\n  |\n Returns a list\u00a0of companies.\n  |\n|\n Credit Notes\n  |\n Returns a list of all credit notes.\n  |\n|\n Customer Delivery Addresses\n  |\n Returns a list\u00a0of all\u00a0customer delivery addresses.\n  |\n|\n Customers\n  |\n Returns a list of customers.\n  |\n|\n Customer Types\n  |\n Returns a list\u00a0of customer types.\n  |\n|\n Delivery Methods\n  |\n Returns a list of delivery methods.\n  |\n|\n Payment Terms\n  |\n Returns a list of payment terms.\n  |\n|\n Product Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of\u00a0product groups\n  |\n|\n Products\n  |\n Returns a list of products.\n  |\n|\n Purchase Orders\n  |\n Returns a list of purchase orders.\n  |\n|\n Sales Orders\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of sales orders.\n  |\n|\n Sales Order Groups\n  |\n Returns a list\u00a0of sales order groups.\n  |\n|\n Sales Persons\n  |\n Returns a list of salespeople.\n  |\n|\n Sales Shipments\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of sales shipments.\n  |\n|\n Serial Numbers\n  |\n Returns a list of all serial numbers.\n  |\n|\n Shipping Companies\n  |\n Returns a list all non-obsolete shipping companies.\n  |\n|\n Stock Adjustments\n  |\n Returns a list of stock adjustments.\n  |\n|\n Stock on Hand\n  |\n Returns a list of all stock on hand.\n  |\n|\n Suppliers\n  |\n Returns\u00a0a list of suppliers.\n  |\n|\n Supplier Return Reasons\n  |\n Returns a list of supplier return reasons.\n  |\n|\n Taxes\n  |\n Returns a list of taxes.\n  |\n|\n Unit Of Measures\n  |\n Returns a list of units of measurement.\n  |\n|\n Warehouses\n  |\n Returns a list of warehouses.\n  |\n|\n Warehouse Stock Transfers\n  |\n Returns a list of warehouse stock transfers.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Modified Since\n  |\n Select whether your \"modified since\" date (which you enter in the\n **Modified Since Date**\n field) is a specific or relative date (relative meaning it is a given number of days back rather than a specific date).\n  |\n|\n Modified Since Date\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0specific date to return data modified since this date.\n  |\n|\n Modified Since Days\n  |\n Enter a relative number of days back to return data modified during this timeframe.\n  |\n|\n Reason (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the reason you want to retrieve report data for (e.g.\n\ndefect\n\n).\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date.
