You can use Domo's\u00a0Twitter Ads\u00a0connector to retrieve data about statistics for accounts, campaigns, funding instruments, line items, and tweets. For more information about the Twitter API, see their documentation (\n\nhttps://developer.twitter.com/en/docs\n\n).\n\n\n The Twitter Ads connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Twitter Ads\u00a0connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector lets you discover impressions, who is interacting with your Twitter ads, and the kind of reach you're getting.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Total number of engagements\n* Total number of impressions\n* Total number of retweets\n* Total number of replies\n* Total number of likes\n* Total number of follows\n* Total number of clicks, including favorites and other engagements\n* Total number of qualified impressions\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n All marketing roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 10 minutes or less\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Create DataSets that use\n **Replace**\n instead of\n **Append**\n , and only pull the last 3-7 days at a time.\n* Use a recursive DataFlow to deduplicate and append data. For more information, see\n\nCreating a Recursive/Snapshot Magic ETL DataFlow\n\n.\n* To collect historical promoted Tweet Statistics and then update it with the latest tweet data, follow these steps:\n\n\n\t1. Create a new Twitter Ads DataSet.\n\n**Tip:**\n\n You may want to configure more settings than what is shown here; feel free to add settings according to your needs. Keep in mind that we will be selecting two different reports, the Promoted Tweet Statistics v.1 and Recent Promoted Tweets Statistics v.1. Make sure your settings match for both of these.\n\t2. Configure the connector for the first run, making sure to configure settings as follows:\n\t\t1. For the\n\t\t **Report**\n\t\t , select \"Promoted Tweets Statistics v.1.\"\n\t\t2. For the duration of the report, choose to pull data for the past 90 days (the connector limits you to 90 days of data; if you need more then that, we suggest selecting the first date of history you want and then selecting 90 days after that, running the report on Append, selecting the next 90 days, then running the DataSet again on Append, etc. until you have collected all the history you want).\n\n\n\t3. Save the configurations.\n\t4. Schedule the connector to \"Append\" instead of \"Replace.\"\n\t5. Run the connector.\n\t6. Once the run has completed, reconfigure the connector for the second run as follows:\n\n\t1. For the\n\t\t **Report**\n\t\t , select \"Recent Promoted Tweets Statistics v.2.\"\n\t\t2. For\n\t\t **Tweets Selection Window**\n\t\t , select\n\t\t **Past 3 Months**\n\t\t .\n\t\t3. For the duration of the report, choose to pull data for yesterday.\n\n\n\t\t**Note:**\n\n\t The other settings should match how you had them in the configuration of the first run; the only difference is you have no promoted tweets to select as this report will bring in tweet activity on all the promoted tweets that had activity yesterday.\n\n7. Save the configuration.\n\t8. Make sure the scheduling is set to \"Append.\"\n\t9. Let the connector run on the next schedule\u2014you want it to run tomorrow to collect the most recent tweet activity from the previous day.\n\n\n\t Congratulations, you have just selected the promoted tweet history and configured the DataSet to collect yesterday's promoted tweet activity, appending it to the history you just collected.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Twitter Ads\u00a0account and create a Twitter Ads\u00a0DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The Twitter account to use to log into your Twitter Ads account.\n* The password you use to log into your Twitter account.\n\nConnecting to your Twitter Ads account\n----------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Twitter Ads connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Twitter Ads\u00a0connector uses OAuth to connect to Twitter Ads. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Twitter Ads accounts in Domo)\u00a0to open the Twitter Ads\u00a0OAuth screen where you can enter the credentials associated with your Twitter account. After you have entered valid Twitter credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Twitter Ads\u00a0DataSet.\n\n\n You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nCreating and Managing User Groups\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane includes a primary menu,\n **Report**\n , and other menus that appear depending on the report you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Twitter Ads report.

This means that your business will need to sign a contract with Twitter to use this API. See\n\nTwitter Enterprise data\n\nfor more information and to set up a contract with Twitter to access this API.\n\n\n Once your company has access to the Twitter Engagement API, contact your Account Executive or Customer Success Manager. They will ensure that you have access to the connector in your Domo instance.\n\n###\n What endpoint is the base URL for this connector?\n\nThe base URL for the Twitter Ads connector is\n\nhttps://ads-api.twitter.com/\n\n.\n\n###\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Media\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/account\\_media\n  |\n|\n Account Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=ACCOUNT\n  |\n|\n All Campaigns\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/campaigns\n  |\n|\n All Funding Instruments\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/funding\\_instruments\n  |\n|\n All Line Items\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/line\\_items\n  |\n|\n All Promoted Tweets\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/promoted\\_tweets?with\\_deleted=true\n  |\n|\n Campaign Reach\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}/reach/campaigns\n  |\n|\n Campaign Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=CAMPAIGN\n  |\n|\n Funding Instruments Reach\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}/reach/funding\\_instruments\n  |\n|\n Funding Instruments Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=funding\\_instruments\n  |\n|\n Line Item Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=LINE\\_ITEM\n  |\n|\n Media Creatives\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/media\\_creatives\n  |\n|\n Media Creatives Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=MEDIA\\_CREATIVES\n  |\n|\n Media Library\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/media\\_library\n  |\n|\n Organic Tweet Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=ORGANIC\\_TWEET\n  |\n|\n Promoted Tweet Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=PROMOTED\\_TWEET\n  |\n|\n Reach Estimate (deprecated)\n  |\n /6/accounts/{account\\_id}/reach\\_estimate\n  |\n|\n Recent Organic Tweet Statistics\n  |\n /10/stats/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=ORGANIC\\_TWEET\n  |\n|\n Recent Promoted Tweet Statistics\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}?entity=PROMOTED\\_TWEET\n  |\n|\n Tweets\n  |\n /10/accounts/{account\\_id}/tweets\n  |\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the email address or Twitter handle, and password associated with your Twitter account.\n\n###\n How do I know my Twitter credentials are secure?\n\nThe login process uses the OAuth process, so your credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n Do I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?\n\nYou must have an Advertising account. You may register for an Advertising account at \"\n\nads.twitter.com\n\n\". You can have multiple Twitter user accounts associated with a single Advertising account.\n\n###\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nMost information is available immediately. It is recommended to configure the datasets to run every 24 hours.\n\n###\n Can I use the same Twitter account for multiple datasets?\n\nYes\n\n###\n Why didn't my dataset return any new rows when it ran?\n\nThis generally happens if there is no data for the connector to return. Most frequently this happens if there is no activity (new tweets, retweets, etc.) on the account after the Start Date.\n\n###\n Why is the report taking so long to run? Is this normal?\n\nSome of the reports can take a very long time to run. They have to read through several levels of data, making multiple calls to Twitter at each step. The time increases even more if you select all Tweets and run for all time.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nTroubleshooting usually starts with making sure you don't have an issue with the credentials. If those are clear, next check that your request isn't timing out. If you select all Tweets and run for all time, you can expect to experience long run times. Adjust the number of Tweets you are pulling or the time frame if you are experiencing these issues.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042927514\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003703\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nTwitter Ads Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,755\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "twitter_ads_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
