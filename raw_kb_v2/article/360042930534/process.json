Domo's Kafka Connector lets you pull information on messaging topics, topic data, and partitions so that you can cut through the noise and focus on the communication that is most vital. To learn more about the Kafka API, visit their page (\n                        \n                         https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/\n                        \n                        ).\n                        \n\n\n\n                        You connect to your Kafka account in the Data Center.
