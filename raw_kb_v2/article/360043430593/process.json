Once submitted, a request proceeds in a linear fashion through the approval chain. While the request is pending review, the submitter or the pending approver may edit any of the request details.\n                        \n                        While reviewing a request, the pending approver may choose to approve, deny, request a change, or delegate. When taking any of these actions, the approver may also leave an optional message to provide context for the action taken.\n                       \n\n                        This topic discusses how to submit requests for approval as well as approve them. For information about creating a request template, see\n                        \n                         Approvals\u00a0Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Example\n                       \n\n                        Let's say that the chief inspections engineer for filtration company \"Wetter Water\" creates a template to be used by members of his\u00a0quality control staff whenever they need to do an inspection at a customer company. The template includes required fields such as the customer name, the physical address, the expected amount of time to be spent offsite, the priority level, and so on. Two approvers are specified in the approval chain\u2014Marlo, the chief inspections engineer himself, and Marlo's supervisor, company COO Janice. The following workflow shows a typical example of how this template might be used:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Quality engineer Jake receives a call from a customer complaining about low water flow in a fountain.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Jake fills out the inspection template with details for a planned visit and submits it.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Marlo\u00a0is notified about the request via email.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Marlo opens Approvals and\u00a0takes a look at the details of the request. Satisfied, he gives his stamp of approval.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Janice is notified about the request via email.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Janice opens Approvals and takes a look at the details of the request. She feels that Jake has scheduled too much time for the inspection, as the customer company is located only a mile away and the problem probably has an easy solution. She uses the\n                          \n                           Request Change\n                          \n                          option, being sure to include\u00a0a message suggesting that Jake subtract an hour from the allotted time.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Jake is notified via email that the request has been sent back.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Jake opens Approvals and modifies the proposed amount of time. He then resubmits the request.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Marlo and Janice both approve the modified request.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Jake is notified via email that his request has been approved.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Submitting a Request\n                       \n\n                        As explained above, when you submit a request, the first Domo user specified in the approver chain receives a notification.
