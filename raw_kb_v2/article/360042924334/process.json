An example would be a bulb that turns green or red, depending on the air quality.\n\n\n The following table lists the types of gauges available in Domo:\n\n\n Gauge Type\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Single Value\u00a0gauge\n\n|\n A Single Value gauge displays the first value in your DataSet as a numeral. No other graphics or images are used. This chart type is useful when you want to see a single value quickly without having to interpret bars, lines, etc.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nSingle Value Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Filled gauge\n\n|\n Filled gauges are circular gauges that \"fill\" to indicate the current value of the gauge, like a thermometer.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nFilled Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Progress Bar gauge\n\n|\n A Progress Bar gauge is similar to a Filled gauge but is bar-shaped rather than circular and shows its value as a percentage.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nProgress Bar Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Radial gauge\n\n|\n Radial gauges use an indicator that pivots around the gauge scale to indicate the current data value associated with the gauge. Common Radial gauges include dials and speedometers.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nRadial Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Face gauge\n\n|\n In a Face gauge, any of three different versions of a face (smiling, happy, or neither) is shown, depending on where the current value falls. This can be used to instantly classify a value as poor, fair, or good.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nFace Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Comparative gauge\n\n|\n A Comparative gauge is a simple gauge consisting of a single value that shows the degree of change between a previous value and a current value. The degree of change may be shown as a percentage or as the actual difference between values. Alternatively, you may choose to show only the current value.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nComparative Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Comparative Fill gauge (Basic)\n\n|\n A basic Comparative Fill Gauge is similar to a Filled Gauge but includes a\u00a0parameter for a previous value.\u00a0The gauge\u00a0fills in only between this previous value and the current value so viewers can see the degree of change since the gauge was last updated. In addition,\u00a0the percentage and direction of change\u00a0appears in the center of the chart. This gauge type also includes a parameter for a target value, but this is optional.\n\n\n This\u00a0gauge type is the same as an advanced Comparative Fill Gauge but is simpler, requiring only four columns (with an optional fifth), whereas the\u00a0advanced\u00a0version requires eight.\n\n\n For more information about\u00a0Comparative Fill Gauges, see\n\nComparative Fill Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Comparative Fill gauge (Advanced)\n\n|\n An advanced Comparative Fill Gauge has the same features as\u00a0the basic version but also allows you to\u00a0create a lower and upper range and\u00a0specify a median value.\u00a0These elements are displayed\u00a0on a second circle in the gauge for a cleaner look.\n\n\n For more information about Comparative Fill Gauges, see\n\nComparative Fill Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Radial Progress gauge\n\n|\n Filled gauges are circular gauges that \"fill\" to indicate the current value of the gauge, like a thermometer. For more information, see\n\nRadial Progress Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Shape gauge\n\n|\n\nA shape gauge uses any of 45 different images to indicate a current value. By using different images to indicate different ranges, you can convey to users whether the current value is positive, neutral, or negative. For more information, see\n\nShape Gauge.\n\n\n |\n\n|\n|\n Multi Radial Progress gauge\n\n|\n Filled gauges are circular gauges that \"fill\" to indicate the current value of the gauge, like a thermometer. The Multi Radial Gauge allows for displaying for more than one metric. For more information, see\n\nMulti Radial Progress Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Multi-Value gauge\n\n|\n\nA multi-value gauge displays the current value of your as DataSet\u00a0as a numeral, along with the\u00a0degree of change for the gauge data, whether positive or negative.\n\n\n This chart type is useful when you want to see a change in value quickly, without having to interpret bars, lines, etc. For more information, see\n\nMulti-Value Gauge.\n\n\n |\n\n|\n|\n Waffle gauge\n\n|\n Waffle charts provide a new, simple and intuitive way to visualize data as it includes many customizable settings to tell a more informative story. For more information, see\n\nWaffle Gauge\n\n.\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042924334\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004734\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAvailable Gauges\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,060\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:27 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "available_gauges", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
