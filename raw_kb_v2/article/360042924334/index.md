Gauges classify data values as belonging to a predetermined range. An example would be a bulb that turns green or red, depending on the air quality.


 The following table lists the types of gauges available in Domo:


 Gauge Type
  |
 Description
  |
 Example
  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|
 Single Value gauge

|
 A Single Value gauge displays the first value in your DataSet as a numeral. No other graphics or images are used. This chart type is useful when you want to see a single value quickly without having to interpret bars, lines, etc.


 For more information, see

Single Value Gauge

|
 Filled gauge

|
 Filled gauges are circular gauges that "fill" to indicate the current value of the gauge, like a thermometer.


 For more information, see

Filled Gauge

|
|
 Progress Bar gauge

|
 A Progress Bar gauge is similar to a Filled gauge but is bar-shaped rather than circular and shows its value as a percentage.


 For more information, see

Progress Bar Gauge

|
|
 Radial gauge

|
 Radial gauges use an indicator that pivots around the gauge scale to indicate the current data value associated with the gauge. Common Radial gauges include dials and speedometers.

|
|
 Face gauge

|
 In a Face gauge, any of three different versions of a face (smiling, happy, or neither) is shown, depending on where the current value falls. This can be used to instantly classify a value as poor, fair, or good.

|
 Comparative gauge

|
 A Comparative gauge is a simple gauge consisting of a single value that shows the degree of change between a previous value and a current value. The degree of change may be shown as a percentage or as the actual difference between values. Alternatively, you may choose to show only the current value.

 Comparative Fill gauge (Basic)

|
 A basic Comparative Fill Gauge is similar to a Filled Gauge but includes a parameter for a previous value. The gauge fills in only between this previous value and the current value so viewers can see the degree of change since the gauge was last updated. In addition, the percentage and direction of change appears in the center of the chart. This gauge type also includes a parameter for a target value, but this is optional.


 This gauge type is the same as an advanced Comparative Fill Gauge but is simpler, requiring only four columns (with an optional fifth), whereas the advanced version requires eight.

|
 Comparative Fill gauge (Advanced)

|
 An advanced Comparative Fill Gauge has the same features as the basic version but also allows you to create a lower and upper range and specify a median value. These elements are displayed on a second circle in the gauge for a cleaner look.

 Radial Progress gauge

|
 Filled gauges are circular gauges that "fill" to indicate the current value of the gauge, like a thermometer. For more information, see

Radial Progress Gauge

|
|
 Shape gauge

|

A shape gauge uses any of 45 different images to indicate a current value. By using different images to indicate different ranges, you can convey to users whether the current value is positive, neutral, or negative. For more information, see

Shape Gauge.

 Multi Radial Progress gauge

|
 Filled gauges are circular gauges that "fill" to indicate the current value of the gauge, like a thermometer. The Multi Radial Gauge allows for displaying for more than one metric. For more information, see

Multi Radial Progress Gauge

.

|
|
 Multi-Value gauge

|

A multi-value gauge displays the current value of your as DataSet as a numeral, along with the degree of change for the gauge data, whether positive or negative.


 This chart type is useful when you want to see a change in value quickly, without having to interpret bars, lines, etc. For more information, see

Multi-Value Gauge.
