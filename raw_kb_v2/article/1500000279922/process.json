Zoom provides a remote conferencing service that combines video conferencing, online meetings, chat, and mobile collaboration. Zoom Phone calling features have been designed to give you a flexible, mobile, and powerful cloud phone system.\u00a0Use Domo's Zoom Phone connector to retrieve your Zoom phone data. To learn more about the Zoom API, visit their\n\nAPI Documentation\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Zoom account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Zoom Phone connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Zoom account in order to retrieve your Zoom phone details, you must first select your account type.\u00a0Select the Account Type as Business and higher if your plan is Business, Education, VIP, API Partner or Enterprise otherwise select Pro.\n\n\n Once you select your account type, you need to sign into your Zoom account using your\u00a0Zoom email address and password. Alternatively, you can connect to Zoom via Google, Facebook, or an SSO login.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Zoom Account\n---------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the Zoom Phone Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet,****\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nIn this pane, you need to select your Zoom account type. Select the Account Type as Business and higher if your plan is Business, Education, VIP, API Partner, or Enterprise otherwise select Pro. For more information, see the\n\nPrerequisites\n\nsection.\n\n\n The Domo Zoom Phone connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n ****Connect****\n (or select\n ****Add Account****\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Zoom accounts in Domo) to open the Zoom OAuth screen where you can enter your Zoom email and password. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Zoom Phone DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Zoom when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of your Zoom account.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n ****Reports****\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Zoom Phone report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Call Logs\n  |\n Retrieve a list of active or inactive host report for a specified period of time.\n  |\n|\n Calling Plans\n  |\n List all Zoom phone calling plans that are enabled for a Zoom account.\n  |\n|\n Phone Number Details\n  |\n Retrieve details of a specific phone number in a Zoom account.\n  |\n|\n Phone Numbers\n  |\n List all Zoom phone numbers in a Zoom account.\n  |\n|\n Phone Users\n  |\n List all the users on an account who have been assigned Zoom phone licenses.\n  |\n|\n User Call Logs\n  |\n Retrieve a Zoom phone user's call logs.\n  |\n|\n User Profile\n  |\n Retrieve a user's Zoom phone profile.\n  |\n|\n User Recordings\n  |\n Retrieve a user's Zoom phone recordings.\n  |\n|\n User Voicemails\n  |\n Retrieve a user's Zoom Phone voicemails.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Call Log Type\n  |\n Choose the call log type.\n  |\n|\n Phone Number\n  |\n Select a phone number.\n  |\n|\n Phone Number Type\n  |\n Choose the phone number type.\n  |\n|\n Extension Type\n  |\n Choose the extension type.\n  |\n|\n Number Type\n  |\n Choose the number type.\n  |\n|\n Pending Numbers\n  |\n Choose whether to include or exclude pending numbers.\n  |\n|\n Site\n  |\n Select a site.\n  |\n|\n User\n  |\n Select a user.\n  |\n|\n Status\n  |\n Choose the status.\n  |\n|\n Date Selection\n  |\n Select the date format for your data.\n  |\n|\n Single Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Specific Date\n  |\n Select the specific date using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Relative Date\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for in the\n ****Days Back****\n field.
