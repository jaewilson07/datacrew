Orchestration capabilities offer robust solutions for integrating internal and external systems, configuring decision logic, and automating activities in a workflow. In addition, you have greater visibility into your workflows and how they can be optimized through tracking and metric features.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        You can monitor and review any workflow that has been deployed in your instance.
