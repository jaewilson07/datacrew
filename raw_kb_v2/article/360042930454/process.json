To learn more about the Kintone API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.kintone.io/hc/en-u...ntone-REST-API\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Kintone account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Kintone connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Kintone account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Kintone subdomain. This is the portion of your Kintone\u00a0instance URL immediately following\n\nhttps://\n\n. For example, if your instance was\n\n\n https://mycompany.kintone.com\n\n\n , your subdomain would be\n\nmycompany\n\n.\n* The username and password for your Kintone account.\n\nConnecting to Your Kintone Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Kintone Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling,**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Kintone account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Subdomain Name\n  |\n Enter your Kintone subdomain name. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username for your Kintone account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password for your Kintone account.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Kintone credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Kintone DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains two primary menus,\n **Guest Space ID**\n and\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Guest Space ID\n  |\n If your application exists inside a Guest Space, enter your Guest Space ID here.\n  |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Kintone report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Apps\n  |\n Returns information for all apps, with their names, descriptions, related space, creator, and update information.\n  |\n|\n All Records of 1 App\n  |\n Retrieves multiple records for a given app.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n App ID\n  |\n Enter the App ID of the Kintone app you want to retrieve data for. To find the ID for an app, open the app and view the URL. The App ID is the number after\n\n/k\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Record Number (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the record number of the app you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n FAQ\n\n\n####\n What version of the Kintone API does this connector use?\n\nThis connector uses version 1 of the Kintone API (\n\nhttps://{\n\nsub-domain-name}.\n\ncybozu.com/k/v1/\n\nFor guest space:\n\nhttps://(sub\n\ndomain name).\n\ncybozu.com/k/guest/\n\n{spaceID}/v1/).\n\n###\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report Name\n  | **Endpoint URL**  |\n|\n All Apps\n  |\n /apps.json\n  |\n|\n All Records of 1 App\n  |\n /app.json\n  |\n\n\n####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the Kintone domain name (e.g.\n\nsample.kintone.com\n\n), and the username and password associated with the domain.\n\n###\n Can I use the same account multiple times to create datasets?\n\nYes.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDatasets should be set to update no more than once every 15 minutes.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nKintone may limit API calls. To prevent rate limiting, reduce the number of datasets scheduled to run at the same time.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930454\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003418\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nKintone Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,813\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "kintone_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
