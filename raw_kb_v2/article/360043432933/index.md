 As of November 15, 2018, the Quandl Stock Reports connector has been deprecated. However, you can still import data for any of the three Quandl report types (Quandl End of Day, Quandl Zacks Fundamentals, and Quandl NASDAQ 100) using our Quandl public DataSet connectors. You can import public DataSets into Domo with just a few clicks—all you need to do is set your scheduling and give your DataSet a name. For more information about these and other public DataSets, see

Public DataSet Connectors
