Intro
-------

Centro (formerly called SiteScout) is the first and largest self-serve advertising platform for buying online banner ad space (in real time) across the web and on mobile devices. They help advertisers and agencies streamline the digital media buying process.

For more information about the Centro API, visit their website (


 https://www.centro.net/products/dsp-...ic-advertising


 ).

The Centro connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

You connect to your Centro account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Centro connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
----------------

To connect to your Centro account, you must have the following:

 A Centro client ID, and
* A Centro client secret.

For information about obtaining these credentials, please visit

http://www.Centro.com/blog/2013/0...Centro-api/

.


**Note:**

The authentication and authorization processes are performed in accordance with the OAuth 2 specification. At this time Centro only supports the Client Credentials grant type. This grant type is ideal for API clients that require access to their own resources (as opposed to the client acting as a third party and requesting access on behalf of another user). One of the key advantages of this grant type is a simplified authentication flow that allows the client to proceed directly to token generation with the authorization grant being assumed. It must be noted that the Client Credentials grant type must exclusively be implemented with applications that guarantee the security of their client credentials.


 Connecting to Your Centro Account
------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Centro Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,

 and

 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in
