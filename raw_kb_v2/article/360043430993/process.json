They help advertisers and agencies streamline the digital media buying process.\n                        \n                         For more information about the Centro\u00a0API, visit\u00a0their website\u00a0(\n                        \n\n                         https://www.centro.net/products/dsp-...ic-advertising\n                        \n\n                         ).\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        The Centro connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n                        \n                         Cloud App\n                        \n                        in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                         You connect to your\u00a0Centro account in the Data Center.

At this time Centro only supports the Client Credentials grant type.\u00a0This grant\u00a0type is ideal for API clients that require access to their own resources (as opposed to the client acting as a third\u00a0party and requesting access on behalf of another user). One of the key advantages of this grant type is a simplified authentication flow that allows the client to proceed directly to token generation with the authorization grant being assumed. It must be noted that the Client Credentials grant type must exclusively be implemented with applications that guarantee the security of their client credentials.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Connecting to Your\u00a0Centro Account\n                        \n\n\n\n                         This section enumerates the options in the\n                         \n                          Credentials\n                         \n                         and\n                         \n                          Details\n                         \n                         panes in the\u00a0Centro\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n                         \n                          Scheduling\n                         \n                         and\n                         \n                          Name & Describe Your DataSet\n                         \n                         , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n                         \n                          Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n\n\n                         Credentials Pane\n                        \n\n\n\n                         This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Centro\u00a0account.
