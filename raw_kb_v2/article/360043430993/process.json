They help advertisers and agencies streamline the digital media buying process.\n\nFor more information about the Centro\u00a0API, visit\u00a0their website\u00a0(\n\n\n https://www.centro.net/products/dsp-...ic-advertising\n\n\n ).\n\nThe Centro connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your\u00a0Centro account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Centro\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\nTo connect to your Centro account, you must have the following:\n\n A Centro\u00a0client ID, and\n* A Centro\u00a0client secret.\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, please visit\n\nhttp://www.Centro.com/blog/2013/0...Centro-api/\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe authentication and authorization processes are performed in accordance with the OAuth 2 specification. At this time Centro only supports the Client Credentials grant type.\u00a0This grant\u00a0type is ideal for API clients that require access to their own resources (as opposed to the client acting as a third\u00a0party and requesting access on behalf of another user). One of the key advantages of this grant type is a simplified authentication flow that allows the client to proceed directly to token generation with the authorization grant being assumed. It must be noted that the Client Credentials grant type must exclusively be implemented with applications that guarantee the security of their client credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Centro Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Centro\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Centro\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\n*Field**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nCentro Client ID\n\n|\n Enter your Centro Client ID.\n  |\n|\n Centro Client Secret\n  |\n\nEnter your Centro Client Secret.\n\n|\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0Centro\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Centro\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu in which you select a report type.\n\n\n|\n\nMenu\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nReport\n\n|\n\nSelect a Centro report.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Advertiser's Folder Structure\n  |\n Returns the top-level folders.\n  |\n|\n All Ad Exchanges\n  |\n Returns a list of ad exchanges.\n  |\n|\n All Brand Stats\n  |\n Returns statistics for all brands such as clicks, conversions,\u00a0and impressions won.\n  |\n|\n All Group Stats\n  |\n Returns statistics for a specific brand for all groups.\n  |\n|\n Audience Rules\n  |\n Returns audience targeting rules for the selected campaigns.\n  |\n|\n Audience Stats\n  |\n Returns statistics\u00a0for the specific audience such as total visitors and new visitors.\n  |\n|\n Campaign\n  |\n Returns data about campaigns for a given time frame, such as campaign name, budget amount, number of clicks, etc.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Folder's Statistics\n  |\n Returns statistics for the groups and campaign in the selected folder.\n  |\n|\n Campaign, per Site\n  |\n Returns site data for campaigns for a given time frame, such as site name, URL, number of clicks, revenue amount, etc.\n  |\n|\n Campaign, per Creative\n  |\n Returns creative data for campaigns for a given time frame, such as creative name, number of clicks, revenue amount, etc.\n  |\n|\n Campaign, per Offer\n  |\n Returns offer data for campaigns for a given time frame, such as number of clicks, number of conversions, revenue, etc.\n  |\n|\n Contextual Details\n  |\n Returns contextual targeting data.\n  |\n|\n Demographic Details\n  |\n Returns demographic targeting data.\n  |\n|\n Device Details\n  |\n Returns the current device targeting settings for the campaign.\n  |\n|\n Device Report\n  |\n Returns data for a given device.\n  |\n|\n Geographic Coordinates\n  |\n Returns latitude/longitude rules.\n  |\n|\n Geographic Rules\n  |\n Returns geographic targeting rules.\n  |\n|\n Group Campaign Stats\n  |\n Returns statistics for campaigns in the group.\n  |\n|\n Page Position\n  |\n Returns page position targeting data.\n  |\n|\n Reports\n  |\n Returns custom reports.\n  |\n|\n Traffic Type\n  |\n Returns traffic type targeting data.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Custom Report\n  |\n Select the Centro CSV report you want to import into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Report Type\n  |\n Select the desired report type for your \"Device Report.\"\n  |\n|\n Advertiser ID\n  |\n Enter the advertiser ID you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Campaign\n  |\n Select the campaign you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Selection\n  |\n Specify whether you want to pull data for all campaigns or a specific campaign.\n  |\n|\n Audience\n  |\n Select all audiences you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Folders\n  |\n Select the campaign folder you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Brand\n  |\n Select the brand you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Group\n  |\n Select the campaign group you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Site Reference\n  |\n Enter the URL for the website you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Creative ID\n  |\n Enter the ID of the creative you want to return data for.\n  |\n|\n Campaign Status\n  |\n Select a campaign status to filter your report data by.\n  |\n|\n Filter (Optional)\n  |\n Enter a keyword to filter campaign names by in your \"All Campaigns\" report.\n  |\n|\n Granularity\n  |\n Select the date grain for your data.
