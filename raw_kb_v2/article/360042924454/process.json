Includes geospatial vector data (import Google Earth and export as KML).\n                        \n\n\n                        Once you have added a\u00a0chart, it becomes available for users to select in the \"Custom Charts\" menu in the\n                        \n                         Chart Picker in Analyzer\n                        \n                        . This allows your users\u00a0to build visualizations pertinent to your business that are not available by default in Domo. Depending on the complexity of your charts, you may be able to upload charts without having to edit the SVG, or you may have to make extensive changes, which will most likely require a working knowledge of XML.\n                       \n\n                        You can also use the Custom Regions tool to upload a DataSet\u00a0that includes a column for the new custom regions matched with the sub-regions within them. This is not as robust as building your own SVG files but does not require a knowledge of XML. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Creating a Map with Regions\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           You must have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" enabled to add custom charts to your Domo instance. For more information about default security roles, see\n                           \n                            Managing Custom Roles\n                           \n                           .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        As a simple example, let's say user JJ, an executive\u00a0at\u00a0a doll factory in Hong Kong, wants to build a card showing sales of a new line of dolls throughout all the districts of Hong Kong. With the set of preinstalled maps available in Domo, she would have no way to do this. However, with Domo's custom charts feature, all JJ has to do is go online, download an SVG map of Hong Kong, then add it to her Domo in the Admin Settings or in Analyzer. The map is now available for JJ to use as well as anyone else with card-building\u00a0permissions. JJ creates her card in the same way she would create any other map card\u2014by uploading the DataSet\u00a0with her sales data, opening the Analyzer, selecting the \"Hong Kong\" map type, and plugging in the columns from the DataSet. The resulting map looks as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        As a slightly more complex example, let's say user Rodrigo manages a number of time share properties in the United States. These properties are divided across five distinct regions\u2014West, Southwest, Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. Rodrigo wants to be able to see at a glance the revenue gained from each region. Again, Domo does not include a preinstalled map for regions of the United States (and if it did, the states in each grouping would probably not exactly correspond to the states in the regions in Rodrigo's company). In this case, because custom grouping of regions is required, Rodrigo will need to customize an SVG\u00a0map of the United States to incorporate grouping. Luckily he has a basic knowledge of XML, so without too much trouble he is able to add the required grouping tags in order to divide up the map as needed:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                        These are two relatively simplistic examples of how Domo users might implement custom charts. More complex examples might include non-geographical maps such as college campuses...\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        ...layout charts for airplane seats...\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        ...and even assembly instructions, like the ones for this car bumper:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        With custom charts, you are limited only by your imagination, expertise, and amount of free time. Be aware that charts like those shown in the previous three examples are extremely complex and will require an extensive knowledge of XML to build. Also be aware that some XML tags are not supported at this time. These will be listed later in this article.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Important:\n                             \n\n\n\n                            The maximum size of an SVG, KML, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, and Shape file\n                           \n\n                            that can be imported and converted is 25 MB\n                            \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - Custom Maps and Charts\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Summary of steps\n                       \n\n                        In general, the process for adding custom charts to your Domo\u00a0and building cards from them will go as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Obtain the chart you want to add.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Edit the XML if necessary.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Add the chart to Domo in Admin Settings or Analyzer.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Build your chart card in Analyzer.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Obtaining an SVG chart\n                       \n\n                        In most cases, you can obtain an SVG chart for use in Domo\u00a0by either a) downloading it from the Internet, or b) building it yourself.\n                       \n\n                        If you want to install a map for a country not available in Domo, you can download it from any of a number of websites, such as\n                        \n                         http://www.amcharts.com/svg-maps/\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-maps\n                        \n                        . These sites also include maps for overseas territories such as French Guiana, Aruba, and so on. Once you have downloaded one of these maps, you can immediately upload it to Domo\u2014there is no need to manipulate the XML (unless you are planning to divide it into subregions).\n                       \n\n                        If you want to build an SVG chart yourself, you can do so using any of a number of vector-based drawing applications such as\n                        \n                         Adobe Illustrator\n                        \n                        or\n                        \n                         Inkscape\n                        \n                        . For information about these or other applications, please refer to their documentation.\n                       \n\n                        Editing the XML for your chart\n                       \n\n                        If your SVG\u00a0is not a simple regional map or requires any customization, you will need to edit the XML to incorporate the necessary changes. Based on the desired customizations and the complexity of the chart, these edits may be miniscule or extremely extensive. It is possible that you may attempt to upload an SVG\u00a0chart\u00a0to Domo and encounter an error; this is usually the result of unsupported tags in your XML. In this case you will need to either strip out the problematic tags or replace them with supported tags.\n                       \n\n                        This section provides lists of tags supported by Domo's SVG converter along with those that are not currently supported.\n                       \n\n                        Supported XML tags\n                       \n\n                        Supported shape tags\n                       \n\n                        The following shape tags are supported:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           path\n                          \n                          (all path commands are supported except rotating an arc)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           rect\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           circle\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           ellipse\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           line\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           polyline\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           polygon\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Of these, you can include data for all except\n                        \n                         line\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         polyline\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Supported style tags\n                       \n\n                        The following style tags are supported, either with a tag, in the\n                        \n                         style\n                        \n                        attribute, or from CSS embedded in the SVG.

In the above example, each region path includes an\n                        \n                         id\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         name\n                        \n                        subtag. These\u00a0tags are important because they also correspond to the region columns in your DataSet. When you build a map in Analyzer, you do so by dragging a region column into the \"State Name\" field above your map preview. (For more information about applying columns, see\n                        \n                         Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n                        \n                        .) So in this example, your DataSet would need to include at least one of the columns referenced above\u2014either a column with region IDs or names\u2014to match up with your SVG map.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           If an attribute of\n                           \n                            data-name\n                           \n                           is found, this will be the name used to target data. If this attribute does not exist, the next in priority is\n                           \n                            name\n                           \n                           . If neither of this is specified,\n                           \n                            id\n                           \n                           will be used.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        You could also add other subtags\u00a0as necessary to account for other possible names that may be used in a DataSet. For example, DataSets for most country maps include a column for ISO 3166 regional codes. So in the \"Colombia\" example above, the XML\u00a0could\u00a0include a third\u00a0subtag\u00a0with the code for each region. We can simply call this tag\n                        \n                         code\n                        \n                        .\u00a0So under the\n                        \n                         name=\"Amazonas\"\n                        \n                        tag\u00a0you could add something like\n                        \n                         code=\"01\"\n                        \n                        (because the ISO 3166 code for Amazonas is \"01\"), and then follow up in similar fashion with the other regions.\n                       \n\n                        The following example shows a simple DataSet\u00a0with columns that correspond to the previous code example (with an \"ISO 3166\" column added as suggested in the preceding paragraph):\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        If you want to combine\u00a0regions in a map into larger regions, you can do so by grouping all\n                        \n                         <path>\n                        \n                        tags in your SVG file into their appropriate groups then enclosing each group\u00a0within\n                        \n                         <g>\n                        \n                        and\n                        \n                         </g>\n                        \n                        tags.

For a list of these properties, see\n                        \n                         Properties for Maps\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Adding drill path to custom charts\n                       \n\n                        You can add drill path to custom charts so you can drill from one custom chart to another. You do this\n                        \n                         the same way as you would for any other chart\n                        \n                        . Note that for this to work, you must give the custom chart you are drilling to the\n                        \n                         same name\n                        \n                        as that of the group on the top chart you are drilling on. For example, if you had a custom regional map of America, and you wanted to drill to another custom chart on the \"Western Region,\" then the next custom map would\u00a0need to be called \"Western Region.\"", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042924454", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
