If you enable Custom Reports via Workday's web services, they become Reports-as-a-Service (RaaS) and can be imported into Domo. Once your reports are set up in Workday, this connector lets you select the available reports and bring them into Domo. For more information about the Workday API, see\n\nhttps://community.workday.com/node/134011\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Workday RaaS account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Workday connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to pull DataSets related to...\n * HR\n* Workforce planning\n* Recruiting\n* Talent management\n* Payroll\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * CIO\n* CEO\n* HR roles\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n An hour or less\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nIt is highly recommended that you do not pull reports containing calculated fields from Workday, as these cause extremely long import times, even for small reports.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Workday RaaS account and create a DataSet, you must have a Workday username and password.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Workday RaaS Account\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Workday RaaS Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Workday RaaS account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Workday username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Workday password.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Workday RaaS credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Workday RaaS DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains only two fields\u2014one in which you enter the URL for your report, and another in which you can optionally enter fields to exclude.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Enter the URL to Your Report\n  |\n Enter the URL for your Workday or Simple XML Report. You must provide the URL along with the fully qualified path, including the report name.\n\n\n For example:\n\nhttps://com.workday.report/service/Report\\_Name?format=simplexml\n\n\n For information about finding URLs in Workday, see\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n.\n\n|\n|\n Enter Fields to Exclude\n  |\n Enter a comma-separated list of fields (columns) to exclude from your XML import, if any.\n  |\n|\n Enter Your Sublisttoflatten\n  |\n Enter the comma separated lists that you want to flatten out in your data.\n  |\n|\n Flatten data\n  |\n Select this checkbox to bring data for all duplicate elements.\n  |\n|\n Merge Keys\n  |\n Enter the comma separated lists of keys that will be used to merge your data. This field is required if you are using the\n **Merge Update**\n mode.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nThis connector supports\n *only*\n Workday reports in Workday XML or Simple XML format. It does not support reports in CSV, RSS, GData, or JSON.\n\n\n To find report URLs in Workday, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to the\n **View Custom Report**\n screen for the report you want.\n2.
