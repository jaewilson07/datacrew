This makes it easy to explore, wrangle, and combine your data in a simple interface.

You can now do the following, all without leaving Analyzer:\n                       \n\n\n                         Join another DataSet.\n                        \n\n                         Clean up the data by renaming columns, removing columns, and changing the data type.\n                        \n\n                         Create nested Beast Modes.\n                        \n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Analyzer and DataSet Views Integration\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Advanced Tools Launch Center\n                       \n\n                        With the Advanced Tools Launch Center, you are now able to explore all the data tools Domo has to offer in one convenient place. Each tool has a link to more information and where to get started in the product.

Partitions uniquely identify sections of data, and each section can be replaced with a new version. This is a faster and cleaner way to update the data.

These new updates give you confidence and peace of mind that schema changes will only happen when you want them to.

When the local time on your machine changes for Daylight Savings, the Workbench job schedule will automatically sync with the time on your machine. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Workbench 5.1\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Database specific plugins in Workbench\n                       \n\n                        In Workbench 5.1, Workbench will read data types directly from the source system for specific databases. This eliminates any inconsistency between the two, and any chance the data type will change in Workbench after the schema has been set unless the type changes in the source system.

For more information, see\n                        \n                         Applying Page-Level Filters with Filter Views\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Aggregations in Filters\n                       \n\n                        With the addition of Aggregated Filters, you are now able to filter on an aggregated column value. Aggregated Filters are available to be used everywhere Filters are applied: inside the Analyzer, as a Quick Filter, on the Card Details page, and on a Dashboard. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Aggregated Filters\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Dynamic Date Dashboard Filters\n                       \n\n                        Dynamic Date Range Filters allow you to adjust the date range window for all the Cards on a Page. Dynamic Date Range Filters can be a huge time-saver, since users do not need to manually apply Filters to see data for a given date or time range. Also, with Dynamic Date Range Filters, the date range data for your Cards automatically \"rolls over\" when the current period ends. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Applying Page-Level Filters with Filter Views\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Page Filter settings\n                       \n\n                        With Page Filter settings, you can now customize how your users interact with Cards on your Dashboard. You can toggle off\n                        \n                         Allow adding of new filters\n                        \n                        to have users only use Card interactions to filter. You can also turn off Date Filters if your Dashboard is built to look at a specific time frame.\u00a0For more information, see\n                        \n                         Applying Page Level-Filters and Filter Views\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Segments\n                       \n\n                        The Segments feature allows you to create better comparisons of a Segment versus another group. It also allows you to dynamically filter one item and not have the filter impact the Segment so that you can compare the two results. You can add a Segment to any multi-series chart, period over period chart, or multi-value chart. You can also add Segments to the Card Details view of a Card and to Dashboards.

Instead of just having an item and a value, you can have nested Tree Maps in a Tree Map. For example, now you can see not only products and their associated sales in a Tree Map but visualize product sales by category and by division in a three-level nested Tree Map. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Tree Map\n                        \n                        .\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Color Rules on Line Charts\n                       \n\n                        You can now create Line charts that apply Color Rules to each point on the line individually. You can set it to change the color when it is above, below, or between certain thresholds. This makes it a breeze to see the data and understand the performance at a glance.

Selecting the right side orientation adjusts the labels, bars, and annotations to be aligned on the right side of the chart. This gives you a powerful combination when you want to layout your custom story with some charts aligned to the right side and can easily be coupled with left side oriented charts for new visual insights.
