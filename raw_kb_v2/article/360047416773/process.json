Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nBacking up DataSet jobs is\u00a0an often overlooked task when using Workbench. You may be wondering why jobs need to be backed up if they\u2019re stored in the Domo cloud. Accidents can happen. Jobs can be accidentally deleted by Workbench users, which will also permanently delete them from the cloud. Further, if the account is accidentally removed from Workbench, all jobs are deleted from the cloud. Exporting your jobs ensures you have a fallback option in the event of a problem.\n\n\n Your exported job files should be stored somewhere safe, as they can contain secure information including API keys, queries, database and/or filenames, etc. Treat them the same as you would passwords or financial information.\n\n*Training Video - Backing Up Jobs**\n\n*To back up jobs in Workbench 4,**\n\n. Open Workbench 4.\n2. Starting at the bottom and working your way to the top, do the following for each job:\n\n1. Right-click the job\u00a0name and select\n\t **Export**\n\t**DataSet job**\n\t .\n\t2. Give the exported job file a name.\n\t3. Choose a location to save it in.\n\nYou should make a new backup for a job each time a change is made to that job.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360047416773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004785\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBacking Up Workbench 4 Jobs\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,847\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "backing_up_workbench_4_jobs", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
