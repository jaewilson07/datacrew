Mongoose Metrics exposes what happens before, during and after telephone conversations to assist clients with actionable data for quick and effective marketing spending. To learn more about the Mongoose Metrics API, visit their page (

).


 You connect to your Mongoose Metrics account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Mongoose Metrics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Mongoose Metrics account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Mongoose Metrics username
* A Mongoose Metrics API key

*Note:**
 The API key you generate from Mongoose Metrics is for version 2 of the API. If you want to generate an API key that is compatible with version 1 of the API, you will need to reach out to your Mongoose Metrics support agent.
