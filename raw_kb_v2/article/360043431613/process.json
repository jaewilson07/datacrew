To learn more about the Mongoose Metrics API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://calltrackingportal.com/innovations-api.php\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Mongoose Metrics account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Mongoose Metrics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Mongoose Metrics account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Mongoose Metrics username\n* A Mongoose Metrics API key\n\n*Note:**\n The API key you generate from Mongoose Metrics is for version 2 of the API. If you want to generate an API key that is compatible with version 1 of the API, you will need to reach out to your Mongoose Metrics support agent.\n\n\n For information about enabling API access and obtaining a key, see\n\nhttps://support.mongooseportal.com/h...ing-API-Access\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Mongoose Metrics Account\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Mongoose Metrics Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Mongoose Metrics account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Mongoose Metrics username.\n  |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter your Mongoose Metrics API key.\u00a0For information about enabling API access and obtaining a key, see\n\nhttps://support.mongooseportal.com/h...ing-API-Access\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Mongoose Metrics credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Mongoose Metrics DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Mongoose Metrics report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Get Fulfilled\n  |\n Returns data about fulfilled requests.\n  |\n|\n Customer Report\n  |\n Returns customer data.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Select the start date for your report from the date picker.\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Select the end date for your report from the date picker.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043431613\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003746\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMongoose Metrics Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,347\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:14 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mongoose_metrics_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
