If a label is vague, the chart will be harder for viewers to interpret. For example, if you had a Scatter Plot graph and you simply set the Summary Number label to \"Average,\" viewers would not know which of the two value columns in the graph you were referring to. A better label would be something like \"Average # of Employees,\" \"Average Salary,\" etc. The use of clear, specific labels is especially important when you set the size of your KPI Cards to small. In small Cards, the Summary Number is the only chart element that displays\u2014users cannot see the actual charts. If users cannot grasp the meaning of the chart from the Summary Number in this case, then the KPI Card has failed. For more information about sizing Cards, see\n                        \n                         Changing the Size of Cards in a Page\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Also, remember that certain aggregations are more appropriate for some chart types than others. If you use the wrong type of aggregation with a particular chart type, it could be detrimental to a user's comprehension of the chart. For example, the \"Current\" aggregation is most appropriate for chart types with a trendline. Using this aggregation with other chart types may not make much sense.\n                       \n\n                        Also, there are a number of chart types in which Summary Numbers actually detract from the effectiveness of the chart\u2014in these, it is recommended that Summary Numbers be turned off.\n                       \n\n                        For more information on creating effective Summary Numbers, see\n                        \n                         Effective Summary Numbers\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        The following list provides general recommendations as to the most appropriate Summary Number aggregations for each chart type:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Chart Type\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Recommended Summary Number Aggregation\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Single Bar\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Sum, Avg, Min, or Max.
