Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nYou can combine DataSets in Workbench 4 by writing SQL queries (ODBC and OLAP DataSets only)\u00a0or using Lookup Tables to create joins (all DataSet types).\u00a0This topic focuses on using Lookup Tables. For more information about writing SQL queries for ODBC and OLAP DataSets, see\n\nConnecting to an OLAP cube\n\n.\n\n\n In Workbench 4,\u00a0a \"Lookup Table\" is a DataSet you combine with a primary DataSet.\u00a0The Lookup Table\n *must*\n be saved as a DataSet job in Workbench or the join will not work. The Lookup Table DataSet and primary DataSet must both contain one column with unique matching values (\"key columns\"); that is, the values in both columns must be the same, but there cannot be duplicate values in either\u00a0column. In addition, the names of the matching columns\u00a0must be different.\u00a0(You can change\u00a0column names in Workbench if need be.) Once you match key columns, a new DataSet is created by joining all columns from both DataSets. Combining DataSets\u00a0in this way\u00a0is equivalent to using a LEFT JOIN in SQL.\n\n\n**To combine DataSets\u00a0using Lookup Tables,**\n\n. In Workbench, select your primary DataSet job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane.\n2. In the\n **Transforms**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window, click\n **Add New**\n .\n3. In the\n **Transform Type**\n menu, select\n **Lookup Table**\n then click\n **Next**\n .\n4. Click\n **Finish**\n .\n\n\n A\n **Lookup\u00a0Table**\n item is added under\n **Transforms**\n for this DataSet job.\n5. Click on the new\n **Lookup Table**\n item under\n **Transforms**\n .\n\n\n A\n **Lookup Transform**\n interface appears in the Dynamic Options panel.\n6. In the\n **Lookup Source DataSet**\n menu, select the\u00a0DataSet you intend to\u00a0combine with\u00a0your primary DataSet.\n\n\n The DataSet you select\n *must*\n be saved as a DataSet job in Workbench.\n7. In the\n **Lookup Source Key**\n menu, select the column from the Lookup Source you intend to match with a column in your primary DataSet.\n8. In the\n **Primary Key**\n menu, select the matching column.\n9. (Optional) If you want Workbench to generate an error if your Lookup Source is found to be missing, turn on\n **Error on Missing Lookup**\n .\n\n*Note:**\n If any columns in your Lookup Table have the same name as columns in your primary table, you must change those names. You can do this by selecting\n **Schema**\n for the DataSet job then making changes as necessary under\n **Destination Column**\n .\u00a0If necessary, you can also remove columns\u00a0by clearing the checkboxes for those columns under\n **Include**\n .\n10. Click\n **Save**\n in the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window.\n\nFor information about joining DataSets in Domo, see\n\nData Transformation\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360046861014\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004772\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCombining DataSets in Workbench 4\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 11,595\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "combining_datasets_in_workbench_4", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
