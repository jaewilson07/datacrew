But how can you be sure that the content you're all looking at is the same? How do you know if you brought in the right data? Using the content certification feature, you can certify your content\u00a0so your users know which content has been approved, just by looking at the Card or DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        Two types of content certification are available in Domo\u2014\"Company\" and \"Department.\" Company certification represents\u00a0pieces of content that have passed the most stringent certification review and that your entire company should be aware of. Department certification represents content that may not universally apply to the entire company\u00a0but have been certified by a specific department that trusts their information. Company- and department-certified content is\u00a0indicated using different badges.\n                       \n\n                        You can request certification for any Card or DataSet by choosing\n                        \n                         Request certification\n                        \n                        for that piece of content. If you are not the owner, the request will be sent on to the owner, who can then decide whether to start or deny the approval process.\u00a0Once the owner chooses what certification process to submit the piece of content\u00a0through, the request goes to each specified approver (or all of the members of a specified group) in the certification process that the owner chose. Approvers have the responsibility of approving or rejecting certification requests. They can also send requests back in the approval chain if changes are required.\n                       \n\n                        When groups of users are specified as approvers in the chain, if any user in the group gives his/her approval, that\u00a0approval counts for the whole group and the process moves on to the next approver.\n                       \n\n                        Different badges on a piece of content\u00a0indicate the certification tier (company or department) as well as whether the content is certified or pending certified.\n                       \n\n\n\n                         indicates that the content\u00a0was certified\u00a0through\u00a0a department certification process.\n                        \n\n\n                         indicates that certification has been requested, that the content\u00a0is pending department certification, or that the content\u2019s department certified status has expired.\n                        \n\n\n                         indicates that the content\u00a0is certified through the company certification process.\n                        \n\n\n                         indicates that the content is pending company certification or that the content's company certification status has expired.\n                        \n\n\n                        In the Certification Center, you can keep track of requests you have submitted as well as those waiting for your approval. You can see details of all requests, including the approval chain and the actions taken by each approver or group. For requests awaiting your approval, you can choose to approve or deny them here.\n                       \n\n                        The certification processes used for requesting company and department certification are found in\n                        \n                         Admin Settings > Certified Content\n                        \n                        .
