A vertical bar on the left side of the screen contains a number of different icons. Each icon provides access to a different tab for creating jobs, seeing job status, configuring security options, etc.\n\nSome of these tabs consist of only one pane, while others (such as the\n **More**\n tab\u00a0shown in the preceding screenshot) contain an additional pane that allows you to navigate between subtabs. You can hide this additional pane for a tab by clicking the\n\nicon at the top of the icon bar.\n\n\n You can use the following table to find out more about the icons in the icon bar and their associated tabs:\n\n\n Icon\n  |\n Name\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n\n|\n Toggle Menu\n  |\n Hides/shows the additional navigation pane that appears for certain tabs (such as the\n **Accounts**\n and\n **More**\n tabs).\n  |\n|\n\n|\n Home\n  |\n Opens the\n **Home**\n tab, which shows you the status and success rates for executed jobs.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n Accounts\n  |\n Opens the\n **Accounts**\n tab, in which you can add new accounts, reauthorize or delete accounts, and specify additional account configuration options.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n Jobs\n  |\n Opens the\n **Jobs**\n tab, in which you can add and configure DataSet jobs as well as see information for jobs you have added.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n More\n  |\n Opens the\n **More**\n tab, which provides access to many additional options, such as security settings, a list of registered plugins, import and export options, a log viewer, etc.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n Preview Window\n  |\n Opens the\n **Preview Window**\n tab, which allows you to open previews for any job which you have already previewed from the\n **Jobs**\n tab. A numeral next to the icon indicates that this number of jobs have previews available.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n Help\n  |\n Opens the\n **Help**\n tab, from which you can access various Domo help resources, such as videos, Knowledge Base articles, etc.\n  |\n\nEach of these panes is described in greater detail in continuation.\n\n##\n Home Tab\n\nYou can access the\n **Home**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the icon bar. In this tab, you can view the status for all DataSet jobs you have executed. The tab shows the number of total executions, the number of total rows of data uploaded to Domo, the amount of data uploaded, and the average success rate.\n\n\n###\n Accounts Tab\n\nYou can access the\n **Accounts**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the icon bar.\n\nIn this tab, you can do all of the following:\n\n Add accounts for Domo instances to which you have access by clicking the + button above the accounts list and filling in the requested information.\n* View details for different accounts by clicking the desired account name in the list on the left-side pane.\n* Change the Job Check Interval for the account (i.e. the time in minutes in which Workbench checks to see if jobs are running).\n* Specify whether certificate errors for the account are ignored.\n* Reauthorize accounts for which your credentials may have changed.\n* Revert back to the previous account settings after you have reauthorized an account (by clicking the\n\nicon\u00a0at the top of the screen\u2014only available before you save changes).\n* Delete accounts you no longer need (by clicking the\n\nicon at the top of the screen).\n* View the agent ID. This is the ID of the Domo user and machine name combination stored in Domo. This is not changeable but may be required\u00a0by support or engineering teams for troubleshooting.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAdding an Account in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n##\n Jobs Tab\n\nYou can access the\n **Jobs**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the icon bar.\n\n###\n Jobs List\n\nWhen you open the\n **Jobs**\n tab, a list of all DataSet jobs you have added appears in the pane on the left side of the window, whether they have been executed or not. Each job in the list has an icon that shows you the status of that job. Icons are as follows:\n\n\n Icon\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\n|\n Changes have been made to the job configuration that have not been saved.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n The job is saved, but no preview has been opened.\n  |\n|\n\n|\n The job is saved and a preview has been run.\n  |\n\nDetails for the currently selected job in the list appear in the right-side pane.\n\nFor any job, you can view all of the following information:\n\n The status of the job (\"Ready,\" \"Running,\" \"Disabled,\" or \"Error\").\n* The Domo\u00a0domain (account) the job is associated with. When the job is executed, the resulting DataSet is sent to this Domo domain.\n* The name of the job. You can rename a job by double-clicking the row for the job then giving the job a new name in the\n **Overview**\n subtab.\n* The DataSet\u00a0type.\u00a0The type of DataSet\u00a0that will be pushed to Domo when this job is executed (Excel, JIRA, etc.). You specify the DataSet type for a job when you create that job. Once you create the job, you\n *cannot*\n go back to change the DataSet type.\n* The date and time of the last execution of this job.\n* The successful/unsuccessful message from when you last executed the job.\n* The next scheduled run for the job (which appears blank if you have not set up scheduling for this job; for more information, see\n\nScheduling a Job in Workbench 5.1\n\n).\n\n\n####\n New Jobs Pane\n\nWhen you click the \"+\" button in the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n pane, a\n **New Jobs**\n pane appears.\n\nHere you can specify the details for your job, including the following:\n\n\n Field/Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo\u00a0Domain\n  |\n The Domo\u00a0instance you want the job to be associated with. When you execute the job, the resulting DataSet will appear in this domain. This menu is populated from accounts you add in the\n **Accounts**\n tab.\n  |\n|\n Job Name\n  |\n The name of this job as it appears in Workbench. (You specify the name of the resulting DataSet in Domo\u00a0in the\n **DataSet Name**\n field.)\n  |\n|\n Transport Type\n  |\n The type of transport, which\u00a0determines how this data source\u00a0is brought into Workbench. Options are different for each transport type.\u00a0Note that you do not specify additional options (e.g. local files, JIRA queries, etc.) until after you have created the job. Transport types are as follows:\n\n\n|\n Transport Type\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Applicable Data Sources\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n External Process File Provider\n  |\n Used\u00a0when you are\u00a0using\u00a0a\u00a0third-party application to pull data into Domo using a script.\u00a0When you use this method, you select\u00a0the executable file for your application, specify arguments, and enter\u00a0a file path for the\u00a0output. For CSV files, you can also set a\n **Direct Upload**\n option.\n  |\n Virtually any kind of executable file can be converted into\u00a0an\n\nExcel\n\n,\n\nCSV\n\n,\n\nQuickBooks\n\n,\n\nJSON\n\n, or\n\nXML\n\ndata source in Workbench. For example, you could use this method to convert a MySQL database file to an Excel file. You could then specify options for the Excel file and send it to Domo.\n  |\n|\n FTP/SFTP\u00a0File Provider\n  |\n Lets you\u00a0retrieve files via FTP, SFTP (SSH-FTP) or FTPS (FTP-SSL).\n  |\n This method is used for transporting\n\nExcel\n\n,\n\nCSV\n\n,\n\nQuickBooks\n\n,\n\nJSON\n\n, or\n\nXML\n\ndata sources into Domo.\n  |\n|\n JIRA Connection Provider\n  |\n Used to send JIRA\u00a0or JSON data to Domo.\n  |\n This method is used for transporting\n\nJIRA\n\nand\n\nJSON\n\ndata into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Local File Provider\n  |\n Lets you select a file from your machine or a network.\n  |\n This method is used for transporting\n\nExcel\n\n,\n\nCSV\n\n,\n\nQuickBooks\n\n,\n\nJSON\n\n, or\n\nXML\n\ndata sources into Domo.\n  |\n|\n ODBC Connection Provider\n  |\n Used to send data to Domo using an ODBC connection.\n  |\n Any data from a database\n  |\n|\n OLEDB\u00a0Connection Provider\n  |\n Used to send data to Domo using an OLEDB (OLAP) connection.\n  |\n Any data from a database\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Reader Type\n  |\n Determines the reader (data source) type for the data you want to bring into Domo. Different configuration options are available depending on the reader type you select. Available reader types include the following:\n\n\n|\n Reader Type\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Available For...\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n CSV\n  |\n When CSV is the selected reader\u00a0type, you can\u00a0specify the\u00a0delimiter and escape sequence characters and\u00a0configure advanced settings.\n  |\n External Process File Provider, FTP/SFTP File Provider, Local File Provider\n  |\n|\n Excel\n  |\n When\u00a0Excel is the selected reader type, you can\u00a0specify\u00a0the\u00a0range of data you want to send to Domo. This can be a specific range of cells, a named range, or a dynamic range.\n  |\n External Process File Provider, FTP/SFTP File Provider, Local File Provider\n  |\n|\n QuickBooks\n  |\n When\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0is the selected\u00a0reader type,\u00a0you can\u00a0choose from any of a variety of different reports. You can also instruct Workbench to stop QuickBooks if connection errors are encountered.\n  |\n External Process File Provider, FTP/SFTP File Provider, Local File Provider\n  |\n|\n XML\n  |\n When XML is the selected reader\u00a0type, you can specify the desired data node and also indicate nodes that should be ignored.\n  |\n External Process File Provider, FTP/SFTP File Provider, Local File Provider\n  |\n|\n JSON\n  |\n When JSON is the selected reader\u00a0type, you can specify the desired data node, the delimiter, and flattening options.\n  |\n External Process File Provider, FTP/SFTP File Provider, Local File Provider, JIRA Connection Provider\n  |\n|\n JIRA\n  |\n When JIRA is the selected Data Source type, you can\u00a0unselect\u00a0attributes from the data source that\u00a0you do not want\u00a0to be included in the DataSet. You can also add new attributes.\n  |\n JIRA Connection Provider\n  |\n|\n Database Query\n  |\n When Database Query\u00a0is the selected Data Source type, you can configure queries and replacement\u00a0variables.\n  |\n ODBC Connection Provider, OLEDB Connection Provider\n  |\n\n|\n|\n DataSet Name\n  |\n The name of the DataSet after it is imported into Domo.\n  |\n|\n DataSet Type\n  |\n The connector that represents this data after it is imported into Domo.\n  |\n|\n DataSet Description (optional)\n  |\n The description that accompanies\u00a0this DataSet after it is imported into Domo.\n  |\n\n\n####\n Job Configuration Pane\n\nIf you double-click a job in the Jobs List pane, a configuration appears with six subtabs:\n **Overview**\n ,\n **Configure**\n ,\n **Schedule**\n ,\n **Schema**\n ,\n **Notifications**\n , and\n **History**\n . These subtabs provider various options for configuring your data before sending it to Domo.\n\n\n In all subtabs, the following icons appear in the top right corner:\n\n opens a preview of the currently selected job. After you have opened a preview for a job, you can quickly see that preview again by clicking\n\nin the icon bar on left side of Workbench then selecting the desired job in the list in the left-hand pane.\n* saves the current configuration for the selected job.\n* reverts back to the previous configuration for the currently selected job.\n* executes the currently selected job (i.e. pushes the data to Domo).\n* deletes the currently selected job.\n\n\n#####\n Overview Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Overview**\n subtab for a DataSet job, you can see all of the following data:\n\n Statistics related to the last job execution, such as date and time, status, number of rows updated, etc.\n* Details specified for the job when it was initially created, such as the associated domain, job name, transport and reader type, DataSet description, etc. Of these specifications, the only ones you can change in this screen are the name of the job, the DataSet\u00a0description, and the DataSet to which you are pushing data (as described in the next paragraph). If you want to change the domain, transport/reader type, or DataSet type, you must create a new job with these changes.\n\n\n Under \"DataSet Name,\" you can change the Domo DataSet to which data is being pushed. By default, Workbench pushes your data to a new DataSet with the name you specified when you created this job. However, if you want to push data to an existing DataSet, you can click\n **Browse**\n and then pick the desired DataSet from the\n **Select DataSet**\n dialog. This dialog lists all DataSets\u00a0you have access to that have been pushed from Workbench. You can filter the DataSets in this list by type or owner and/or search for a given DataSet by name.\n\n\n#####\n Configuration Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Configuration**\n subtab for a DataSet job, you can configure various options for your job.\n\nYou can use the following table to learn more about each option:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Source\n  |\n Lets you configure the data source for the job. Options differ depending on the transport and reader type you selected when you created the job. For example, if you had specified a locally situated Excel file as your data source, you would select the desired file from your machine here. For more information about options for all transport and reader types, see\n\nSource and Processing Options\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Processing\n  |\n Lets you configure processing options for the job. Options differ depending on the transport and reader type you selected when you created the job. For example, for a CSV file, you can configure delimiters, specify how missing fields are handled, and so on. For more information about options for all transport and reader types, see\n\nSource and Processing Options\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Update Method\n  |\n Determines whether new data replaces the existing data in the DataSet or is appended to (added onto) the existing data when updating.\n  |\n|\n Add a Transform\n  |\n Lets you add transforms to your data source. Transforms allow you to modify your data locally before uploading it to Domo. A variety of transforms is available. You can add calculated fields to your data, join columns, set up encryption, and so on. For more information about transform types, see\n\nTransforms\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Requires Impersonation\n  |\n Lets you run this job as a specific Active Directory user. When this box is checked, Workbench requests non-default credentials for all DataSet Jobs (that is, the\n **Requires Impersonation**\n toggle for all Jobs is turned off and cannot be switched back on). This option is only available if you have administrator privileges.\n  |\n|\n Error Handling\n  |\n Determines what happens when errors are encountered in a DataSet Job. Options include the following:\n * **Replace invalid cells with NULL value**\n .\u00a0When invalid cells are encountered, the values are replaced with a \"NULL\" value.\n* **Skip entire row if it contains invalid data.**\n When invalid cells are encountered, the rows in which they are found are skipped.\n* **Abort job on invalid data error**\n .\u00a0When invalid cells are encountered, the entire DataSet\u00a0job is aborted.\n |\n|\n When to Terminate Long-Running Jobs\n  |\n Lets you specify a time frame (in hours) in which a long-running job is to be terminated. Options include the following:\n * **Upload even if data hasn't changed**\n . Lets you upload data to Domo even though the data has not changed. Useful when you want the DataSet freshness in Domo to be updated.\n* **Clear DataSet in Domo\u00a0Job returns\u00a0zero rows**\n . Lets you clear the DataSet in Domo if zero rows are returned when a job runs. If disabled, Workbench does not send a command to Domo to clear out data in the DataSet. If you have a process where you want to upload data in a table after data in another table has been updated, you could disable this option and add some script in your query that looks at the \"status\" table, running the query if the data is ready.\n* **Allow schema changes**\n . Allows schema changes to be pushed to Domo\u00a0when the job is left unattended.\n* **Wait for data preparation**\n . Determines whether a DataSet\u00a0must finish indexing before the job is completed.\n* **Disable job**\n . Disables the job if the specified time limit is exceeded.\n |\n\n\n#####\n Scheduling Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Scheduling**\n subtab for a DataSet job, you can choose how frequently to run a job.\n\nAvailable options include the following:\n\n **Update manually**\n . The job does not execute\u00a0on a schedule; you must run the job yourself from Workbench.\n* **Update when file is changed**\n . The DataSet job runs every time the file is updated. Not available for database data sources.\n* **Update on a schedule**\n . The job runs\u00a0on a schedule you configure. Options range from\n **Every 15 Minutes**\n to\n **Every Month**\n .\n* **Only run during a specified window**\n . The job runs on your specified schedule but only during a certain timeframe within that schedule. For example, you could instruct the DataSet to run once an hour but only between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.\n\nFor more information about updating a DataSet, see\n\nUpdating or Refreshing the DataSet for a Visualization Card\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about setting a schedule, see\n\nScheduling a Job in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n####\n Schema Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Schema**\n subtab for a DataSet job, you can make changes to your schema configuration before uploading your data to Domo, such as changing\u00a0column names and data types,\u00a0including\u00a0or excluding\u00a0certain columns, etc.\n\nYou can use the following table to learn more about the components of the\n **Schema**\n interface:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Source Column\n  |\n The name of this column in the original data source. You cannot interact with a source column; any changes you make are applied to the\n *destination*\n column (i.e. the column in the Domo DataSet after you execute this DataSet job).\n  |\n|\n Destination Column\n  |\n The name of this column in the Domo DataSet. Any changes you make to a column are applied to this column, not the column from the original data source. You can rename a destination column by clicking\u00a0in the name field and typing in the desired name.\n  |\n|\n Data Type\n  |\n Indicates the data type for the given column. You can change a data type by clicking in the field and selecting the new data type from the menu. The following data types are available:\n * LONG\n\nstores numbers as numeric values, including fractional and whole numbers.\n* DOUBLE\n\nstores double-precision floating point number values.\n* DECIMAL\n\nstores numbers as decimal values.\n* STRING\n\nstores alphanumeric characters as text.\n* DATETIME\n\nstores year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values.\n* DATE\n\nstores year, month, and day values.\n* TIME\n\nstores hour, minute, and second values.\n |\n|\n Include\n  |\n Determines whether data for this column appears in the DataSet in Domo. You can choose which columns of data are uploaded by checking or unchecking\n **Include**\n for each column heading.\n  |\n|\n Lock Data Type\n  |\n When this box is checked for a column, users cannot change the data type for that column in Domo.\n  |\n\n\n#####\n Notifications Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Notifications**\n subtab for a DataSet job, you can specify who in your Domo instance is notified when jobs are completed successfully and/or fail. For any user in your instance, you can specify whether he/she is notified\u00a0upon job\u00a0success, failure, or both.\u00a0For more information about notifications, see\n\nSetting Notifications in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n\n#####\n History Subtab\n\nIn the\n **History**\n subtab for a DataSet job, you can click\n **Open on the web**\n to view\u00a0the\n **History**\n tab for the DataSet\u00a0in the Domo instance associated with the job. For more information about this tab in Domo, see\n\nViewing DataFlow Details\n\n. You can also view local logs for this job by clicking\n **Open log viewer**\n .\n\n###\n More Tab\n\nYou can access the\n **More**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the icon bar. This tab is broken down into a number of subtabs, as follows:\n\n\n Subtab Name\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Proxy\n  |\n Lets you specify settings for more securely connecting to Domo using a proxy server.\n  |\n|\n Settings\n  |\n Lets you configure settings for managing who can run and edit jobs on this machine, optimizing system performance, and installing automatic updates.\n  |\n|\n Plugins\n  |\n Provides a list of registered plugins and also lets you register new plugins.\n  |\n|\n Import\n  |\n Lets you import DataSet jobs you previously exported.\n  |\n|\n Export\n  |\n Lets you back up and export DataSet jobs.\n  |\n|\n Log viewer\n  |\n Lets you open the Log Viewer so you can get\u00a0more information about your job runs.\n  |\n|\n Legacy schedules\n  |\n Provides information about managing job schedules you created using older versions of Workbench.\n  |\n\nAll of these subtabs are described in more detail in continuation.\n\n####\n Proxy Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Proxy**\n subtab, you can\u00a0specify settings for more securely connecting to Domo using a proxy server.\n\n*Note:**\n When you initially connect to Domo via Workbench, Workbench leverages your Windows system proxy settings; you cannot enter your proxy settings manually at this time. However, after you connect to Domo for the first time, you can manually configure the proxy settings in the\n **Proxy**\n tab.\n\n\n You can refer to the following table to find out more about the components in this tab:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n No Proxy Server\n  |\n Does\n *not*\n use a proxy server to connect.\n  |\n|\n Automatically Detect Proxy Settings\n  |\n Determines your proxy settings automatically.\n  |\n|\n Use System Proxy Settings\n  |\n Determines your proxy settings based on your system proxy settings.\n  |\n|\n Manual Proxy Configuration\n  |\n Lets you manually specify the proxy server information to use in connecting. You can do this only after initially connecting to Domo via Workbench. (The first time you connect, your system proxy settings are used.)\n\n\n You will need to enter the server address and port.\n\n\n If the proxy server requires credentials, set\n **Requires Authentication**\n to\n **On**\n , then specify the username and password.\n  |\n\nAfter you enter proxy credentials, you can test your connection by entering a test Domo URL and clicking\n **Test Proxy**\n . The color of the\u00a0icon next to this button indicates whether the proxy settings have been validated.\n\n####\n Settings Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Settings**\n subtab, you can\u00a0 configure settings for managing who can run and edit jobs on this machine, optimizing system performance, and installing automatic updates.\n\nYou can refer to the following table to find out more about the components in this tab:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Only run locally managed jobs\n  |\n If checked, Workbench runs only DataSet Jobs\u00a0managed locally,\n *not*\n those on networks.\n  |\n|\n Require impersonation credentials for all jobs\n  |\n If checked, Workbench requests non-default\u00a0credentials for all DataSet\u00a0Jobs (that is, the\n **Requires Impersonation**\n toggle for all Jobs is turned off and cannot be switched back on). This option is only available if you have administrator privileges.\n  |\n|\n Run job process as Below Normal priority\n  |\n Sets this job to \"Below Normal\" priority in your Windows Task Manager, which may be helpful in improving your processing speed when many different processes are running at once.\n  |\n|\n Limit concurrent jobs\n  |\n Lets you limit the number of DataSet Jobs that may run at the same time.\n  |\n|\n Install updates automatically\n  |\n If checked, Workbench installs all updates automatically.\n  |\n\n\n#####\n Plugins Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Plugins**\n tab, you can view all of the plugins in Workbench 5.1, with their names, publishers, version numbers, descriptions, and assembly names. You can also add a plugin to your registered plugins list by entering a search path.\n\nFor more information about adding plugins to Workbench, see\n\nManaging Plugins in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n####\n Import Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Import**\n tab, you can import jobs you previously exported from Workbench (in the\n **Export**\n tab). In the top menu, you select the Workbench account you want the imported jobs to be associated with. You can then locate the files on your machine that you want to import by clicking\n **Browse**\n and navigating to the files. Files that you select appear in the\n **Jobs to import**\n list at the bottom of the pane. Once your list is ready, click\n **Import**\n to pull the files into Workbench.\n\nFor more information about importing jobs, see\n\nBacking Up Workbench 5.1 Jobs\n\n.\n\n####\n Export Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Export**\n tab, you can export jobs in JSON format. You first choose the folder you want to save your jobs too. If you want a different save folder to be created for each account (Domo\u00a0instance), you can indicate that here. You then check the boxes for all the jobs you want to export, then click\n **Export Jobs**\n .\n\nFor more information about exporting jobs, see\n\nBacking Up Workbench 5.1 Jobs\n\n.\n\n####\n Log Viewer Subtab\n\nIn the\n **Log Viewer**\n tab, you can open the logs for your DataSet jobs by clicking\n **Open log viewer**\n . Once in the log viewer, you can filter the logs by Domo domain, job ID, and start/end date. You can choose whether or not to include service logs by checking or unchecking the\n **Include Service Logs**\n box. You can also package logs as a zip file by clicking\n **Zip Logs**\n .\n\n\n#####\n Legacy Schedules Subtab\n\nBecause legacy schedules are not supported in Workbench 5.1, you'll need to manage scripts and schedules if you want to use them. You can do this using the Workbench CLI tool. The\n **Legacy Schedules**\n tab provides access to information about this tool.\n\n###\n Preview Window Tab\n\nYou can open the\n **Preview Window**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the icon bar. This\u00a0tab allows you to open previews for any job which you have already previewed from the\n **Jobs**\n tab. A numeral next to the icon indicates that this number of jobs have previews available (for example, if the icon appeared as\n\n, this would indicate that previews had been opened for two different jobs in the\n **Jobs**\n tab).\n\n\n When you click on the\n\nicon, two panes appear. The listing pane on the left lets you choose the job you want to preview. The pane on the right is divided into two sections\u2014an\n **Output**\n section that provides log data for the preview, and a\n **Data Preview**\n section that shows the columns for your data source.\n\n\n####\n Help Tab\n\nYou can open the\n **Help**\n tab by clicking\n\nin the icon bar.

Open the Calculation Builder for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Calculated Field Transform**\n .\u00a0\u00a0In the Calculation Builder,\u00a0you can specify a name for the calculation then build your calculation by applying functions to columns in your data source as necessary. Two tabs appear in the Calculation Builder\u2014\n **Available columns**\n , which lets you choose any column in your data source to base a calculation off of,\u00a0and\n **Available functions**\n , which lets you choose functions from any of five different categories.\n\nFor\u00a0more information about building calculations, see\n\nCreating Columns in Workbench 5.1 Using Calculations\n\n.\n\n##\n Custom Date Format\n\nYou can use the\n **Custom Date Format**\n transform to\u00a0change the date format for a given column.\u00a0Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Custom Date Format Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information, see\n\nSetting a Custom Date Format on a Column in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n##\n Filter\n\nYou can use the\n **Filter**\n transform to apply filters to a selected column. You can\u00a0choose to have Workbench return matches or non-matches for the specified filter query. You can also include or exclude blank cells in your\u00a0filtered data.\n\n\n Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Filter Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information, see\n\nFiltering Columns in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n##\n Lookup Table\n\nYou can combine data sources in Workbench by using Lookup Tables.\u00a0A \"Lookup Table\" is a DataSet you combine with a primary DataSet.\u00a0The Lookup Table DataSet and primary DataSet must both contain one column with unique matching values (\"key columns\"). Once you match key columns, a new DataSet is created by joining all columns from both DataSets. Combining DataSets\u00a0in this way\u00a0is equivalent to using a LEFT JOIN in SQL.\n\n\n Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Lookup Table Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCombining DataSets in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n##\n Shift Date Timezone\n\nWith the\n **Shift Date Timezone**\n transform, you can set the time zone for\u00a0the data in a data source by selecting your desired time zone from a menu.\u00a0Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Shift Date Timezone Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information, see\n\nSetting the Time Zone for a Workbench 5.1 Job\n\n.\n\n##\n Encrypt\n\nYou can use the\n **Encrypt**\n transform to encrypt one or more columns of data in your data source. After the DataSet has been pulled into Domo, it can only be decrypted in a Sumo table, by users who have been given special access in the\n **User Access**\n listing for the DataSet job in Workbench. For more information about Sumo, see\n\nUnderstanding Sumo Cards\n\n.\n\n\n Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Encrypt Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information about encryption and decryption, see\n\nEncrypting, Decrypting, and Hashing Workbench 5.1 Data\n\n.\n\n##\n Search &\u00a0Replace\n\nYou can use the\n **Search & Replace**\n transform to replace a\u00a0specified value in a column with another value. You can also specify a default value to appear in cells in which your search value does not appear. For search and replace values you can open a regular expression builder that includes a number of categories of regular expression constructs.\n\n\n Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Search/Replace Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information, see\n\nReplacing a Column Value in Workbench 5.1\n\n.\n\n##\n Hash Value\n\nYou can use the\n **Hash Value**\n transform to encrypt data in a column\u00a0using hash values. You can choose from any of four different hash algorithms.\u00a0Open the options dialog for\u00a0this transform\u00a0for a DataSet by clicking\n **Add a transform**\n in the\n **Configuration**\n subtab and selecting\n **Hash Value Transform**\n .\n\nFor more information, see\n\nEncrypting, Decrypting, and Hashing Workbench 5.1 Data\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4407032210199\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004845\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nUnderstanding the Workbench 5.1 User Interface\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,277\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:32 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "understanding_the_workbench_51_user_interface", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_51", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapUGAS"}]}
