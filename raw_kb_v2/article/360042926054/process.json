Each account appears as an item in the list, with the name and logo of the connector, the email addresses associated with the account, and the number of DataSets being powered from this account. You can see and manage only your own accounts and the accounts that are shared with you; however, you can transfer DataSets to other users' accounts or change the accounts associated with DataSets.
