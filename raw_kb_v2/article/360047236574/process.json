For more information on how to access\n\nDomoStats\n\nreports, see\n\nDomoStats Connector\n\n.\n* This gives you the flexibility to see group-level data in Zoom and to do so from the same place that you already manage permissions and access for users.\n\nSecure your Zoom data using Personalized Data Permissions (\n\nPDP\n\n)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the potentially sensitive nature of meeting data,\n\nDomo\n\nmakes it easy to secure your data using\n\nPDP\n\nrules on your Zoom\n\nDataSets\n\n. For more information on setting up and using\n\nPDP\n\n, see\n\nPersonalized Data Permissions (PDP)\n\n.\n\n By default, Zoom day will be unfiltered with no additional\n\nPDP\n\npolicies applied.\n* Consider using\n\nDomo\n\nGroups to make sure that people only see meeting details that meet certain conditions.\n* Consider using a trusted attribute like email to create a\n\nPDP\n\npolicy to dynamically secure your Zoom data.\n* If your\n\nDomo\n\ninstance and Zoom are both integrated with your\n\nIdp\n\n, setting up\n\nPDP\n\non trusted attributes is easy and may not require joining\n\nDomo\n\nGroup data with the Zoom Users report.\n\nUnderstand your Zoom data\n---------------------------\n\nMake sure that you understand the settings that you have in your Zoom configuration in order to properly understand the data.\n\n Names of meetings in Zoom may not necessarily be the same as\u00a0the subject line of your calendar invite. For example, if you sue the Zoom extension inside of your email client, it may use a default meeting name for the Zoom meeting. For example, John Smith's Zoom Meeting or John Smith's Personal Meeting Room.\n* It is possible for somebody to join a meeting without being an authenticated user. This is a setting that is configurable for an Admin in Zoom. If your Zoom account has been configured to allow users to join a meeting without being authenticated, you may see entries in the All Meeting Participants report that have entries\u00a0such as \"Call-in User\\_1\", a phone number, or possibly a null entry.\n* In order to add more richness to your data, you may consider encouraging best practices for your users to join in certain ways so data is recorded properly.\n\n+ Encourage users to always join as an authenticated user.\n\t+ If possible, avoid direct dial-ins wherever possible.\n* What about the participant data with people outside of your organization?\n\n+ The All Meeting Participants\n\n DataSet\n\n will include the user data for any participant that joined a Zoom-hosted meeting, including those outside of your organization.\n\t+ If those users from outside your organization have a Zoom account of their own, then the user information for them will be available in the All Meeting Participants\n\n DataSet\n\n . This will include their user name and user email.\n\nAdvanced options\n------------------\n\nNeed to customize your data even more? Consider using\n\nDomo's\n\nMagic\n\nETL\n\nor MySQL\n\nDataFlows\n\nto configure things even more to meet your specialized needs. If that's not enough or there is more data form the Zoom API that you would like to see in\n\nDomo\n\n, here are some helpful resources:\n\n Zoom API Documentation\n* Create your own Connector\n* Speed up the updating cycle on a\n\ncustom Zoom Connector using a webhook\n\n.\n\nUninstalling the Zoom app from Domo\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n1.
