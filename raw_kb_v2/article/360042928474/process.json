You can use Domo's Square V2 connector to retrieve data about your product inventory, customers, refunds, and so on.\u00a0To learn more about\u00a0the Square API, go to\n\nhttps://docs.connect.squareup.com/\n\n.\n\n\n The Square V2 connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This version of the connector provides a different set of reports than the standard Square connector. For more information about the standard version, see\n\nSquare Connector\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Square V2 connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to retrieve data about inventory, sales, payments, refunds, and bank deposits.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Items in inventory\n* Payment and sales information\n* Refunded amounts\n* Cashflow going to bank account\n* Locations payments are being made\n* Amounts generated per location\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * CFO\n* Accounting\n* Sales\n* Warehouse\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n A few minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Square account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The\u00a0email address you use to log into your Square account\n* The password for your Square account\n\nConnecting to\u00a0Square\n----------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Square V2 connector\u00a0page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe\u00a0Square V2 connector uses OAuth to connect. Click\n\n*Add account**\n\nto open the\u00a0Square OAuth screen where you can enter the email address associated with your Square account and your password. An authenticated user session in Square in another browser tab should complete OAuth for the user with the active browser session. After you have entered valid\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Square V2 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you choose your report type as well as any required parameters.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Square V2 report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Catalog\n  |\n Returns information about the given merchant's\u00a0product inventory and catalog.\n  |\n|\n Customers\n  |\n Returns information about the given merchant's customers.\n  |\n|\n Locations\n  |\n Returns location information for the given merchant.\n  |\n|\n Refunds\n  |\n Returns\u00a0details for all refunds initiated by\u00a0the merchant or any of the merchant's mobile staff.\n  |\n|\n Transactions\n  |\n Returns details for all transactions initiated by the given merchant.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Date From\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **Date To**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date From\n  |\n Select the first date in your date range.\n\n\n**Note:**\n The connector will throw an error if a date range greater than 1 year is selected.\n\n\n |\n|\n Date To\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n **Date From**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date To\n  |\n Select the last date in your date range.\n\n\n**Note:**\n The connector will throw an error if a date range greater than 1 year is selected.\n\n\n |\n|\n Date From Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Date To Offset**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Date From Offset**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Date To Offset**\n , the report would contain data for\n\n10\n\ndays ago up until\n\n5\n\ndays ago.\n  |\n|\n Date To Offset\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Date From Offset**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Date From Offset**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Date To Offset**\n , the report would contain data for\n\n10\n\ndays ago up until\n\n5\n\ndays ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Ensure your credentials are valid.\n* Make sure you have reasonable date ranges. The connector will throw an error if a date range greater than 1 year is selected.\n\nFAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n How do I know my credentials are secure?\n\nThe login process uses OAuth, so your login credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. You can revoke Domo's access to your Square account at any time.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDataSets can be updated as often as once an hour. Update frequency should be decreased if rate limit errors are encountered.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nSquare does not document rate limits in its API.\n\n####\n What is the difference between the Square and Square V2 connectors?\n\nThe Square v2 connector supports Catalog, Customers, Locations, Refunds, and Transactions reports. The\n\nSquare connector\n\nsupports Items, Locations, Merchant, Payments, Payment Itemization, Refunds, and Settlements reports.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042928474\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003615\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSquare V2 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,657\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "square_v2_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
