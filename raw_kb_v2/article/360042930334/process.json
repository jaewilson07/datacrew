To learn more about the Basecamp 3 API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Basecamp 3 account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Basecamp 3 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n To connect to your Basecamp 3 account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The username or email address you use to log into Basecamp 3\n* The password you use to log into Basecamp 3\n\n\n Alternatively, if you used a Google account to set up your Basecamp 3 account, use the credentials associated with that Google account.\n\nConnecting to Your Basecamp 3 Account\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Basecamp 3 Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\n\n Credentials Pane\n\n\n The Domo\u00a0Basecamp 3 connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Basecamp 3 accounts in Domo)\u00a0to open the\u00a0Basecamp 3 OAuth screen where you can enter your Basecamp 3 username/email address\u00a0and password. Once you have entered valid\u00a0Basecamp 3 credentials and authorized Domo to connect to Basecamp 3, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Basecamp 3 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n If you are already logged into Basecamp 3 when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Basecamp 3.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Basecamp 3 report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Basecamps\n  |\n Returns a\u00a0paginated list\u00a0of active Basecamps visible to the current user, sorted by creation date.\n  |\n|\n Basecamp by Basecamp ID\n  |\n Returns the Basecamp with the provided ID.\n  |\n|\n Campfire by Basecamp ID\n  |\n Returns the Campfire with the provided Basecamp ID.\n  |\n|\n Campfires\n  |\n Returns a\u00a0paginated list\u00a0of active Campfires visible to the current user.\n  |\n|\n Client Approvals\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of client approvals.\n  |\n|\n Client Correspondence\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of client correspondences in Basecamp.\n  |\n|\n Events\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of events for the selected Recording type.\n  |\n|\n Forwards\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of Forwards for the provided Basecamp ID.\n  |\n|\n People\n  |\n Returns a list of all people visible to the authenticated user.\n  |\n|\n People by Basecamp ID\n  |\n Returns a list of people for the provided Basecamp ID.\n  |\n|\n Pingable Persons\n  |\n Returns all people in the account who can be pinged.\n  |\n|\n Recordings\n  |\n Returns a paginated list of Recordings for the provided Recording type.\n  |\n|\n Templates\n  |\n Returns a list of templates for the provided Basecamp ID and status.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Status\n  |\n Select the status you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Basecamp ID\n  |\n Select the Basecamp ID you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n|\n Type\n  |\n Select the Recording type you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930334\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003430\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBasecamp 3 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,651\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "basecamp_3_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
