Intro
-------

The Automatic app and plug-in car adapter turns just about any car into a connected car. To learn more about the Automatic API, visit their page (

https://developer.automatic.com/api-reference/#introduction

).


 You connect to your Automatic account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Automatic connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Automatic account and create a DataSet, you must have Automatic account credentials.


 Connecting to Your Automatic Account
--------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Automatic Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Automatic connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Automatic accounts in Domo) to open the Automatic OAuth screen where you can enter your Automatic credentials. Once you have entered valid Automatic credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Automatic DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Automatic when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Automatic.


###
 Details Pane

This pane contains a primary
 **Reports**
 menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.
