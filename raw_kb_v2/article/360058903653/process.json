Use Domo's\u00a0IBM Informix\u00a0Partition\u00a0connector to get your IBM Informix data into Domo based on the number of past days provided. To learn more about Informix, visit\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/...logy/informix/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Informix\u00a0data in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the IBM Informix\u00a0Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Informix account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your Informix database\n* The Informix database hostname or IP address\n* The port number for the Informix database\n* The Informix database name\n* The Informix server name\n\nBefore you can connect to an Informix\u00a0database, you must also white list a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Informix Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the IBM Informix Partition Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Informix\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Informix username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Informix password.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the Informix database. Example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n|\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number of the Informix server.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the Informix database.\n  |\n|\n Server\n  |\n Enter the name of your Informix server.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Informix credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new IBM Informix Partition DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your Informix database. You can choose a specific database table and\u00a0partition column name. You can also specify the number of past days you want to get data for.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute. Example:\n\nselect \\* from Employee\n  |\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n Select the database table you want to appear in your report.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select the partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter number of past days for which you want to get data. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. Example: 30\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ********yyyy-MM-dd********\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date Format\n  |\n Enter the custom date format you wish to apply to your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360058903653\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003969\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nIBM Informix Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,660\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "ibm_informix_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
