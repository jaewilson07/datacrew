Intro
-------

Lollipop charts are essentially modified bar charts in which the bars are represented as thin lines so you can fit more in a small area, with small circles to represent mouse-over points. There are eight types of lollipop charts in Domo, all of them modified versions of familiar bar and line bar charts.

 Powering lollipop charts
--------------------------

All lollipop charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet—one for categories, one for values, and one for series data. Beyond this, the steps for configuring these charts differ depending on the specific lollipop chart type. Each chart type has an equivalent Bar- or Line Bar-type chart. You can find out more about a specific lollipop chart type by navigating to the topic for the equivalent Bar or Line Bar chart in the following table:
