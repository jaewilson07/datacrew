There are eight types of lollipop charts in Domo, all of them modified versions of familiar bar and line bar charts.\n\n\n For thumbnail images and descriptions of all lollipop charts, see\n\nAvailable lollipop charts\n\n.\n\n\n Powering lollipop charts\n--------------------------\n\nAll lollipop charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for values, and one for series data. Beyond this, the steps for configuring these charts differ depending on the specific lollipop chart type. Each chart type has an equivalent Bar- or Line Bar-type chart. You can find out more about a specific lollipop chart type by navigating to the topic for the equivalent Bar or Line Bar chart in the following table:\n\n\n Lollipop chart Type\n  |\n Equivalent Bar or Line Bar chart Type\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Vertical grouped lollipop\n  |\n\nVertical grouped bar\n\n|\n|\n Vertical stacked lollipop\n  |\n\nVertical stacked bar\n\n|\n|\n Vertical grouped lollipop with line\n  |\n\nVertical grouped bar with line\n\n|\n|\n Vertical stacked lollipop with line\n  |\n\nVertical stacked bar with line\n\n|\n|\n Horizontal grouped lollipop\n  |\n\nHorizontal grouped bar\n\n|\n|\n Horizontal stacked lollipop\n  |\n\nHorizontal stacked bar\n\n|\n|\n Horizontal grouped lollipop with line\n  |\n\nHorizontal grouped bar with line\n\n|\n|\n Horizontal stacked lollipop with line\n  |\n\nHorizontal stacked bar with line\n\n|\n\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer,\u00a0you choose the columns containing the data for your lollipop chart.
