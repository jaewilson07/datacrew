It is a one-stop solution to manage, schedule, create, and monitor posts. Social Studio offers powerful real-time publishing and engagement.\u00a0Having a clear view of your social account performance is always essential. With Domo\u2019s Social Studio Connector, you can easily monitor the key social metrics across your social studio account.\n\n\n Use this Connector to monitor and manage different media types, posts, keywords, profiles, contents, filters, workspaces, and much more, and quickly determine your social account\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.\n\n\n To learn about the Social Studio API, see\n\nhttps://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api\\_social.meta/api\\_social/1-introduction-to-the-social-studio-marketing-cloud.htm\n\n.\n\n\n The Social Studio Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Social Studio account in the Data Center.\u00a0 This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Social Studio Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Social Studio account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password for your Social Studio account.\n* The API key and API secret associated with your Social Studio account.\n\nConnecting to Your Social Studio Account\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the Social Studio Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n\n\n**Scheduling**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nSocial Studio\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Social Studio\u00a0account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Social Studio password.\n  |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter the API key associated with your Social Studio account.\n  |\n|\n API Secret\n  |\n Enter the API secret associated with your Social Studio account.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid Social Studio credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Social Studio DataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n\n\n**Accounts**\n\n\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n\n\n**Reports**\n\n\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Social Studio report you want to run.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4416224124439\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003203\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSocial Studio Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,387\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "social_studio_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
