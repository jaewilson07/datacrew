This modifies how many properties are requested per API request. Smaller numbers can be handled better by the API, but will result in more API requests, which could cause you to go over your daily API rate limits.

Available filters can be found in the Report Filters report. Filters must be in JSON format, and any date fields in the filters must have the m/d/Y value replaced with an appropriate date string. For example, if you find daterange-start, daterange-end, or date parameters, replace m/d/Y with a string formatted like the following: 5/1/2017. If you are replacing the date parameter, this will select reports on the date of May 1st, 2017. Only include the inner filters and not the filters or filter keys. So instead of \"filters\": { \"filter\": [{\"name\": \"property\", \"required\": null},{\"name\": \"property_stats\", \"required\": true}]} you would supply the following inner array object {\"name\": \"property\", \"required\": null},{\"name\": \"property_stats\", \"required\": true}\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                           Field to Flatten\n                          \n\n\n                            Enter the column name for Entrata Data that you would like parsed and flattened to retrieve data that is normally returned as a List.
