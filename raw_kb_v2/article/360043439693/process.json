Domo already supports the industry leading protocol SAML 2.0 for SSO. The addition of OpenID Connect provides customers with a simpler, lower cost option. OpenID Connect is also better-suited than SAML 2.0 for developers, mobile users, and Domo Embed users.\n\n\n OpenID Connect can be run in conjunction with SAML, which makes it easy for users to include both internal and external personnel in a single instance. This is particularly useful for companies that already utilize a stable SSO connection for their employees\u00a0but want to extend Domo to their suppliers and customers.\n\n\n OpenID Connect is available now available for all customers.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nConfiguring Domo SSO Using OpenID Connect\n\n.\n\n##\n Custom Security Roles\n\nDomo has always provided\n\nbuilt-in security roles\n\nsuch as \"Admin,\"\u00a0\"Privileged,\" and \"Participant\"\u00a0that are used to restrict access to sensitive Domo features. These\u00a0roles govern which users in your Domo instance can perform sensitive tasks\u00a0such as exporting data, inviting users, and changing company settings. These built-in roles have not always provided the flexibility needed to meet the security needs of larger organizations. Now, with the Role Management tool, you can create and manage custom security roles, giving you\u00a0more\u00a0flexibility and finer granularity in assigning access to Domo's powerful features.\n\n\n Using Role Management, you can...\n\n Expand the list of roles beyond the current built-in roles (Admin, Privileged, Editor, Participant, and Social).\n* Manage the privileges assigned to each new role.\n* Delete unused roles.\n* Get easy reporting on the privileges and list of assigned users in each new role.\n* Use SSO\u00a0to automatically assign people to appropriate roles through a SAML\u00a0assertion at each login.\n\nYou can create as many custom roles as needed for your organization.\n\n\n This feature is available\n *on demand.*\n To request that this feature be enabled...\n\n Contact Technical Support by using\n\n/support\n\nin Buzz or by emailing\n\nsupport@domo.com\n\n.\n* Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nManaging Roles\n\n.\n\n\n Getting Help\n--------------\n\nNeed help with Domo?
