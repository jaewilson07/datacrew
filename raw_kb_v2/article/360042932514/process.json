Use this connector to export your data from a Domo DataSet to a specified Smartsheet\u00a0workspace or folder. To learn more about the Smartsheet API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/\n\n).\n\n\n You export data to Smartsheet\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Smartsheet\u00a0Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need a\u00a0Domo Client ID and Client Secret.\u00a0To create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\nand log in.\n2. Click\n **New Client**\n (found under \"My Account\" in the top right corner).\n3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n\n\n When you click\n **Create**\n , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.\n4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Smartsheet\u00a0Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID. For steps on obtaining your client ID and client secret, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID. For steps on obtaining your client ID and client secret, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Smartsheet\u00a0connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Where would you like to write this file?\n  |\n Select whether you want to send your Domo\u00a0DataSet data to a Smartsheet\u00a0workspace or folder.\n  |\n|\n Folder\n  |\n Select the Smartsheet\u00a0folder where you want to copy your data.\n  |\n|\n Workspace\n  |\n Select the Smartsheet workspace where you want to copy your data.\n  |\n|\n Prevent Duplicates?\n  |\n If you check this box, if the connector discovers a file with the same name as the file you are copying, the file will be overwritten.\n  |\n|\n Domo\u00a0DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to a Smartsheet\u00a0folder or workspace. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n|\n Select Filename\n  |\n Select how you want to choose the file\u00a0where data will be copied.\n * ****Use Input DataSet\u00a0GUID****\n . The\u00a0filename will be the number you entered for\n ****Domo DataSet ID****\n .\n* ****Use Input DataSet\u00a0Name****\n . The filename will be the same as that of the input DataSet.\n* ****Enter File Name****\n . You will give the file a\u00a0custom name in the\n ****File Name****\n field.\n |\n|\n Filename\n  |\n Enter the desired output filename.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932514\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004019\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSmartsheet Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,774\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:18 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "smartsheet_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
