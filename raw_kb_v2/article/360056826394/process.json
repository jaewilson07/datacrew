Use this connector to pull data files from your Data Lake Store into Domo. You can retrieve data files in any of the following file types: CSV, XLS, XLSX and JSON. For more information about Azure's API, see\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azu...ta-lake-store/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\u00a0account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Account key\n* Account name\n\nTo obtain credentials, please reach out to your Microsoft account representative.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 Account\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nMicrosoft Azure Data Lake Store Gen2\n\naccount.
