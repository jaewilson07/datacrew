The scientists of the USGS study the landscape of the United States, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. Use Domo's USGS Wildfires connector to retrieve the information about USGS Wildfires in ArcGIS layer metadata format. To find out more about USGS' API, see\n\nhttps://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/\n\n.\n\nYou connect to your USGS\n\nWildfires\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the USGS\n\nWildfires\n\nconnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector gives you the\n\ninformation about USGS Wildfires in ArcGIS (geographic information system) layer metadata format.\n\n|\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * The exact geographic location of the wildfire.\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * HR event planning roles\n* Facilities roles\n* Director of Operations\n* Data Analysts\n* Strategic planners\n* Disaster Management Control\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 minute\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 1\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nThis connector returns public data, so no credentials are required.\n\n\n Connecting to Your USGS Wildfires Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Details**\n pane in the USGS Wildfires Connector page.
