You can disable or delete a DataFlow in Domo. Disabling it causes any DataSets powered by the DataFlow to stop working (along with any KPI cards powered by those DataSets) but keeps the DataFlow itself intact. Deleting it disables the DataSets and cards and also removes it from Domo.

. In Domo, click
 **Data**
 in the toolbar at the top of the screen.
2. Click

in the left-hand navigation pane.
3. Locate the DataFlow you want to disable or delete.


 You can use the filter options to narrow down the DataFlows that appear in the list.
4. Mouse over the desired DataFlow then click

to display a list of options.
5. (Conditional) To disable the DataFlow, click
 **Disable**
 . To delete the DataFlow, click
 **Delete**
 .

You can also access this option from the Details view for the DataFlow.
