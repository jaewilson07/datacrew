To learn more about the Airtable API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://airtable.com/api\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Airtable account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Airtable connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Airtable account and create a DataSet, you must have an Airtable\u00a0API key. For information about obtaining an API key, go here:\n\nhttps://support.airtable.com/hc/en-u...et-my-API-key-\n\nConnecting to Your Airtable Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Airtable Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Airtable account.
