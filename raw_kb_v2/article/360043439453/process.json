This feature is found in the\n\nProfile page\n\n.\n\n\n Specifying your place in the organization\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Profile page, you can specify who you report to and who reports to you in your organization. As you and other users specify these relationships, they are added to the org chart. When changes are made to these relationships\u2014for example, if you change departments and specify a new supervisor in the Profile page\u2014the org chart is updated accordingly.\n\n\n You do not need to specify your peers (those who report to the same person as you). Domo determines these automatically when they specify the same supervisor as you.\n\n\n If you have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"Edit Users\" enabled, you can specify org chart relationships for others in your organization.\n\nFor more information about default security roles, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n*To specify your place in your company org chart,**\n\n. Open your Profile page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, a\n\nicon appears instead.)\n2. Mouse over the area to the right of the \"Reports to\" text.\n\n\n A pencil icon appears.\n3. Click the pencil icon.\n\n\n A field pops up in which you can select the name of the person to whom you report.\n4. Enter the name of the person to whom you report. As you enter letters, the names of all users matching the letters you've entered pop up in a scrollable list.\n5. Select the name you want from the list.\n6. Click\n **Save**\n .\n7. To select the names of those who report to you, click the + in the \"Reports\" area then repeat steps 4-6 for each person you want to add.\n\nViewing your org chart\n------------------------\n\nYou can view your company org chart using the Org Browser feature in the Profile page.\n\n\n**To view your company org chart,**\n\n. Do one of the following:\n\n* Open your Profile page by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen. (If you have not yet selected a profile picture, a\n\n icon appears instead.)\n\t* Open the Profile page for another user by clicking that user's profile picture anywhere it appears.\n2. Click\n **View Full Org**\n , which is found on the right side of the profile header.\n\nYour\u00a0organizational line to the CEO appears, with your superiors, peers, and reports called out. You can see other individuals and lines in the chart by searching for specific employees or clicking on different employees in the chart. These actions are described more in continuation.\n\n\n To close the Org Browser and return to the Profile page, click\n\n.\n\n##\n Understanding connections\n\nCircles with profile pictures appear for all users\u00a0in your organizational line who have specified their place in the hierarchy, starting with the CEO at the top and drilling down to\u00a0each successive individual in the line.\u00a0The selected individual's picture appears larger than the others to make it easier to spot. In addition,\u00a0that picture and the pictures of all the selected individual's superiors are connected by a thick blue line, while pictures of\u00a0the selected individual\u00a0and his or her peers and reports\u00a0are connected by a thin gray line.\n\n*Organization Explorer Example**\n\nIn the following example, the user has selected the individual named \"Blaine Mossman.\" A thick blue line connects Blaine\u00a0to his\u00a0supervisor, Andie Breiter, and continues from Chad to his supervisor, Charlie O'Brien. Blaine's four direct\u00a0reports are connected to him\u00a0by a thin gray line. In addition, Blaine's four\u00a0peers (that is, those individuals who also report to Andie\u00a0Breiter) are shown next to her, also connected by a gray line. Andie's peers are not shown\u00a0in this view, but\u00a0you could see them by clicking the circle to the left of her picture.\n\nOnly one level of reports is shown below the selected individual. In the previous example, Brett Haymond's reports are not shown because his supervisor, Blaine Mossman, is selected.\u00a0However, you can see further down the hierarchy by selecting\u00a0a report.\u00a0In the following example, the user has selected Brett Haymond, so his reports are now shown.\n\nThe\u00a0graphic\u00a0in the bottom center of\u00a0the Org Explorer (under the \"How Are You Connected?\" text)\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0selected user's\u00a0connection to the\u00a0CEO.\u00a0In the following example, the\u00a0connection line is shown between user\u00a0\"Brett Haymond\" and his CEO, Charlie O'Brien.\n\n\n###\n Viewing a user's name and position\n\nWhen you click a user's picture, their name, position, and contact information\u00a0appears at the bottom left of the Org Explorer, under \"Employee Selection.\" You can then jump directly to that user's Profile page by clicking\n **View Profile**\n . You can also send an email to the user by clicking\n **Send Email**\n . This opens your email client, with the user's email address entered automatically.\n\n##\n Searching for a user\n\nIn the top right corner of the Org Explorer, there is a\n **Search Users**\n bar you can use to search for any user in the Org Explorer. When a user is found, his or her connection line is shown, and the information in\n **How Are You Connected?**\n and\n **Employee Selection**\n is updated accordingly.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043439453\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004397\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nViewing and Entering Peers in Your Company Org Chart\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,848\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:46 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "viewing_and_entering_peers_in_your_company_org_chart", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "getting_to_know_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamsGAC"}, {"text": "user_profile", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoLGAS"}]}
