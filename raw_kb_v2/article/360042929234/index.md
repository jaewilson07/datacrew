You connect to your Crimson Hexagon account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Crimson Hexagon connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

 Access to the Crimson Hexagon Monitor API is required to use this connector.


 Best Practices

* Deploy reports for a monitor over a consistent time period.
* Social reports only pertain to monitors of the specified social platform (i.e. the Facebook reports will only return data for Facebook monitors).
