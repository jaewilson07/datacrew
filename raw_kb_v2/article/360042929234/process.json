This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Crimson Hexagon connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n Access to the Crimson Hexagon Monitor API is required to use this connector.\n\n\n Best Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* It's recommended that you deploy reports for the same monitor for comparison.\n* Deploy reports for a monitor over a consistent time period.\n* Social reports only pertain to monitors of the specified social platform (i.e. the Facebook reports will only return data for Facebook monitors).\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Crimson Hexagon account and create a DataSet, you must have your Crimson Hexagon username and password. You must also reach out to Crimson Hexagon support to enable API access for your username.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Crimson Hexagon Account\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Crimson Hexagon Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Crimson Hexagon account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Crimson Hexagon username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Crimson Hexagon password.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Crimson Hexagon credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Crimson Hexagon DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Crimson Hexagon report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Authors\n  |\n Returns information related to the Twitter authors who have posted in a given monitor.

Each of the other geography resources endpoints provides more granular views of information that appears in this endpoint.\n  |\n|\n Geography Cities\n  |\n Returns all the cities or urban areas defined in the given country that you may use to filter monitor results. Cities and urban areas may span multiple states or regions.\n  |\n|\n Geography States\n  |\n Returns all the states or country regions defined in the passed in country that you may use to filter monitor results.\n  |\n|\n Instagram Followers\n  |\n Returns the cumulative daily follower count for a targeted Instagram account in an Instagram Social Account Monitor as of the selected dates.\n  |\n|\n Instagram Sent Media\n  |\n Equivalent to Twitter Sent Posts and Facebook Admin Posts, but for media sent by admins in a targeted Instagram account.\n  |\n|\n Instagram Total Activity\n  |\n Returns information about actions made by users and admins for the selected account. The requested monitor must be an Instagram Social Account Monitor.\n  |\n|\n Interest Affinities\n  |\n Returns information about the authors in a monitor and their affinity with a range of pre-defined topics.

Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Use Local Time\n  |\n Select\n **True**\n to use the time local to the publishing author of a post instead of converting that time to the time zone of the selected monitor.\n  |\n|\n Report Daily Results\n  |\n Select\n **True**\n to have results aggregated by day of week instead of time of day.\n  |\n|\n Country Name\n  |\n Select the country you want to pull data for.\n  |\n|\n Daily\n  |\n Select\n **True**\n to have results aggregated daily instead of across the selected date range.\n  |\n|\n Team Name\n  |\n Select the team you want to pull data for.\n  |\n|\n Hide Excluded\n  |\n If you select\n **True**\n , categories set as hidden will not be included in category proportion calculations.\n  |\n|\n Geo Tagged\n  |\n Select\n **True**\n to return only geo-tagged documents.\n  |\n|\n Extended Limit\n  |\n Select\n **True**\n to increase the returned posts limit from 500 to 10,000.\n  |\n|\n Filter\n  |\n Enter a pipe-separated list of\n\nfield:value\n\npairs to filter results.\n\n\n For example:\n\n'site:\n\nblogspot.com\n\n,\n\nwordpress.com\n\n|keywords:android|geolocation:USA.NY.New York;GBR.Greater London.London'`\n |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nAfter selecting the report and monitor type, if you are not able to see the desired monitor, confirm the monitor type in your Crimson Hexagon account.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?\n\nNo. Any Crimson Hexagon account with access to collected data should be usable to set up this connector.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDatasets should be set to update once a day.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nThe Crimson Hexagon API limits each authenticated user to 120 requests per minute. Note that a single dataset run may make multiple requests to the API.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042929234\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003531\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCrimson Hexagon Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,657\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "crimson_hexagon_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
