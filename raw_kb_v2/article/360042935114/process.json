The following screenshot shows an example of a card with sample data:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        The process for powering up Business-in-a-Box dashboards with live data is similar to that of deploying apps from the Appstore. You select a DataSet containing all of the columns (fields) required to power up the cards in this dashboard. Then you drag columns from your DataSet onto the matching columns in the dashboard. (If the columns have the same name, they are matched automatically.) You must do this for all individual DataSets required to power up the dashboard. This process is described in greater detail below. For information about deploying Appstore\u00a0apps, see\n                        \n                         Deploying Apps from the Appstore\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Notes:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                              If you do not have an \"Admin\" or \"Privileged\" security role\u00a0in Domo (or a custom role with \"Use Appstore\" enabled), you cannot power up cards in a Business-in-a-Box dashboard; however, you can send a request that cards in the dashboard be powered up.
