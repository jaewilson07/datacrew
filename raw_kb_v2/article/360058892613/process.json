Health Level Seven or HL7 refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers. Use Domo's HL7 Writeback connector to convert the DOMO dataset data into an HL7 message. Once the HL7 messages are constructed for all the items in the dataset, the connector will create a file that will get SFTP'ed to a specific location.\n\n\n You export\u00a0Domo data to\u00a0HL7 in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the HL7 Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector\u00a0and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The hostname\u00a0used to connect to SFTP server\n* The port number\u00a0used to connect to SFTP server\n* The username and password for the SFTP server\n\nConfiguring\u00a0the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nHL7 Writeback\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nHL7\u00a0dataset\n\n. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Hostname\n  |\n Enter the hostname used to connect to SFTP server.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number\u00a0used to connect to SFTP server.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username of the SFTP server.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password of the SFTP server.\n  |\n|\n SSH Private Key\n  |\n Enter the SSH private key (DES or RSA), in PEM format.\n  |\n|\n Passphrase\n  |\n Enter the SFTP server passphrase.\n  |\n\nYou can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-\n\nHL7\n\nconnection.\n\nYou can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Path\n  |\n Enter the SFTP file location.\n  |\n|\n Select Filename\n  |\n Select whether you would like to use the input dataset guide or enter the output filename manually.\n  |\n|\n Filename\n  |\n Enter the output file name.\n  |\n\n\n####\n**Form of the Input Dataset**\n\nThe HL7\u00a0Writeback connector maps columns to fields in an HL7 message. This version of the connector supports a hard coded mapping between columns and fields. Thus, you must use the correct column names to use this connector. Here's the current list of columns with the quoted string (the exact column name you need to use).\n\n\n Field Name\n  |\n Column Name\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Accession Number\n  |\n \"AccessionNumber\"\n  |\n|\n Lab Result\n  |\n \"LabResult\"\n  |\n|\n Lab Test Date\n  |\n \"LabTestDate\"\n  |\n|\n NTE Comment 1\n  |\n \"NTE Comment 1\"\n  |\n|\n NTE Comment 2\n  |\n \"NTE Comment 2\"\n  |\n|\n NTE Comment 3\n  |\n \"NTE Comment 3\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Given Name\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderGivenName\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Last Name\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderLastName\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Phone Number\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderPhoneNumber\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Title\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderTitle\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Facility\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderFacility\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Street\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderStreet\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider City\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderCity\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider State\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderState\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Provider Zip Code\n  |\n \"OrderingProviderZip\"\n  |\n|\n Ordering Facility Street\n  |\n \"OrderingFacilityStreet\";\n  |\n|\n Ordering Facility State\n  |\n \"OrderingFacilityState\";\n  |\n|\n Ordering Facility City\n  |\n \"OrderingFacilityCity\";\n  |\n|\n Ordering Facility Zip Code\n  |\n \"OrderingFacilityZip\";\n  |\n|\n Patient ID\n  |\n \"PatientId\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Date of Birth\n  |\n \"PatientDOB\"\n  |\n|\n Patient First Name\n  |\n \"PatientFirstName\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Last Name\n  |\n \"PatientLastName\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Sex Code\n  |\n \"PatientSexCd\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Phone Number\n  |\n \"PatientPhone\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Address Street\n  |\n \"PatientAddressStreet\";\n  |\n|\n Patient Address City\n  |\n \"PatientAddressCity\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Address State\n  |\n \"PatientAddressState\"\n  |\n|\n Patient Address Zip Code\n  |\n \"PatientAddressZip\"\n  |\n|\n Specimen Collection Date\n  |\n \"SpecimenCollectionDate\"\n  |\n|\n Specimen Source Code\n  |\n \"SpecimenSourceCd\"\n  |\n|\n Specimen Identifier\n  |\n \"SpecifmenIdentifier\"\n  |\n|\n Specimen Code\n  |\n \"SpecimenCode\"\n  |\n|\n Performing Facility\n  |\n \"PerformingFacility\"\n  |\n|\n Performing Facility Street\n  |\n \"PerformingFacilityStreet\"\n  |\n|\n Performing Facility City\n  |\n \"PerformingFacilityCity\"\n  |\n|\n Performing Facility State\n  |\n \"PerformingFacilityState\"\n  |\n|\n Performing Facility Zip Code\n  |\n \"PerformingFacilityZip\"\n  |\n|\n Ordered Test Name\n  |\n \"OrderedTestName\"\n  |\n|\n Ordered Test Identifier\n  |\n \"OrderedTestIdentifier\"\n  |\n|\n Ordered Test Code\n  |\n \"OrderedTestCode\"\n  |\n|\n Sending Facility\n  |\n \"SendingFacility\"\n  |\n|\n Sending Facility ID\n  |\n \"SendingFacilityId\"\n  |\n|\n Sending Facility Code\n  |\n \"SendingFacilityCode\"\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360058892613\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004007\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nHL7 Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,426\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "hl7_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
