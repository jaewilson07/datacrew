These include:\n\n Calculator\n* Date Operations\n\nFor information about creating a Magic ETL DataFlow, see\n\nCreating a Magic ETL DataFlow\n\n.\n\n\n For information about the Data Center, see\n\nData Center Layout\n\n.\n\n\n**Important:**\n There are significant behavioral differences in the new Magic ETL. Read the\n\n\n Behavior Changes and Feature Updates in Magic ETL\n\n\n article before converting mission-critical Magic ETL DataFlows.\n **Failure to do so may risk an unintended change to your DataFlow\u2019s behavior.**\n\nCalculator Tile\n-----------------\n\n\n The Calculator tile\u00a0lets you add a column with values from a simple calculation.\n\n\n Do the following to configure the\n **Calculator**\n tile:\n\n. Click the\n **Calculator**\n tile in the canvas.\n2. (Optional) Rename the tile by clicking\n\n, then entering the name you want.\n3. Enter the name of the new column.\n4. Select the operation you want.\n\n\n|\n Operation\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Addition\n  |\n Adds values from two columns.\n  |\n|\n Subtraction\n  |\n Subtracts values from two columns.\n  |\n|\n Multiplication\n  |\n Multiplies values from two columns.\n  |\n|\n Division\n  |\n Divides values from two columns.\n  |\n|\n Ceiling\n  |\n Returns the highest value for each series in a numeric column.\n  |\n|\n Floor\n  |\n Returns the lowest value for each series in a numeric column.\n  |\n5. Select the columns to use or specify the values you want.\n\n\n**Tip:**\n You can preview the data transformed by a tile\u00a0by running a preview, clicking the tile in the canvas, then clicking the\n **Preview**\n tab.\n\nDate Operations Tile\n----------------------\n\n\n The Date Operations tile\u00a0lets you add\u00a0a column with values from a date-based calculation.\n\n\n Do the following to configure the\n **Date Operations**\n tile:\n\n. Click the\n **Date Operations**\n tile in the canvas.\n2. (Optional) Rename the tile by clicking\n\n*Edit**\n ,\u00a0then entering the name you want.\n3. Enter the name of the new column.\n4. Select the date operation you want.\n\n\n|\n Operation\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Add\u00a0to date\n  |\n Returns the result of adding a unit of measurement\u00a0to values in a date column. Units of measurement include\u00a0months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.\n  |\n|\n Subtract from date\n  |\n Returns the result of subtracting a unit of measurement from values in a date column. Units of measurement include months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds.\n  |\n|\n Difference between dates\n  |\n Returns the difference in a unit of measurement between two dates. Units of measurement include days, working days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds.\n  |\n|\n Year of date\n  |\n Returns the year for values in a date column.\n  |\n|\n Quarter of date\n  |\n Returns the quarter for values in a date column.\n  |\n|\n Month of date\n  |\n Returns the month for values in a date column.\n  |\n|\n Day of year\n  |\n Returns the numerical day of the year for values in a date column.\n  |\n|\n Day of month\n  |\n Returns the numerical day of the month for values in a date column.\n  |\n|\n Day of week\n  |\n Returns the numerical day of the week for values in a date column.\n  |\n|\n Week of year\n  |\n Returns the numerical week for values in a date column.\u00a0Weeks are Sun-Sat. Week 1 is the first week with a Saturday in this year.\n  |\n5. Select the columns to use or specify the values you want.\n\n\n**Tip:**\n You can preview the data transformed by a tile\u00a0by running a preview, clicking the tile in the canvas, then clicking the\n **Preview**\n tab.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360045402313\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003003\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMagic ETL Tiles: Dates and Numbers\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,805\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 8:59 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "magic_etl_tiles_dates_and_numbers", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "magic_etl", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanvGAC"}, {"text": "tiles", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZdTHGA0"}]}
