Sunlight Labs Congress is a public resource website for understanding and tracking the U.S. Congress. Use Domo's Sunlight Labs Congress connector to retrieve data about activity in the U.S. Congress, such as legislation, hearings, roll call votes, and more. To learn more about the Sunlight Congress API, visit their page (

https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/

).


 You connect to your Sunlight Labs Congress account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sunlight Labs Congress connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Sunlight Labs Congress account and create a DataSet, you must have a Sunlight Congress API key.


 Currently Sunlight Congress's API registration page is down. We are working to figure out how to get around this situation.
