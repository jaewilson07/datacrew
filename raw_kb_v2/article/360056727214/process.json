For example, some DataSets may be used strictly as\u00a0DataFlow inputs or have not been accessed for a while and\u00a0therefore\u00a0are not being actively queried (i.e. used and viewed regularly in Cards or Dashboards). These DataSets will continue to run as scheduled, perform normally as expected, and are optimized for their current use, but must be brought into an actively queried state to use in visualizations.\n\n\n DataSets that cannot be actively queried\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a DataSet is not optimized for querying, the following message will appear in the DataSet Details.\n\nYou will also be notified of a DataSet's\u00a0status when you\u00a0click\n **Open With**\n menu in\u00a0the DataSet Details view. You must bring the DataSet back to an actively queried state\u00a0to begin building new content with it.\n\n\n###\n Bringing DataSets to an actively queried state\n\nTo optimize a DataSet\u00a0for querying\u00a0to be used in Cards, Dashboards, and more, click the\n **Start**\n button in the Details View Overview tab. You may begin using that DataSet\u00a0as soon as it is done preparing.\n\n\n####\n From the Data Center\n\n\n1. Navigate to the\n\nData Center\n\nand search for the DataSet\u00a0you want to actively query.\n2. Click on the DataSet\u00a0to view the Overview tab in the DataSet Details.\n3. Click\n **Start**\n .\n\n\n####\n In Analyzer\n\n\n1. In Analyzer, you will be presented with the following message if a DataSet is not actively queried.\n2. Click\n **Get Details**\n to be taken directly to the DataSet\u00a0Details view.\n3. Click\n **Start**\n .\n\n\n####\n From\u00a0Card Details\n\n\n1. In the Card Details view, you will be presented with the following message if a DataSet is not actively queried.\n2. Click\n **Get Details**\n to be taken directly to the DataSet Details view.\n3. Click\n **Start**\n .\n\n\n####\n In DataFusions\n\n\n1. In DataFusions, you will be presented with the following message if a DataSet you are attempting to use as an input is not actively queried.\n2. Navigate to the Data Center.
