Intro
-------

Not all DataSets are created equal. For example, some DataSets may be used strictly as DataFlow inputs or have not been accessed for a while and therefore are not being actively queried (i.e. used and viewed regularly in Cards or Dashboards). These DataSets will continue to run as scheduled, perform normally as expected, and are optimized for their current use, but must be brought into an actively queried state to use in visualizations.


 DataSets that cannot be actively queried
------------------------------------------

When a DataSet is not optimized for querying, the following message will appear in the DataSet Details.

You will also be notified of a DataSet's status when you click
 **Open With**
 menu in the DataSet Details view. You must bring the DataSet back to an actively queried state to begin building new content with it.
