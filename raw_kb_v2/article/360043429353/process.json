For example, the following screenshots shows a Spark Line chart in which the COGS value has fallen 74.35% from an initial value of $6.68K.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        By default, the gauge\u00a0shows the degree of change between the first and last data items\u00a0in the chart; however, you can change this to show the degree of change for the last two data items if you want. You can also change other aspects of Spark Line charts, such as whether the degree of change is a percentage or a value, whether it appears as green or red, the fill color for the chart, etc. You can make all of these changes in the Chart Properties for the chart.\n                       \n\n                        As with most other chart types, Spark Line charts include hover labels that show the specific data for each data point. So even though there are no axes, users can still ascertain\u00a0values for data points by mousing over them. For more information about hover labels, see\n                        \n                         Formatting Data Label and Hover Text in Your Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Powering Spark Line charts\n                       \n\n                        Spark Line charts require only two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one for categories (generally dates or times) and one for values. As with most other Line charts, categories are represented along the horizontal axis and values are represented on the vertical axis (though these are not shown in a Spark Line chart for the sake of simplicity). To build a Spark Line in Analyzer, you drag your category column into the \"X Axis\" field and your value column into the \"Y Axis\" field.\n                       \n\n                        For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Spark Line chart.
