To create new Google Drive DataSets, use this connector. All pre-existing Google Drive DataSets will continue to run normally.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nGoogle Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google that allows users to store files in the cloud, synchronize files across devices, and share files. Use Domo's\u00a0Google Drive Service connector to retrieve Excel and CSV files from a Google Drive account and output them as Domo DataSets. To learn more about the Google Drive API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/drive/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Google account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Drive connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a Google service account, you must have a Google service account JSON key.\n\n\n Before creating your service account JSON key, you need to first enable the\n\nGoogle Drive API for your project in Google Cloud Platform console.\n\n\n####\n Enabling the Google Drive API\n\n\n To enable the Google Drive API for your project, do the following:\n\n\n 1. Go to the\n\nGCP Console\n\n.\n\n\n 2. Click\n **Library**\n under\n **APIs and services**\n in the left pane.\n\n3. Search for the\n **Google Drive API**\n and click on it.\n\n\n 4. Towards the top of the screen you will see an\n **ENABLE**\n button.\n\n5. Click\n **Enable**\n .\n\n\n####\n To generate a service account JSON key, do the following:\n\n1. In the\n\nGCP Console\n\n, open the\n ****IAM\u00a0& Admin****\n page.\n\n\n 2. Click\n ********Service accounts********\n in the left-hand navigation pane.\n\n3. Click\n ********Create Service Account********\n .\n\n\n 4. In the\n\n\n**Service account details**\n\n\n section, enter a name and description for the service account.\n\n\n 5. Click\n\n\n**Create and Continue**\n .\n\n\n 6. Now, in the\n\n\n**Grant this service account access to the project**\n\n\n section, click\n\n\n**Select a role**\n\n\n drop down.\n\n\n 7. Select\n\n\n**Project-> Owner**\n .\n\n8. Click\n\n\n**Continue**\n .\n\n\n 9. Click\n\n\n**Done**\n . An overview of your service account will appear.\n\n\n 10. In the\n\n\n**Actions**\n\n\n column, click the three dots to expand the menu. Click\n\n\n**Manage Keys**\n .\n\n11.\n\nClick\n\n*Add Key**\n\n. Select\n\n*Create new key**\n\n.\n\n\n 12.\n **Create private key**\n\n\n window will appear. Select private key type as\n\n\n**JSON**\n\n\n and click\n\n\n**Create**\n .\n\n\n 13. A private key will be saved to your computer.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Google Service Account\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google Drive Service Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to a Google service account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Service Account Key JSON\n  |\n Copy and paste the JSON for your Google service account key. For information about creating a key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered a valid key,\u00a0you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google Drive\u00a0Service DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ********Accounts********\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane, you can choose to import a list of files in your Google Drive account or specify a Google Drive file to import into Domo and set options for how you want the data to appear.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select whether you want to import a list of files (\"Files\") or download a specific files (\"FileDownload\").\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Files\n  |\n Returns list of files in drive.\n  |\n|\n File Download\n  |\n Imports a file from google drive into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Fetch Data from Shared Drives\n  |\n Select\n **Yes**\n if you want the connector to fetch data from the Shared Drives.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n How Would You Like to Choose Your File?\n  |\n Select how you want to choose the file you intend to import into Domo.
