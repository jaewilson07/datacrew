With Integration Studio\u00a0you can configure a Connector, build your pipeline, and then configure your Writeback Connector all from the Magic ETL canvas.\n\n\n**Note:**\n Integration Studio is enabled after you purchase a Writeback Connector. For a list of available Writeback Connectors, see\n\nWriteback Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Using Integration Studio\n--------------------------\n\n1. Drag the\n **Input DataSet**\n tile onto the Magic ETL Canvas.\n\n2. Choose\n **Select DataSet**\n and then either choose a pre-existing DataSet or\n **Create New**\n to configure a new Connector.\n\n3. Search for the Connector you want in the Search Connectors Box.\n\n4. Configure each step of the Connector Wizard and select\n **Save**\n to finish. Your DataSet will build and the columns will appear in the\n **Configuration**\n section.\n\n5. Add more tiles to cleanse and manipulate your data if desired.\n\n\n 6. Drag the\n **Writeback**\n tile onto the Canvas found in the\n **DataSets**\n section of Magic ETL.\n\n\n 7. Name the output DataSet and add an optional description. Then, select\n **Configure Writeback**\n .\n\n8. Select the Writeback Connector you would like to use.\n\n9. Set up the Connector configuration\u00a0(you will need a Client ID and Secret from\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\n.)\n\n10. Choose,\n **O**\n**n dataset update**\n to update the Writeback DataSet whenever the DataFlow runs, or set a schedule to run at specified times.\n\n11. Choose\n **Save and Run**\n to run your DataFlow and the Writeback Connector.\n\nYour Writeback Connector is now properly configured and you can continue to build your Magic ETL\u00a0DataFlow.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360045163773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004575\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nIntegration Studio\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,945\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "integration_studio", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "magic_etl", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanvGAC"}]}
