In the Analyzer for a Visualization card, you can change the visual characteristics of the chart.


 The Analyzer is only available for users with a default security role of Editor or higher (or a custom role with the Edit Cards grant enabled). Also, if the "Only the owner and administrators" checkbox in the bottom left corner of the Details view has been selected, you can only display Analyzer if you have an Admin security role (or a custom role with the Manage All Cards and Pages grant enabled) or you have been assigned as the card owner.
