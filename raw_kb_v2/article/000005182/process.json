If any installations of the app are already deployed to your Domo instance, you have the option to request access to an existing version or to deploy a new version.\n                       \n\n                        When you deploy an app, Domo first installs the app card(s) with sample data. Cards with sample data display with a label reading\n                        \n                         Sample\n                        \n                        to indicate they are not yet live.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        After you deploy an app, look over the app card(s) to make sure this app is what you need. When you are ready, you can power up the cards in the app with live data by connecting to a third-party connector account (Dashboard apps) or DataSet with matching columns (all other apps). You can also assign another user to power up the app.\n                       \n\n                        Follow these steps to deploy an app to Domo:\n                       \n\n\n                         In the navigation header, select\n                         \n                          Appstore\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         In the Appstore, search for and find the app you want to add.
