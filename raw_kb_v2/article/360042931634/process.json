Use Domo's Amazon Redshift Unload V2 connector to bring in larger results from Redshift through the assistance of your Amazon S3 service.\n\n\n You connect to your Amazon Redshift Unload account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon Redshift Unload connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to Amazon Redshift\u00a0so you can begin creating Amazon Redshift Unload\u00a0DataSets, you must have the following:\n\n The host name for the Redshift database\n* The database name you created for the cluster\n* Your Redshift username and password\n* The port number you specified when you launched the cluster\n* Your AWS access key\n* Your AWS secret access key\n* The name of the S3 bucket data will be unloaded into\n* The name of the S3 bucket region\n\nCA certificate text or URL path is required\n **only**\n if you select\n ****Certificate string****\n or\n ****URL path****\n ,\u00a0respectively, in the\n ****Certificate format****\n menu.\n\n\n If you do not know any of the information for Redshift, contact your Amazon Redshift Database Administrator.\n\n\n If you have a firewall, ensure the port is open for you to use.\n\n\n To find your AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key:\n\n.
