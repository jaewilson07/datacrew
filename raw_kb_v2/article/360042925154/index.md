Intro
-------

You can apply advanced properties to a chart using the
 **Chart Properties**
 tool. This can be found in the Analyzer for a chart, to the right of the chart. Setting properties to a chart can have far-reaching effects, so you can reset them if needed.


 Understanding chart properties
--------------------------------

Available chart properties are different for each chart. Most charts have a specific set of categories of chart properties. For example, the Vertical Bar chart includes categories for
 **General**
 ,
 **Bar Settings**
 ,
 **Data Label Settings**
 , etc. Clicking any category in the Chart Properties brings up the available properties within that category. For example, for the Vertical Bar chart, clicking
 **General**
 would display properties for changing the font size, sorting on totals, and disabling animations.


 A number to the right of a category name indicates the number of enabled properties within that category. In the following example, one property has been set within
 **General**
 , two have been set within
 **Bar Settings**
 , and so on.
