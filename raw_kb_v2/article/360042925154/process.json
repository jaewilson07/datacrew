This can be found in the Analyzer for a chart, to the right of the chart. Setting properties to a chart can have far-reaching effects, so you can reset them if needed.\n\n\n Understanding chart properties\n--------------------------------\n\nAvailable chart properties are different for each chart. Most charts have a specific set of categories of chart properties. For example, the Vertical Bar chart includes categories for\n **General**\n ,\n **Bar Settings**\n ,\n **Data Label Settings**\n , etc. Clicking any category in the Chart Properties brings up the available properties within that category. For example, for the Vertical Bar chart, clicking\n **General**\n would display properties for changing the font size, sorting on totals, and disabling animations.\n\n\n A number to the right of a category name indicates the number of enabled properties within that category. In the following example, one property has been set within\n **General**\n , two have been set within\n **Bar Settings**\n , and so on.\n\n\n**Video - Applying and Resetting Chart Properties**\n\nApplying chart properties\n---------------------------\n\nTo set properties for a chart, you must first\n\nAnalyzer Layout\n\n.\n\n\n**To\u00a0apply Chart Properties,**\n\n.
