It simplifies the process by automating administrative tasks, providing key details to make data-driven decisions, and delivering an amazing digital experience to customers. It helps space administrators focus on work, get access to required knowledge, and connect with like-minded professionals to enable sustainable growth in their business.\n\n\n The Domo OfficeRnD connector enables you to retrieve various details about bookings, credits, contracts, offices, payments, and more. When you connect OfficeRnD with Domo, you\u2019ll see all the critical data you need to manage your workspaces along with costs and customer management. Your team will be able to use this data to have an all-in-one view of how your business is functioning and where potential problems may occur.\n\n\n You can create powerful visualizations and reports to track all the data your OfficeRnD solution captures to keep your business running. Combine your OfficeRnD data with all your information on Domo to see how your workspaces affect your bottom line and plan for future business demands.\n\nTo learn more about the\n\nOfficeRnD\n\nAPI, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.officernd.com/docs\n\n).\n\n\n The\n\nOfficeRnD\n\nConnector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nOfficeRnD\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nour Officernd API\n\nConnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\n\nOfficeRnD\n\naccount and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The client ID and client secret associated with y\n\nour OfficeRnD API.\n* The Organization name for your OfficeRnD environment. You can find this in the API URL. For example, if your API URL is \"\n\nhttps://app.officernd.com/api/v1/organizations/domo\"\n\n\" then your organizations is \"domo\".\n\nConnecting to Your\n\nOfficeRnD\n\nAccount\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes in the\n\nOfficeRnD\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nOfficeRnD\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter the client ID associated with your OfficeRnD API.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter the client secret associated with y\n\nour OfficeRnD API.\n\n|\n|\n Organization\n  |\n Enter t\n\nhe Organization name for your OfficeRnD environment. You can find this in the API URL.\n\n\n For example, if your API URL is \"\n\nhttps://app.officernd.com/api/v1/organizations/domo\"\n\n\" then your organizations is \"domo\".\n\n|\n\nOnce you have entered valid\n\nOfficeRnD\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nOfficeRnD\n\nDataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\nOfficeRnD\n\nreport you want to run.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4624885410583\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003183\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nOfficeRnD Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,637\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "officernd_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
