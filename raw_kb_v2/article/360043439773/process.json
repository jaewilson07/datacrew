That's why we've created the Connector IDE, an intuitive environment for managing and creating connections between Domo and the web's most powerful APIs. If there isn't a connector built for an API you use in the AppStore, you now have the ability to build it.\n\n\n For documentation about building custom connectors in Domo, see\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/connect-to-domo\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043439773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004627\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nBuilding Custom Connectors in Domo\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,007\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "building_custom_connectors_in_domo", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "using_domo_apis", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan1GAC"}, {"text": "developer_topics", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanYGAS"}]}
