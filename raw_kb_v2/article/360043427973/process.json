You can choose to display calendar data for an entire year, for a month, or for a single day.\n                       \n\n                        A calendar requires two columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014one contains the dates and the other contains the\u00a0number of category items\u00a0corresponding to\u00a0each date.\u00a0You can also include an optional values column.\u00a0The background color for a date determines how many items are associated with the date, or, if a values column is present, the amount for each date. If there are multiple instances of a certain date, the amounts for the date are summed. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        By default, Domo uses the\n                        \n                         Auto\n                        \n                        view to display your calendar, which depends on the breadth of data in the DataSet. If the data in your DataSet spans multiple months, the calendar automatically shows data in the\n                        \n                         Year\n                        \n                        view. If the data in the DataSet spans a few days or weeks within the same month, the calendar automatically shows data in the\n                        \n                         Month\n                        \n                        view.

For example, if your DataSet contained data for a year, you could tell Domo to show data for a single month by selecting\n                        \n                         View > Month\n                        \n                        in\n                        \n                         Chart Properties\n                        \n                        .
