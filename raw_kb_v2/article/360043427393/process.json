This is a keyword-specific search, so searching for \"sales\" would return only those items. You can use quotation marks around search terms when you want to search for the term as a whole instead of the individual words. Boolean operators and wildcards are supported.\n                        \n\n                         Your search returns only those items that you have sufficient access rights to view.

For example, search results for Cards show you the Card type and\u00a0the owner and the number of views. Search results for people show you their contact information (if it has been entered in their Profile Page). Clicking a search result usually opens the associated item in Domo. For example, clicking a Buzz message opens the parent conversation in Buzz with that message selected; clicking a Card opens the Card Details view; and so on.\n                        \n\n                         Performing a basic search\n                        \n\n                         To perform a basic global search in Domo, you simply open the Search interface by clicking the magnifying glass icon\n                         \n                         in the toolbar at the top of the screen, then enter your search term into the\n                         \n                          Search Domo\n                         \n                         field.
