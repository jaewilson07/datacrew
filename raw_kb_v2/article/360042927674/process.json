In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your\u00a0Bazaarvoice account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Bazaarvoice\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Retrieving answer data from reviews for certain products/categories.\n* Determining product/category sentiment.\n* Reviewing specific feedback customers are providing about products/categories.\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Top/bottom product ratings\n* Reviewer satisfaction levels\n* Campaign sentiment\n* Average product ratings\n* Reviewer demographics\n* Number of product reviews per product\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Marketing director\n* Marketing manager\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 15-30 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nIf you have a large number of products/categories, consider running reports on only the products/categories you'd like to see.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0Bazaarvoice account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The base URL for your Bazaarvoice instance.
