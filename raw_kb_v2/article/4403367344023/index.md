Intro
-------

Domo Sandbox is a premium feature that allows users to follow and manage a development lifecycle for Domo dashboards and other objects.


 Here are some terms you should know before using Domo Sandbox:


 Term
  |
 Definition
  |
| **Repository**  |
 The collection of objects that are being versioned. Over time, multiple versions of the selected objects are stored. An example of what might be included is a dashboard (including cards, Beast Modes, images, etc.)
  |
| **Version**  |
 A snapshot of a repository at a given point in time. A repository can have multiple versions.
  |
| **Commit**  |
 The action taken to store a new version. This results in a new snapshot of the Domo objects.
  |
| **Promote**  |
 The action taken to create or update the objects in the destination Domo instance. An example is promoting a dashboard to production. This creates the dashboard the first time it is promoted or updates the dashboard on subsequent promote actions.
  |
| **Same Instance Promotion**  |
 Promoting a repository in the same instance where it was created. Use this when you want to be able to manage the versioning process in the same Domo instance.
  |
| **Source Instance**  |
 The location of the source objects. This is typically a development or sandbox Domo instance.
  |
| **Destination Instance**  |
 The location where the objects are updated. This is typically production instance.

Sandbox supports both cross instance and same instance promotion. If cross instance promotion is desired, please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to have an instance provisioned.


 Instance Relationships
------------------------

1. Log into your source instance (see the table in

* In the
 **Advanced**
 tab, apply settings as necessary. Renaming/removing strings from object names is available primarily to facilitate same instance promotion, but can be used when promoting across instances.

6. Select

###
 Grant Examples

To administer Sandbox for a Domo instance, including establishing repository sharing relationships, enabling same-instance promotion, and requiring approval for promotion, a user must:

 Have the Administer Sandbox grant

To create a new repository and/or commit content changes to a repository, a user must:

 Have the “Manage Repositories” grant (and/or the “Administer Sandbox” grant”)
* Have the “Manage All Cards and Pages” grant (only required for committing page-type repositories)
* Be the owner of the repository or have had the repository shared with them.
	+ “Can Commit” can commit only
	+ “Can Edit” can edit the repository content and sharing but cannot delete
	+ “Co-Owner” can edit and delete the repository
* Be the owner of the content being committed or have had the content shared with them


**Note:**
 The content must be owned or explicitly shared, not merely accessible via Domo Admin-level grants.

To manage incoming shared repositories, including assigning ownership of the repository and establishing a promote approval process, a user must:

 Have the Administer Sandbox grant

To promote a repository, a user must:

 Have the Manage Repository Promotions grant (and/or the Administer Sandbox grant)
* Be the owner of the repository or have had the repository shared with them
	+ “Can Promote” can promote only
	+ “Can Edit” can edit the repository (i.e., dataset mappings, renaming, etc.) and promote
* Be included in at least one Personalized Date Permissions (PDP) policy for each DataSet (on which PDP is enabled) used in any cards or dashboards in the repository
* Be the owner of the content (or, for cards or dashboards, have had the content shared with the promoting user if the promoting user also has the Manage All Cards and Pages grant).

*Note:**

 The content must be owned or explicitly shared; not merely accessible via Domo Admin-level grants.
* If the repository has never been promoted, the user promoting the repository will be the owner of content created during the promotion.

FAQs
------

*What Domo objects are supported?**


 Dashboards (includes subpages, cards, Layouts, files, Apps, etc.), DataFlows, Connectors, and Views. We plan to add additional objects over time and welcome feedback to help prioritize.


**Are raw data sources supported?**


 Yes. When creating a repository and selecting an object, choose
 **Connectors.**
 Sandbox supports Connectors with associated accounts in the primary instance. When mapping your Connector to another instance, you need to have an associated account in the target instance.


**Can I revert to a previous version of a dashboard if necessary?**


 Yes, simply repeat the promotion process, but choose the desired version.


**How long are versions stored and maintained?**

Committed versions are stored indefinitely, but they are only guaranteed to work for one month

*Are users in the Destination instance able to make changes to cards/dashboards promoted to them?**


 Yes, however, any changes they made will be overwritten on a subsequent promotion. If users would like to make changes, they should
 **Save As**
 the card/dashboard to another location and make changes there, as these are independent of the Sandbox Repository.


**Are there unsupported items that will not be promoted?**


 Yes, there is a handful to be aware of:

 Dashboards:
	+ - Poll Cards
		- Dynamic Summary Numbers in Notebook Cards
		- Annotations
		- Certifications
		- Page Ordering


* Dataflows:
	+ - Recursive DataFlows
		- Password-protected DataFlows
		- Writeback Tile DataFlows

*How large can repositories be?**


 There is a limit of 1,000 cards within a repository. In general, there should be a repository for each dashboard or group of DataFlows/Views.


**What happens when a promotion is aborted?**


 The promotion progress is stopped. Any changes that have been made in the process will remain in place and not reverted.


 Troubleshooting
-----------------

Sandbox provides logging on commit and promote activity. The best place to start troubleshooting is to review the commit/promote logs for errors. This will usually provide enough information to fix an issue with a specific object.

###
 Common Areas to Check

*Objects being committed are invalid**

 Cards: Check all Drill Cards for column errors commonly caused by schema changes in the underlying DataSet.
* Beast Modes: Invalid calculations can cause issues commonly caused by schema changes in the underlying DataSet.

*Different Features between source and destination instance**

 Example: If Advanced DataFlow functionality isn’t enabled in the destination, the DataFlows will be inaccessible or won't promote successfully.

*Unsupported items**

 Most objects and functionality are supported through Sandbox, though there are a handful of items to be aware of that aren’t currently supported. See

FAQ

section above for supported objects.
