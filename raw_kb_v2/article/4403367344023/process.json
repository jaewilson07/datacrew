Over time, multiple versions of the selected objects are stored. An example of what might be included is a dashboard (including cards, Beast Modes, images, etc.)\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                            Version\n                           \n\n\n                           A snapshot of a repository at a given point in time. A repository can have multiple versions.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                            Commit\n                           \n\n\n                           The action taken to store a new version. This results in a new snapshot of the Domo objects.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                            Promote\n                           \n\n\n                           The action taken to create or update the objects in the destination Domo instance. An example is promoting a dashboard to production. This creates the dashboard the first time it is promoted or updates the dashboard on subsequent promote actions.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                            Same Instance Promotion\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Promoting a repository in the same instance where it was created. Use this when you want to be able to manage the versioning process in the same Domo instance.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Source Instance\n                           \n\n\n                           The location of the source objects. This is typically a development or sandbox Domo instance.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                            Destination Instance\n                           \n\n\n                           The location where the objects are updated.
