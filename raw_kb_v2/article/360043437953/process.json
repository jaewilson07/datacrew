The plugin pulls all Cards from a page and allocates them according to the template in the currently selected slide. For example, if you select a slide with a four-Card template then choose a Domo page with 32 Cards, those Cards would populate the next eight slides in your presentation, with four Cards appearing per slide as per your template.\n                       \n\n                        You can also insert text macros for swapping in Card text attributes such as title, description, owner name, and so on. When the Cards are pulled in, the real text will replace the macros you have inserted. All macros are prefaced with a @ symbol and are thus easily identified.\n                       \n\n                        You can edit Domo Card layout items just as you can any other elements in PowerPoint. For example, you can add text, move elements around on a slide, and so on.\n                       \n\n                        This section discusses the various options available for setting up Card template layouts.\n                       \n\n                        Specifying the number of Cards in a slide\n                       \n\n                        You can specify whether one, two, or four Cards is added to a template. You do this by clicking\n                        \n                         Single Card\n                        \n                        ,\n                        \n                         Dual Card\n                        \n                        , or\n                        \n                         Four Cards\n                        \n                        , respectively, in the Domo toolbar. If you click one of these options in a blank slide, a visualization layer is added to the slide, divided into the specified number of Card templates. If you click one of these options in a slide that already contains a template, that option replaces the current template. For example, if the slide contains a two-Card template and you click\n                        \n                         Four Cards\n                        \n                        , the four-Card template replaces the two-Card template.\n                       \n\n                        The single-Card and two-Card templates come with preinserted text macros for swapping in text. You can move these, remove them entirely, or add different ones if desired.\n                       \n\n                        The single-Card template includes macros for the Card title, summary number, description, owner name, and last update date, as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The dual-Card template includes macros for the titles, summary numbers, owner names, and last update dates for both Cards, as follows (note that description text macro does not appear by default):\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The four-Card template does\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        include preinserted text macros; however, you can insert these manually using the\n                        \n                         Custom Layout\n                        \n                        options.

This is the macro that pulls in the actual content for a given Card. These macros appear in the following format: @DomoVisualization-\n                        \n                         x\n                        \n                        , where\n                        \n                         x\n                        \n                        is the number corresponding to this visualization on the slide. This is important because all text macros also end with a number,\u00a0which\u00a0matches the number of the corresponding visualization. So, for example, if you had a four-Card template, the visualizations would be numbered 1 through 4. If you then inserted an\n                        \n                         Owner Name\n                        \n                        macro, it would appear as follows:\n                        \n                         @DomoOwnerName-1.\n                        \n                        Then, if you were to pull in Cards for this slide, this macro would be replaced by the name of the owner for\n                        \n                         @DomoVisualization-1\n                         \n                          .\n                         \n\n                        Make sure you match up your text macros with the correct visualizations, or you could end up with Cards paired with the wrong attributes!\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Tip:\n                            \n                            You can quickly add macros with incrementing numbers (\n                           \n\n                            @DomoOwnerName-1,\u00a0@DomoOwnerName-2,\n                           \n                           etc.)\n                           \n                            by\n                           \n\n                            repeatedly clicking the button for that macro.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Removing everything from a slide\n                       \n\n                        You can quickly remove all visualization layers and macros from a slide by clicking\n                        \n                         Clear All\n                        \n                        in the Domo tab.\n                       \n\n                        Pulling Cards into PowerPoint\n                       \n\n                        After you have set up a Card template as described in the previous sections, it is time to pull Domo Cards into PowerPoint based on your template.
