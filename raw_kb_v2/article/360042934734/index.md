A status update in Domo is similar to that found in Facebook. When you enter a status update, you are telling other users in your company what you are working on. You can choose to attach a status update to a particular task in your

Projects & Tasks

page.


 You enter a status update in your personal

Profile

page in the long field at the top of the page.

Status updates appear in Buzz. You can also view a user's log of status updates by going to his or her

Profile

page. Status updates are arranged chronologically from newest to oldest.

*Note:**
 You can change another user's status only if you have sufficient permissions in Domo. For more information about permissions, see

Default Security Role Reference

.

*To enter a status update,**

. Open your

Profile

page by clicking your photo in the top right corner of the screen.
2. Click in the status field at the top of the

Profile

page.
3. Enter your status update in the field.
4. (Optional) To attach this update to a task, click
 **Attach to Task**
 , then select the desired project and task.
5. Press Enter to save your new status update.

You can enter a new status update at any time by deleting the old one from this field and entering the new one.

. Open the user's

Profile

page by doing either of the following:

2. Click the
 **Status Updates**
 tab, which is found in the row of tabs under the user stats.

Profile

page or in his or her
 **Status Updates**
 tab. A count of all of the "likes" a status has received appears next to the status in the
 **Status Updates**
