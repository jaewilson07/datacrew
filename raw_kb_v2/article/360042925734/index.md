You can configure notifications for a Buzz conversation in the Details pane for that conversation. You can configure notification settings for email, Domo Mobile, SMS, and/or pop-up notifications on your computer. For each of these you indicate whether notifications are sent when you are @ mentioned in the conversation, when any activity occurs in the conversation, or not at all.


 In the following example, the user has set computer pop-up notifications

to "All activity" (meaning he will be notified via pop-up notifications when ANY activity occurs in the conversation); Domo Mobile

and email

to "Mentions" (meaning he will be notified via Domo Mobile and email when he is @ mentioned in the conversation); and SMS to "None" (meaning he will not receive ANY notifications for this conversation via SMS).

Conversation notification settings are inherited from your global notification settings you set in the

Configuring Notifications for a Buzz Conversation

screen. So, for example, if you indicated in that screen you did not want to receive any notifications via SMS, by default that setting would persist for this and all other Buzz conversations. But you could make an exception for a given conversation by changing the SMS setting just for that conversation.
