This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Qubole connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Qubole account and create a DataSet, you must have a\u00a0Qubole API token. To find your API token, navigate to\n\nhttps://api.qubole.com/v2/control-panel\n\nand click the\n **My Accounts**\n tab in the left pane. Click\n **Show**\n for the account and copy the API token that is displayed.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Qubole Account\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Qubole Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Qubole account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Qubole\u00a0API Token\n  |\n Enter your Qubole API token. For more information about obtaining an API token, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Select the domain you want to retrieve data from.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Qubole credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Qubole DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Qubole report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Information\n  |\n View the details of the current account.\n  |\n|\n All Commands\n  |\n Returns the \"All Commands\" report containing the query metrics.\n  |\n|\n Bootstrap\n  |\n Return details for a Hive bootstrap in the account.\n  |\n|\n Cluster Metrics\n  |\n Returns metrics for running clusters.\n  |\n|\n Cluster Nodes\n  |\n Returns data about cluster nodes.\n  |\n|\n Cluster Usage\n  |\n Returns cluster usage data.\n  |\n|\n Command Status\n  |\n Returns the status for any command within the last 30 days.\n  |\n|\n Command Status with Results\n  |\n Returns the command status and its results from the last 30 days.\n  |\n|\n Groups with Specific Role\n  |\n Returns a list of groups assigned with a specific role.\n  |\n|\n Hadoop\u00a0Jobs\n  |\n Returns details of the Hadoop jobs spawned on a cluster from the last 30 days.\n  |\n|\n List Actions\n  |\n Returns a list of actions run by the scheduler.\n  |\n|\n List Clusters\n  |\n Returns configuration details of all clusters in the account.\n  |\n|\n List Command Templates\n  |\n Returns a list of command templates.\n  |\n|\n List Data Stores\n  |\n Returns a list of data stores.\n  |\n|\n List Schedule Actions\n  |\n Returns a list of actions run for a scheduler.\n  |\n|\n List Schedules\n  |\n Returns all existing schedules created to run command automatically at a certain frequency within a specified interval.\n  |\n|\n Monthly Usage\n  |\n Returns monthly usage details for an account.\n  |\n|\n Object Policy\n  |\n Returns policies set for an individual object, notebook, or cluster.\n  |\n|\n Pending Users\n  |\n Returns users in an account who are awaiting approval.\n  |\n|\n Qubole Computer Unit Hour\n  |\n Returns\u00a0Qubole Computer Unit Hour (QCUH) details for a specific AWS account.\n  |\n|\n Roles Mapped to Group\n  |\n Returns all roles mapped to a given Qubole group.\n  |\n|\n Table Definition\n  |\n Returns the Hive table definition as well as the AVRO table schema.\n  |\n|\n Table Properties\n  |\n Returns the Hive table properties.\n  |\n|\n Tables in Data Store\n  |\n Returns all tables in a data store.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Returns users for an account.\n  |\n|\n Users in Existing Group\n  |\n Returns all users in a given Qubole group.\n  |\n|\n View Command History\n  |\n Returns the command history.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Command ID\n  |\n Select the command you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Cluster ID\n  |\n Select the cluster you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Schedule ID\n  |\n Select the schedule you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Commands for All Users?\n  |\n Select\n **Yes**\n if you want your report to show commands for all users.
