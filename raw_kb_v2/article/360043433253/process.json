This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Domo JSON connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Domo JSON account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The Domo URL you want to retrieve information from\n* The username and password for the specified Domo instance\n\nConnecting to Your Domo JSON Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Domo JSON Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo JSON account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a single field in which you enter your Domo URL.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n URL\n  |\n Enter the URL of the Domo instance you want to pull information from.
