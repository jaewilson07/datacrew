Once you have created a Clicktale DataSet, you can use Beast Mode to add Replay links to your Clicktale cards. This article explains how to perform both of these tasks.\n                       \n\n                        Prerequisites\n                       \n\n                        To pull Clicktale data into Domo, you will need SFTP credentials (which should be provided to you by Clicktale).
