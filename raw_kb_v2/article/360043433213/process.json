Domo's CloudHealth connector allows you to retrieve data through prebuilt or\u00a0customized reports. To learn more about the\u00a0CloudHealth API, visit their\u00a0GitHub API site\u00a0(\n\nhttps://github.com/CloudHealth/cht\\_api\\_guide\n\n).\n\nBen Green\n\nSep 29, 2016, 9:31 AM\n\nThe Cloud Health connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to\u00a0the CloudHealth API\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0CloudHealth connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to the CloudHealth API and create a DataSet, you must have a CloudHealth API key.\n\n*To obtain an API key,**\n\n. Log into CloudHealth using your username and password.\n2. Click\n **My Profile**\n .\n3. In the\n **API Key**\n section, click\n **Generate API Key**\n .\n\n\n Connecting to the CloudHealth API\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0CloudHealth connector\u00a0page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n In this pane, you connect to CloudHealth by entering your CloudHealth API key in the\n **API Key**\n field. For information about obtaining an API key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have connected to CloudHealth, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0CloudHealth DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains\u00a0a primary\u00a0menu,\n **Report**\n , along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nReport Type\n\n|\n\nSelect a custom report or the predefined\n **Cost**\n report.\n\n|\n|\n Cost Type\n  |\n\nSelect the cost type for your\n **Cost**\n report.\n\n\n Cost\u00a0types are as follows:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nCost History\n\n|\n\nRetrieves the cost history for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nProjected Cost\n\n|\n\nRetrieves projected costs for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nCost History and Projected Cost\n\n|\n\nRetrieves cost history and projected costs for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nPossible Optimization Cost\n\n|\n\nRetrieves possible optimization costs for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nSavings Cost\n\n|\n\nReturns savings costs for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nOpportunities Savings Cost\n\n|\n\nReturns opportunities savings costs for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nOperational Monthly Saving\n\n|\n\nReturns operational monthly savings for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nSecurity Saving\n\n|\n\nReturns security savings for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n|\n\nImmediate Saving\n\n|\n\nReturns immediate savings for the given interval and category.\n\n|\n\n\n |\n|\n\nReport Interval\n\n|\n\nSelect the interval for your report, either daily, weekly, or monthly.\n\n|\n|\n\nReport Category\n\n|\n\nSelect a category for your report.\n\n|\n|\n\nCustom Report\n\n|\n\nSelect a CloudHealth custom report.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433213\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003593\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCloudHealth Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,653\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "cloudhealth_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
