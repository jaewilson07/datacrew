Because of this you must apply PDP policies to the output DataSets generated by a DataFlow.\n\n\n When you build a DataFlow using an input DataSet\u00a0with PDP\u00a0policies in place,\u00a0the DataFlow breaks unless\u00a0at least one of the following criteria\u00a0applies:\n\n You have an \"Admin\" security profile or a custom role with \"Manage DataFlows\" enabled.\n* You are\u00a0the DataSet owner.\n* You are\u00a0part of the \"All Rows\" policy. This gives you access to all of the rows in the DataSet.\n\nIf a DataFlow breaks as a result of PDP\u00a0policies being applied to\u00a0input DataSets, you can fix it by adding the owner\u00a0to the \"All Rows\" policy as follows:\n\n. Open the\n **Personalized Data Permissions**\n tab for the PDP-affected DataSet.\n2. Click\n **Impact**\n .\n\n\n This opens the\n **PDP Outcomes for this DataSet**\n dialog, which lists all of the items in Domo that have been impacted as a result of PDP policies.\u00a0For more information, see\n\nCreating and Deleting PDP Policies\n\n.\n3. Click\n **Attention**\n .\n4. In the list, locate the DataFlow you want to fix.\n5. Click\n **Fix It**\n .\n\nThis adds the DataFlow owner to the \"All Rows\" policy for this DataSet. The DataFlow\u00a0can now be run as normal.\n\n\n PDP with DataFusions\n----------------------\n\nPDP can be applied to both input and output DataFusion DataSets.\n\n\n If you are creating a DataFusion\u00a0that includes one or more DataSets with PDP enabled, you must have \"all rows\" access for those DataSets.\n\n\n If the owner of a DataFusion loses access to one or more PDP-enabled\u00a0input DataSets, the DataFusion will be disabled.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043439333\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004909\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPDP and DataFlows/DataFusions\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,507\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:35 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "pdp_and_dataflowsdatafusions", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "working_with_datasets_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan2GAC"}, {"text": "personalized_data_permissions_pdp", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zao2GAC"}]}
