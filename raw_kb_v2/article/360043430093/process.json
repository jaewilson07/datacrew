For example, to stylize a cell in the `Salesperson` column when the cell value equals `Bob`, create a calculation named `Salesperson`, and then use the following code:\n                       \nCASE `salesperson`\n\nwhen 'Bob' then CONCAT('<span style=\"color:red\">',`salesperson`,'</span>')\n\nelse `salesperson`\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n                        Including\u00a0a URL in a Table Card\n                       \n\n                        Use\u00a0the following Beast Mode calculation to insert a URL into a Table Card:\n                       \nCONCAT(`TopicName`, ': ', '<a href=\"', `Link`, '\" target=\"_blank\">', `Link`, '</a>')\n\n\n                        \"TopicName\" refers to the field in the DataSet with your topic names, and \"Link\" refers to the field with the URLs.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Important:\n                           \n                           URLs\u00a0must begin with\n                           \n                            https://\n                           \n                           .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Formatting a Summary Number\n                       \n\n                        You can use a Beast Mode calculation to change the font size for a Summary Number, customize other aspects of a Summary Number's appearance, and even include multiple Summary Numbers in the same card.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Important:\n                           \n                           The changes discussed in this section are\u00a0not\u00a0supported on Domo\u00a0Mobile or when exporting to PowerPoint.
