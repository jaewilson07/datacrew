You can use the Domo\u00a0Twilio\u00a0Advanced connector to retrieve data on accounts, calls, conferences, notifications, SMS messages, and usage records.\u00a0For more information about the\u00a0Twilio API, go to\n\nhttps://www.twilio.com/docs/api\n\n.\n\n\n The Twilio\u00a0Advanced connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This advanced version of the Twilio connector differs from the standard version in that it lets you retrieve data for a selected date or date range, whereas the standard version does not. For more information about the standard version, see\n\nTwilio Connector\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Twilio\u00a0Advanced connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is used for compiling reports about Twilio calls, conferences, notifications, etc.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Call Traffic\n* SMS Traffic\n* Cost Trend\n* Call completion rate\n* Average call duration\n* Call cost\n* SMS cost\n* Abandon rate\n* Daily call volume\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Product owner\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n ~1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nOne account can own only 1000 subaccounts by default. For more, you must mail Twilio at\n\nhelp@twilio.com\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Twilio account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A Twilio account SID.\n* A Twilio auth token.\n\nYou can find both of these items in your Twilio account settings page, in the\n **API Credentials**\n section. For more information, see\n\nhttp://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-the-auth-token-and-how-can-i-change-it\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Twilio Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Twilio\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Twilio\u00a0account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account SID\n  |\n Enter your Twilio account SID.\n  |\n|\n Auth Token\n  |\n Enter your Twilio auth token.\n  |\n\nAfter you have entered valid\u00a0Twilio credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Twilio DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu in which you select a report type, as well as other fields and menus that appear, depending on the selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n |\n Select a Twilio report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Accounts\n  |\n Returns information about\u00a0the authenticated user's accounts, including SID, name, type, status, auth token, etc.\n  |\n|\n Alerts\n  |\n Returns a list of alerts generated for the authenticated user's account.\n  |\n|\n Calls\n  |\n Returns information about calls, including phone number, call status, inbound or outbound, call start and end time, etc.\n  |\n|\n Conferences\n  |\n Returns information about conferences, including SID, name, status, created and updated dates, etc.\n  |\n|\n Notifications\n  |\n Returns information about notifications, including SID, message text, message date, etc.\n  |\n|\n SMS Messages\n  |\n Returns information about SMS messages, including SID, body text, status, price, date sent, etc.\n  |\n|\n Usage Records\n  |\n Returns information about usage records, including category,\u00a0SID, start and end date, price, description, etc.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Account Name (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0name of the account you want to pull alerts data for.\u00a0If you do not enter an account name, data is pulled for all accounts.\n  |\n|\n To Number (Optional)\n  |\n Enter a telephone number to\u00a0filter your report\u00a0to show\u00a0placed calls\u00a0or SMS messages from that number.\n  |\n|\n From Number (Optional)\n  |\n Enter a telephone number to\u00a0filter your report to show\u00a0received calls or SMS messages from that number.\n  |\n|\n Status\n  |\n Select a\u00a0call status to\u00a0filter your report to show items with that status.\n  |\n|\n Log\n  |\n Select a log to filter your report to show items from that log.\n  |\n|\n Log Level\n  |\n Select the log level you want to filter your report by.\n  |\n|\n Category\n  |\n Select a category to break down the usage records by.\n  |\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nTwilio may limit API calls. To prevent rate limiting, reduce the number of DataSets scheduled to run at the same time.\n\n####\n Can I use the same Twilio account for multiple DataSets?\n\nYes.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Double-check your credentials.\n* Log into Twilio and check the dashboard for data.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043435233\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003399\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nTwilio Advanced Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 3,701\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "twilio_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
