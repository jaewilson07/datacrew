This is the part of your login URL before\n\n\n domo.com\n\n\n . For example, if your Domo login URL was\n\n\n https://modocorp.domo.com\n\n\n , the customer instance name would be\n\nmodocorp\n\n.\n* A Domo Access Token, denoted as\n\ndomo\\_access\\_token\n\nin this documentation. This is required to access your Domo instance via the Domo API. A user at your company with an \"Admin\" security role (or a custom role with \"Manage All Company Settings\" or \"Manage All Access Tokens\" enabled) will need to generate this token by going to\n **Admin > Security > Access Tokens**\n in your account and clicking\n **Generate Access Token**\n in the upper right corner.\n\n*Note:**\n T\n\nhe R SDK requires httr 1.0.0 or lower and readr 0.2.0 or lower installed in your instance of R.\n\nInstalling R\n--------------\n\nInformation on Installing the R SDK can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/domoinc/rdomo\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042923734\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004588\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nInstalling the R SDK\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,252\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "installing_the_r_sdk", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "transforming_data_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamzGAC"}, {"text": "sdks", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zao8GAC"}]}
