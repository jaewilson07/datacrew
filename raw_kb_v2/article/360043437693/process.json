It is available as 32-bit and 64-bit installer packages for Microsoft Windows. Bitness is decided by the application you are using. 64-bit Windows can run 32-bit as well as 64-bit applications. If your application (the application using Domo ODBC Data Driver) is 32-bit, install a 32-bit driver. This document describes the steps involved in setting up Domo ODBC Data Driver on your machine.\n                       \n\n                        Domo ODBC Data Driver fetches data from Domo over HTTPS. The query execution time depends on the size of data and the data speed of your network.\n                       \n\n                        Domo ODBC Data Driver requires a Client ID and Client Secret for authentication, and it supports simple queries as described later in this document.\n                       \n\n                        To obtain Domo ODBC Data Driver, go to\n                        \n                         Admin\n                        \n                        >\n                        \n                         Tool Downloads\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        To purchase the ODBC Data Driver, reach out to your Account Executive (AE).\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           The ODBC Driver fetches up to 1 million rows.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Connection Strings\n                       \n\n                        ODBC drivers follow this\u00a0format for the connection string:\n                       \n\n\n                         Driver={<Driver Name>};<additional parameters like username, password>\n                        \n\n\n                        This is the format of additional parameters (key-value pairs separated by semicolon):\n                       \n\n\n                         param1=value1;param2=value2;\n                        \n\n\n                        The Domo ODBC Data Driver follows the same format. A Client ID and Client Secret are required for authentication and must be included in the connection string. A sample connection string for the Domo ODBC Data Driver looks like this:\n                       \n\n\n                         Driver={Domo ODBC Data Driver};ClientID=1234-abcd-5678-efgh;ClientSecret=abcdefgh123456;\n                        \n\n\n                        You can also create connection strings by specifying the DSN (Data Source Name). In the Domo ODBC Data Driver, the DSN stores the Client ID and Client Secret, and the connection string becomes simpler:\n                       \n\n\n                         DSN=DomoDataDSII;\n                        \n\n\n                        DomoDataDSII is the default DSN created during the installation of the Domo ODBC Data Driver. You need to configure the DNS (DomoDataDSII) before using it in any connection string. Configuration is done in the\n                        \n                         ODBC Data Sources\n                        \n                        tool of Windows. You need a valid ClientID and ClientSecret to configure the DSN.\n                        \n                        Syntax of the connection string might change according to the application, as some applications add\n                        \n                         Driver={ and DSN=\n                        \n                        to the provided inputs by default.\n                       \n\n                        Query Syntax\n                       \n\n                        Domo ODBC Data Driver supports standard SQL-type statements in the format\n                        \n                         SELECT <column names, or *> FROM <dataset id> WHERE <clause> \u2026\n                        \n                        etc.\u00a0For example:\n                        \n\n\n                         SELECT * FROM 6f3def59-4a7b-4c25-99db-5e1b44501afd\n                        \n\n\n                        Or\n                        \n\n\n                         SELECT name, temperature, temperatureUnit, shortForecast FROM 3a2153e4-4b78-4319-9b47-84fb148afd22 WHERE name IN ('Today', 'Tonight', 'This Afternoon')\n                        \n\n\n                        Creating Client ID and Secret\n                       \n\n                        A ClientID and ClientSecret are required parameters for ODBC connection with Domo ODBC Data Driver.\n                       \n\n\n                         To obtain a Client ID and Client Secret for your account,\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Login to\n                          \n                           https://developer.domo.com\n                          \n                          and go to\n                          \n                           My Account > Manage Clients.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          (Conditional) If you don\u2019t have a client, create a new one for the ODBC driver by doing the following:\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Click\n                            \n                             Create a Client\n                            \n                            .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Enter the name and description.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Select application scopes.
