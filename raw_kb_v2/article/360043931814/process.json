After that, they began to be staggered, such that the Summer and Winter games alternate on a four-year cycle. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           OLYMPICS_athlete_events.csv\n                          \n                          (34.5 MB)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           OLYMPICS_athlete_events.xlsx\n                          \n                          (20.7 MB)\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Columns in this dataset are as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Column\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Description\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            ID\n                           \n\n\n\n                            An ID number assigned to this athlete based on their sequential order in the dataset\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Name\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The name of the athlete\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Sex\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The gender of the athlete\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Age\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The age of the athlete\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Height\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The height of the athlete, in centimeters\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Weight\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The weight of the athlete, in kilograms\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Team\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The country this athlete represents\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            NOC\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The three-letter abbreviation for the country represented by the athlete\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Games\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The year and season for this Olympic event\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Year\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The year of the event\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Season\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The season of the event (either Summer or Winter)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            City\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The city in which these Olympics was held\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Sport\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The sport of the event\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Event\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The name of the event\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Medal\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The medal won by the athlete (\"NA\" if no medal was won)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Superhero Characteristics\u00a0and Powers\n                       \n\n                        These datasets include basic information for over 700 superheroes (and villains).

For example, the superhero \"Banshee\" is assigned a value of \"TRUE\" for \"Flight,\" \"Audio Control,\" \"Force Field,\" \"Enhanced Hearing,\" \"Sonar,\" and \"Sonic Scream,\" and \"FALSE\" for all other powers.\n                       \n\n                        UFO Sightings\n                       \n\n                        These\u00a0datasets include\u00a0information on all reported UFO sightings from 1906 to 2014, with time standardization and geocoding. Two datasets in CSV format are linked here. The first of these, UFO_sightings_complete.csv,\u00a0includes entries where the location of the sighting was not found or blank (0.8146%) or have an erroneous or blank time (8.0237%).

The first dataset, NationalNames.csv, provides counts of all names throughout the U.S. as a whole, while the second, StateNames.csv, breaks these counts down by individual state (therefore it is significantly larger).
