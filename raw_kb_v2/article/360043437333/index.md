You can configure Workbench to allow users to be notified via


 email when a DataSet job is completed, either successfully or unsuccessfully. You do this in the
 **Notifications**
 subtab for a given DataSet job. This lists all of the users on your Domo server with their roles and the email addresses to which notifications will be sent. For each user,
 **Notify on Success**
 and
 **Notify on Error**
 boxes are available. For any given user, you can select one box, both boxes, or leave both blank (in which case no notifications are sent).

*To set notifications for a Workbench job,**

. Click the

icon in the left-hand icon bar.
2. Open the job you want to set notifications for.
3. Click
 **Notifications**
 .
4. Locate the user in the list you want to set notifications for.
5. Check the desired box(es).
6. Click "X" to close the dialog.
