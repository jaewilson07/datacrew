Vertica partitioning allows you to break up data in a way that improves performance. Partitions in Vertica can improve parallelism during query execution.\u00a0Use Domo's Vertica Partition Connector to get your data into Domo\u00a0for in-depth analysis and visualization, based on the number of past days provided. To learn more about Vertica, visit\n\nhttps://my.vertica.com/documentation/vertica/\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Vertica account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Vertica\u00a0Partition connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Vertica account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The name of the host or server where the Vertica\u00a0database is hosted\n* The username and password you use to connect to the Vertica database\n* The Vertica database port number\n* The name of the Vertica\u00a0database\n\nConnecting to Your Vertica Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nVertica\u00a0Partition\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nVertica\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the name of the server where the Vertica\u00a0database is hosted.\n  |\n|\n Port Number\n  |\n Enter the port number of the Vertica database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to connect to the Vertica database.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to connect to the Vertica database.\n  |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the Vertica database.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\n\nVertica\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nVertica Partition\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Whitelisting\n\nBefore you can connect to a\u00a0Vertica database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you input the SQL query you want to use to pull data from your Vertica database.\u00a0You can choose a specific database table and\u00a0partition column name. You can also specify the number of past days you want to get data for.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SQL query to execute.\n  |\n|\n Table Name\n  |\n Select the database table.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column Name\n  |\n Select the partition column name.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that you want to get data for. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. Example: 30.\n  |\n|\n Date Format\n  |\n Select the required date format. By default\n ********************************yyyy-MM-dd********************************\n will be used.\n  |\n|\n Custom Date Format\n  |\n Enter the custom date format you wish to apply to your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360057014014\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003965\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nVertica Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,671\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "vertica_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
