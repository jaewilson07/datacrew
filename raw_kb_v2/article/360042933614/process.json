You can download and install both apps from the Domo Appstore.\n                       \n\n                        Form Viewer can exist on one or more Domo dashboards. The response data from Form Viewer is stored in App DB, and then synced to the Domo Data Center. Typically, you must then transform the data in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        This article details\u00a0the configuration process for the Form Viewer app. If you are creating multiple instances of Form Viewer, we strongly recommend that you complete the configuration process once, for a single instance of Form Viewer, and then choose\n                        \n                         Save As\n                        \n                        to create another app card so that you do not have to go through the configuration process again.\n                       \n\n                        After creating and configuring a form, you can make it available in your Domo instance or use public embed to make it available for non-Domo users. For more information about public embed, see the\n                        \n                         Public Embed\n                        \n                        heading later in this article and our article on\n                        \n                         Sharing Content Outside of Domo with Embed\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Each user can only interact with one form in an instance of Form Viewer, but you can make multiple submissions to that form and return to edit submissions anytime unless the form is deleted, depending on the configuration in the\n                        \n                         Form Builder App\n                        \n                        .
