In the

Profile

page, you can upload any personal photos you want others in your organization to be able to see. Photos in your personal photo store are different from

profile pictures

in that they do
 *not*
 represent you throughout Domo as profile pictures do. Personal photos help to tell others about yourself and are found only in your

Profile

page.

You can upload as many personal photos to Domo as you want. When you select a photo for uploading, Domo gives you options to crop and rotate it before you upload it. You can click a photo to show it in a larger view, as well as "like" a photo by clicking on its "thumbs up" icon. You can also delete any photo you've uploaded.

*Note:**
 You can manage other users' personal photos
 *only*
 if you have sufficient permissions in Domo. For more information about permissions, see

Default Security Role Reference

.
