Intro

Aloha POS  is a cloud-based retail solution for restaurants; it can be used to enter orders and payments, improve overall operations and streamline the preparation of food and delivery. This connector uses RealTime APIs—data streams that can be used to deliver actionable information in real time such as to a user's smartphone or an analytic engine. Data includes sales by key metrics, transaction level detail, returns, voids, average items per transaction, labor by shift, labor by overtime and much more.
