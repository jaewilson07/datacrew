They allow you to use and arrange any columns from your DataSets in any way you like. For more information about building tables, see our article about\n                        \n                         Table Charts\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        While tables are reliable,\u00a0they don't always provide quick insights. The first example below shows a rather plain table, while the second example shows a more informational table that includes links, colors, and images.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           When adding graphics, links, and images to Table Cards using Beast Mode, remember the following:\n                           \n\n                             Mega Tables do not support HTML tags or style attributes in HTML; they support only images and links.\n                            \n\n                             HTML Tables support HTML tags and style attributes, such as style=\"background-color\".\n                            \n\n                             HTML Tables do not support filtering when content is added to cells using a Beast Mode calculation.\u00a0For more information, see our article about\n                             \n                              Applying Page-Level Filters with Filter Views\n                             \n                             .\n                             \n\n\n\n\n                             Cards cannot be embedded within cells of Table Cards because iFrames are not supported.

All you need to know is some HTML and how to use the concat() function in Beast Mode.\n                       \n\n                        To add links or anchor tags to a table, follow these steps:\n                       \n\n\n                         In the upper-right corner of a card, select\n                         \n\n                          Settings\n                         \n                         >\n                         \n                          Edit in Analyzer\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         Select\n                         \n                          Beast Mode\n                         \n                         from the toolbar at the top of Analyzer.\n                        \n\n                         Enter the name of your Beast Mode formula in the\n                         \n                          Calculated Field Name\n                         \n                         field.\n                        \n\n                         Use the concat() function to create an HTML string for your table link or anchor. Here is a sample link to a JIRA source system:\n                         CONCAT('<div><a href=\"https://onjira.domo.com/browse.com\"','\"target=\"_blank\">';,`Sales Rep`,'</a></div>')\n\n\n                         Replace\n                         \n\n\n                            https://onjira.domo.com/browse.com\n                           \n\n\n                         with your link.\n                        \n\n                         Replace\n                         \n                          `Sales Rep`\n                         \n                         with the text you want your link to display in the table.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n\n\n                               \"target=_blank\"\u00a0forces the link to open in a new tab in your browser.
