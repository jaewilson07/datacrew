A broad and inclusive approach with all LOBs is required, and all valuable data is not yet controlled by IT.\n* **Increased stress and time constraints \u2014**\n Business users demand timely access to data products, increasing the pressure to deliver.\n* **Rigidity and friction in data processes \u2014**\n Rigid processes and tooling prevent the building of databases in a speedy and flexible manner, requiring too much time effort.\n\nCloud Amplifier can provide solutions for\n\n\n these issues and more.\n\n\n This article provides information about configuring Cloud Amplifier for your Domo environment in the following topics:\n\n Required grants\n* Setup\n* Best practices\n* Federated data vs. Cloud Amplifier\n* Technical FAQ\n\nRequired Grants\n-------------------\n\nAfter Cloud Amplifier is enabled for your Domo environment, you can assign the following Cloud Amplifier grants to manage access to these features:\n\n **Manage Cloud Accounts**\n \u2014 Allows a user to\u00a0add/remove cloud accounts\u00a0and add/remove tables from a cloud account. This grant also allows a user\u00a0to change the default storage cloud.\n\n*Note:**\n This grant must be assigned to a user with the Manage DataSet grant to work properly.\n* **Override Default Cloud**\n \u2014 Allows a user\u00a0to\u00a0use any storage cloud account that is shared with them instead of the default cloud.\u00a0If you do not have this grant, you can't use any other cloud besides the default cloud.\n\n*Note:**\n This grant must be assigned to a user with the Edit DataSet or Manage DataSet grant to work properly.\n\nSetup\n---------\n\nTo enable Cloud Amplifier, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Executive (AE). You can then connect your existing data warehouses from the providers listed below. Each provider has their own unique requirements, and you can follow the links below to see the documentation for each provider and their requirements.\n\n\n Available providers include:\n\n Snowflake\n* Dremio\n\n\n Support for the following providers is in beta as of March 2023. To join the beta for one of these providers, contact your CSM or AE.\n * BigQuery (Read only)\n* Databricks\u00a0(Read only)\n* Redshift\u00a0(Read only)\n\n\n####\n Defaults\n\nCloud Amplifier allows you to specify a default storage account for all DataSets. Changing these settings does not change existing DataSets or DataFlows. These defaults are only used for new assets.\n\nBack to top\n\nBest Practices\n------------------\n\nWe recommend\u00a0you choose a default storage cloud. To do this, follow the steps below:\n\n. In\u00a0the Domo navigation header, go to\n **More**\n >\n **Admin**\n .\n2. Under\n **Features**\n , select\n **Cloud Amplifier**\n .\n3. On the\n **Cloud Amplifier**\n page, select an option from the\n **Select the default storage cloud**\n list.\n\n\n We recommend that you set up your Cloud Amplifier connections using a service account.\n\n\n If you need to move a DataSet from one warehouse to another, you can use Magic ETL to copy a specific DataSet hosted in your database\u00a0and materialize it in Domo, where it runs\u00a0on a schedule.\n\n\n Back to top\n\nFederated Data vs. Cloud Amplifier\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe table below compares federated data to Cloud Amplifier read and read/write configurations:\n\n\n Capability\n  |\n Federated-Direct Query\n  |\n Cloud Amplifier Integration (Read-Adapter)\n  |\n Cloud Amplifier Integration (Read/Write Adapter)\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Visualize data from existing tables\n\n- Create cards\n\n- Create dashboards\n  |\n\n|  |  |\n|\n Visualize on-premise data behind firewall via an agent\n  |\n\n|\n\n|  |\n|\n Get updated metadata from source tables\n\n- Last updated time\n\n- Updated row count\n  |\n\n|\n\n(\n **Every 15 minutes\n\nConfigurable**\n )\n\n|\n\n\n (\n **Every 15 minutes\n\nConfigurable**\n )\n  |\n|\n Card Alerts\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n (\n **Every 15 minutes\n\nConfigurable**\n )\n  |\n\n\n (\n **Every 15 minutes\n\nConfigurable**\n )\n  |\n|\n DataSet Alerts\n  |  |\n\n\n (\n **Every 15 minutes\n\nConfigurable**\n )\n  |\n\n\n (\n **Every 15 minutes\n\nConfigurable**\n )\n  |\n|\n DataSet Views\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Use data from existing tables in Magic ETL as inputs\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Use data updates from existing tables to trigger other DataFlows\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Custom fiscal calendar for source table data (one per instance)\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Use Domo Connectors, Workbench, SDK, CLI to write to customer-owned EDW/Data Lake\n  |  |  |\n\n*Native direct rewrite**\n |\n|\n Write Magic ETL output to customer-owned EDW/Data Lake\n  |  |  |\n\n*Native direct rewrite**\n |\n|\n PDP | Governance\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Domo\u00a0App Support\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Jupyter Workspace Support\n  |  |  |  |\n|\n Domo auto-caching of card loads\n  |\n\n*Set static TTL on each DataSet**\n |  |  |\n\n\n Back to top\n----------------\n\n\n Technical FAQ\n------------------\n\n\n###\n General\n\n*How do Cloud Amplifier DataSets impact DataFlows scheduled to run when a DataSet refreshes?**\n\n\n Cloud Amplifier DataSets operate the same as Domo DataSets. Additionally, Magic ETL can\u00a0trigger\u00a0the ETL to run when the data is updated in your database.\n\n\n By default,\u00a0Domo polls the database\u00a0metadata every 15 minutes to check for updates.\n\n\n**Is the 15-minute interval at which Domo checks for updates configurable?**\n\n\n Yes,\n\nDomo Support\n\ncan\u00a0adjust the window\u00a0down to one minute on the back end.\n\n\n**How are Cloud Amplifier\u00a0DataSets supported as inputs?**\n\n\n Magic ETL v2 supports Cloud Amplifier DataSets.\n\n\n**Can I use\u00a0Cloud Amplifier if I also use Domo Everywhere?**\n\n\n Yes, you can. You can designate DataSets created via Cloud Amplifier\u00a0as published DataSets in order to create a virtualized DataSet in a subscriber organization. You can then use the virtualized subscriber DataSeta\u00a0as an input to Magic ETL transformations and\u00a0configure it for\u00a0DataSet Alerts.\n\n\n You can also use DataSets created via Cloud Amplifier with\n\nDomo Everywhere Embed\n\n.\n\n\n**Does Cloud Amplifier work with Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)?**\n\n\n Not at this time.\n\n##\n External Cloud Storage\n\n\n**Can I create DataSet Views or DataFusions that are materialized and then stored in an external cloud (outside of Domo)?**\n\nNot at this time.\n\n*Can I use Domo to define a view and have it create a view in my database?**\n\nNot at this time.\n\n\n**Does Domo cache data on DataSets that are stored in an external cloud?**\n\n\n Data can be cached for up to 24 hours, but the cache is cleared when data updates. For customer-managed DataSets, there may be up to a 15-minute delay between when the data updates and the cache is cleared.\n\n\n**Does Cloud Amplifier use my cloud warehouse account?**\n\n\n Yes, Domo operates on\u00a0your\u00a0cloud warehouse account.\n\n\n**How does Domo access my cloud warehouse account?**\n\n\n Domo's method of accessing a\u00a0cloud warehouse account depends on the warehouse. We recommend using a system account, rather than individual user accounts, to grant Domo access to all cloud warehouses. See the\n\nindividual provider guides\n\nlisted above to learn how that Domo accesses that particular provider.\n\n\n**Does Domo support OAUTH for Cloud Amplifier?**\n\n\n Not at this time.\n\n\n**Can I use both \"traditional\" Domo and Cloud Amplifier in parallel?**\n\n\n Yes. By default, you have access to both Domo's proprietary Adrenaline engine and the\u00a0Cloud Amplifier engine. You can configure your Domo environment so that only the Cloud Amplifier DataSets are allowed to run in your Domo environment, but\n\nDomo Support\n\nneeds to help with this.\n\n\n**Can I move existing DataSets from Domo to my cloud provider using Cloud Amplifier?**\n\n\n For existing DataSets created via a connector or Domo APIs, you can reach out to\n\nDomo Support\n\nfor assistance to move them to your cloud provider. If those DataSets were created via some other method, you would need to recreate those in your cloud provider manually.\n\n\n**Does Cloud Amplifier work with Domo's DataSet APIs?**\n\n\n Domo's APIs can be used with any DataSet in a Domo-managed database, as long as that table is in the Domo-managed database that was configured during the\u00a0write integration step of your Cloud Amplifier setup. Customer-managed databases that exist in\u00a0the cloud,\n\nfrom\n\nwhich Domo can read but\n\ncan\n\nnot write to, cannot be updated with Domo APIs.\n\n\n This includes, but is\n\n\n not limited to, the streams API, webhooks, custom apps that generate new data such as Form Builder,\u00a0and managing a DataSet via the DataSet API (such as updating a DataSet, managing personalized data permissions (PDP) policies, changing the owner of a DataSet, exporting a DataSet).\n\n\n For a more comprehensive guide to using the DataSets API, see our\n\ndeveloper docs\n\n.\n\nBack to top\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4412849158167\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003147\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCloud Amplifier Overview\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,487\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:09 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "cloud_amplifier_overview", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "cloud_amplifier", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zjd3GAC"}]}
