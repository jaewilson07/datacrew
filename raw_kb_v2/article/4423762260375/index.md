Intro
-------

Domo Bricks (formerly DDX Bricks) are pre-built objects that allow you to create advanced visualizations and apps that can be customized by simply copying and pasting code.


 With Domo Bricks, business users, citizen developers, and full-stack developers can quickly iterate, prototype, and compose new apps with beautiful and advanced features. You can choose from Bricks available in the Domo Appstore. You can also use Domo Bricks to render a new library you found online by copying and pasting.


 Domo Bricks let you use HTML, CSS, and JS to completely customize your app. These new custom solutions visuals are immediately rendered and can be easily updated all within your Domo instance.


 You can find Domo Bricks in the Appstore.
