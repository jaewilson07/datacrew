 You can review your license seat usage and order licenses in


 Domo. The
 **More >**
**Admin > Governance > Licenses**
 sub-tab shows the number of paid versus courtesy (unpaid) licenses in your Domo instance as well as the number of Social users. In this tab you can buy new licenses, pay for courtesy licenses, approve or deny upgrade requests, and upgrade Social users to paid Domo users.


 You can only view and manage user licenses if you have an "Admin" default security role or a custom role with "Manage All Company Settings" enabled.
