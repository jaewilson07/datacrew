For example, you\u00a0might\u00a0have a column containing\u00a0values with one or more decimal places.\u00a0You could create a new column in which\u00a0all of the values in the original column are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number,\u00a0using the\n\nCEILING\n\nor\n\nFLOOR\n\nfunctions, respectively. Workbench 5 contains over 80 such functions you can use in constructing calculations. Categories of functions include logical (such as\n\nAND\n\n,\n\nNOT\n\n,\n\nIF\n\n, etc.), mathematical (such as\n\nACOS\n\n,\n\nRND\n\n, and\n\nSUMLIST\n\n), statistical (such as\n\nAVERAGE\n\n,\n\nMAX\n\n, and\n\nSTDEV\n\n), text (such as\n\nCONCATENATE\n\n,\n\nMID\n\n, and\n\nSUBSTITUTE\n\n), and date and time (such as\n\nDAY\n\n,\n\nEOMONTH\n\n, and\n\nTODAY\n\n). You can find descriptions of all of the functions in the Workbench 4 user interface.\n\n\n You build calculated fields for a selected DataSet job in the\n **Calculated\u00a0Field Transform Editor.**\n You access the\n **Calculated\u00a0Field Transform Editor**\n for a DataSet by adding a\n **Calculation**\n transform.\n\n*Video - Calculated Field Transform in Workbench 5**\n\n*To add a calculated field in Workbench 5,**\n\n. In Workbench, click\n\nin the left-hand icon bar.\n2. In the Jobs listing, double-click\u00a0the job for which you want to create a calculated column.\n3. Click\n **Transforms**\n to expand that section of the pane.\n4. In the\n **Add a transform**\n menu, select\n **Calculated Field Transform**\n .\n5. Click the\n\nbutton.\n\n\n The\n **Calculated Field Transform Editor**\n appears.\n6. Enter a name for the new column in the\n **Column Name**\n field.\n7. Build your calculation in the\n **Calculation**\n field using the column names in the\n **Available columns**\n listing and the functions in the\n **Available**\n**functions**\n listing.\n\n\n You can add column names and functions to a calculation by double-clicking them in the list.\n\n\n You can filter the functions by category by selecting the desired category in\u00a0the\n **Category**\n menu. All functions\u00a0are accompanied by descriptions; you can see\u00a0the description for a function by clicking that function. In addition, each function shows its proper usage. For example, the\n\nSUM\n\nfunction is represented as\n\nSUM (p1, [p2],...).\n\nThis means that you\u00a0are summing the values in all referenced columns, which are indicated by\n\np1\n\n,\n\np2\n\n, and so on.\n8. Click\n **Validate**\n to ensure that\u00a0your calculation is valid.\n\n*Note:**\n In calculations, column names\n *cannot*\n contain non-ASCII characters. You can reference a column in a calculation using\n\nColumn#\n\nwhere\n\n#\n\nis the 1-based column order. For example:\n\nCONCATENATE(Column2,Column3)\n9. Click\n **Apply**\n when finished.\n10. Click\n\nat the top of the pane to save your transform.\n\nThe next time you run the job, the newly calculated column will be added to your DataSet.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932794\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004833\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCreating Columns in Workbench 5 Using Calculations\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,858\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:31 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "creating_columns_in_workbench_5_using_calculations", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_5", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapTGAS"}]}
