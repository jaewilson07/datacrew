In addition to guiding you through longstanding alert-building processes such as configuring alert rules and sharing alerts, the Wizard\u00a0also includes a Custom Message Builder. This new tool allows you to\u00a0customize the message that is sent when an alert is triggered. Instead of having to read a system-generated message that may not always make sense to recipients, you can\u00a0now configure your own templates on a per-alert basis.\n\n\n When you go\u00a0to set up a new alert, you can write your\u00a0own text and incorporate system variables to produce a more human-readable, friendly, and informative alert message, which can provide more context to recipients faster. The result is dynamically-generated messages sent to alert recipients\u00a0that clearly provide information on what the alert is supposed to tell them about, as well as what has triggered the alert.\n\n\n Managing by exception and keeping everyone on the same page at the same time just got one notch easier.\n\nFor more information about creating alerts, see\n\nCreating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card\n\n.\n\n##\n Custom Charts\n\nDomo has added support for custom data-driven maps. All you need to do is upload an image and Domo does the rest. You can create any maps pertinent to your business, such as maps for countries not available by default\u00a0in Domo, like this map of Hong Kong:\n\nOr you can build geographical maps divided by region, like this regionalized sales map for the United States:\n\nYou can even\u00a0build maps of objects like office layouts, assembly lines, production/shipping facilities, or seats on an airplane, like the following:\n\nAll of these maps\u00a0are powered by your own data, so any time your data updates, your maps will update as well.\n\n\n Depending on the complexity of your maps, you may be able to upload maps without having to edit the SVG, or you may need to make code changes, which will most likely require a working knowledge of XML.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nAdding Custom Charts to Domo\n\n.\n\n##\n Microsoft Word Plugin\n\nUse the Domo Word plugin to download cards or DataSet data from Domo\u00a0into Microsoft Word.\u00a0This is an excellent way to share your Domo data with others in your company who may not have access to Domo.\n\n\n Using this plugin, you can do all of the following:\n\n Import\n\nKPI\u00a0cards\n\nor individual components of KPI cards (such as chart/table content, summary numbers, owner name, etc.) into Word.\n* Use query tables to import DataSet data as selected fields or as a single value.\n* Highlight the Domo content in your Word document so viewers can recognize it immediately.\n* Refresh the content\u2014if anything has changed in the card or DataSet, it will be \"redownloaded.\"\n\nUsers with whom you share documents with Domo content do not need to have the plugin installed to edit or view those documents. However, if they want to update the Domo content, they must have the plugin installed.\n\n\n Just as with Domo's other Microsoft Office plugins, the Word plugin is not available for\u00a0the Mac OS.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nUsing the Domo Word Plugin\n\n.\n\n##\n NLQ Bots\n\nSometimes\u00a0you\u00a0just want to see single-valued key metrics in the fastest possible way. Domo's new Natural Language Query\u00a0(NLQ) Bots allow you\u00a0to query Domo directly from Buzz to get an answer in a language that everyone can understand.\n\n\n To use NLQ Bots, you\u00a0simply install a\u00a0Bot in Buzz, just like an app,\u00a0then query Buzz for information using natural language. Buzz returns a response to the query in natural language too. This enables business leaders to quickly get insights on demand on any platform that supports Buzz. For example, if you had the Shopify\u00a0Bot integrated with your Buzz, you would simply enter\n\n/shopify\n\nfollowed by a question such as \"how many refunds for march?\" Buzz would then generate and display the answer to your question. For any connector with NLQ Bots enabled, you can see several sample questions just by clicking the \"?\" icon next to the\n **Command Name**\n field.\n\nFor more information about Bots, see\n\nAdding a Bot to Buzz\n\n.\n\n##\n DomoStats\n\nIntroducing the freedom to explore what is happening in Domo for your company. Have you ever wondered how many users you have, who has logged in this past week, what cards are being created, and which DataSets are running? DomoStats lets MajorDomos and Admin users power up a QuickStart app with a pre-built dashboard with details about card views, user logins, and DataSet creation so they can see everything happening in their Domo. The live DataSets behind DomoStats gives you the visibility into these questions and the opportunity to build cards, alerts, and DataFlows around these new and powerful stats.\u00a0Find DomoStats\u00a0in the Appstore right now and get started exploring!\n\n\n###\n Unannounced Features and Enhancements\n\nThe following features have been available now for the past month but are just being\u00a0announced:\n\n##\n Custom Card Sizing\n\nWe are excited to announce custom sizing for Domo cards. Now you can display your cards using\u00a0custom size configurations to\u00a0more easily convey your business stories. From tall and skinny layouts, to wide and short views, to\u00a0really large full-page cards, you can choose the optimal sizes\u00a0for every card type while still maintaining the clean and grid organization you expect in your Domo dashboards. Emphasize your most important cards and shrink your supporting cards to draw attention to what really matters in your data.\n\n\n###\n Spark Line and Spark Bar Charts\n\nTwo new chart types have been added to Domo's expansive chart library, Spark Line and Spark Bar.\u00a0These new charts give\u00a0you even more options for presenting business stories to meet your company's needs.\n\n\n Spark\u00a0Line and Spark Bar graphs are similar in most respects to\u00a0standard Line and Bar graphs except that they\n\n include\u00a0a built-in gauge that shows the degree of change in the chart data, enabling you to answer your business questions at a glance, and\n* do not include axes, providing a simple and uncluttered view of rises and falls in your data.\n\n*Spark Line graph**\n\n*Spark Bar graph**\n\nFor more information about these chart types, see the following:\n\n Spark Line Graph\n* Spark Bar Graph\n\n\n###\n Map Improvements\n\nA number of improvements designed to increase usefulness of\u00a0maps have been released. You can now do all of the following:\n\n Zoom and pan on maps using your mouse's scroll button.\n* Add data labels to any map.\n* Toggle progressive disclosure of city names (i.e. more cities will appear on the map as you zoom in).\n* Filter to see selected regions.\n* Auto-zoom to show only those regions included in your DataSet.\n* Hide \"No Data\" items on the map.\n* Add hover text.\n* Create a full ZIP code map by filtering to one state.\n\nFor more information about all of these options, see\n\nProperties for Maps\n\n.\n\n\n Other News\n------------\n\n\n###\n Discontinuation Announcement for Workbench 2 and 3\n\nWorkbench 2 and 3 have been discontinued as of April 28, 2018.
