When the\n *actual*\n update does\n *not*\n occur within your expected update frequency, Domo displays a warning on the DataSet and cards powered by the DataSet. (The warning appears after a delay, depending on the specified frequency.) For connectors like Excel that do not include automatic update capability, you can choose how often\u00a0you want to receive\n\n\n reminders to update manually.\n\n\n**To set the expected update frequency for a DataSet,**\n\n. Click\n **Data**\n in the toolbar at the top of the screen.\n\n\n The Data Center opens, with the\n **Data Warehouse**\n tab opened by default.\n2. Click the\n\nicon on the left side of the screen to open the\n **DataSets**\n tab.\n3. Search for the DataSet you want, then view the details either by clicking the name or by clicking\n\n>\n **View Details**\n .\n\n\n A page appears showing details for the DataSet. If you are the owner of this DataSet or have an \"Admin\" default security profile or a custom role with the \"Manage DataSets\"\u00a0privilege enabled, a\n **Settings**\n tab appears in the tab row; otherwise this tab does not appear. (This tab also does not appear for a few unique connectors such as the Webform connector.) For more information about default security roles, see\n\nChanging the Owner of a DataSet\n\n.\n4. Click\n **Settings**\n .\n\n\n You should see several expandable sections with options for configuring the connector, such as \"Credentials,\" \"Details,\" and so on.\u00a0Note that the buttons you see may differ depending on the connector. For example, many connectors that pull public information do not have a\n **Credentials**\n section.\n5. Click\n **Scheduling**\n .\n6. Set\u00a0the desired update frequency.\n\n\n The controls for setting the update frequency depend on the connector. For connectors that don't have automatic update capability,\u00a0such as File Upload, only one menu appears; you\u00a0can choose a preset setting or leave it set to\n **Never**\n if you don't want to receive reminders to update this DataSet.\u00a0For most connectors, you can choose whether to use basic or advanced scheduling. For more information about scheduling, see\n\nConnecting to Data with Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you need your DataSet to update faster than every 15 minutes, please reach out to your account team for evaluation.\n7. When finished, click\n **Save**\n .\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042926114\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004897\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSetting the Expected Update Frequency for a DataSet\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,047\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:34 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "setting_the_expected_update_frequency_for_a_dataset", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "working_with_datasets_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000Zan2GAC"}, {"text": "data_center_overview", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanRGAS"}]}
