Domo's\u00a0Smartsheet connector allows you to retrieve data about folders, sheets, workspaces, users, and so on.\u00a0To learn more about the Smartsheet API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/\n\n).\n\n\n The Smartsheet connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to\u00a0the Smartsheet in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Smartsheet\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is typically used to pull spreadsheet data into Domo.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n N/A\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Product/project managers\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Depends on the amount of data and the scope of the system.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* As this connector does not support relative dates, \"Replace\" is the best choice for scheduling.\n* API calls are limited to 300 calls per minute. However, most reports do not result in a lot of calls (aside from the \"Users - All Sheets\" report).\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to the\u00a0Smartsheet API and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you entered when you signed up for a Smartsheet account\n* Your Smartsheet password\n\nConnecting to Smartsheet\n--------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Smartsheet connector\u00a0page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Smartsheet connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Smartsheet accounts in Domo)\n\n\n to open the\u00a0Smartsheet OAuth screen where you can enter your\u00a0Smartsheet\u00a0email address\u00a0and password. Once you have entered valid\u00a0credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Smartsheet DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n The SmartSheet connector requires that you reauthenticate your account throughout the life of the connection. For information about reauthenticating an account, see\n\nReconnecting Connectors for Accounts\n\n\n .\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary menu in which you select a report, along with two fields in which you can specify information to retrieve.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select\u00a0a Smartsheet report.

This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n###\n Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?\n\nAny Smartsheet account can be used to set up the connector.\n\n###\n How frequently should I update the connector?\n\nThere is no limitation in scheduling the connector. However, running many datasets frequently can cause API rate limit errors. Update the data only as often as needed and reduce the duplicate or unwanted datasets to avoid rate limit errors.\n\n###\n Can this connector pull custom fields?\n\nThe connector can pull your Smartsheet spreadsheets as they exist in Smartsheet. Ensure that the spreadsheets are formatted using the best practices for normalized data.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nBe aware that some \"User\" reports are available only to Team or Enterprise edition accounts.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930474\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003413\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSmartsheet Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,819\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "smartsheet_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
