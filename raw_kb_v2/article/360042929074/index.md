Sentry is an open-source error tracking platform that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. To learn more about the Sentry API, visit their

documentation page

 You connect to your Sentry account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sentry connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in
