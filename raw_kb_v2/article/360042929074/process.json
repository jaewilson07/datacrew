To learn more about the Sentry API, visit their\n\ndocumentation page\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Sentry account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sentry connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Sentry account and create a DataSet, you must have a Sentry API Auth Token. See Sentry's\n\nauthentication document\n\nto learn how to find or create authentication tokens within Sentry.\n\n\n Connecting to your Sentry Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the Sentry Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling,****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Sentry account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Auth Token\n  |\n Enter your Sentry API Auth Token. For more information, see\n\nPrerequisites\n\n, above.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid Sentry credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Sentry DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report\u00a0type\u00a0you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Sentry report you want to run.
