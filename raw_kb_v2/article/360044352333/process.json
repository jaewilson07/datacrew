(\n\nhttps://docs.anaplan.apiary.io/\n\n)\n\n\n You connect to your Anaplan account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Anaplan\u00a0Advanced V2 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Anaplan account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* An Anaplan\u00a0private key.\n* A CA-issued X509 certificate.\n\n\n For an in-depth guide to obtaining a certificate and exporting your private key, see\n\n\n https://community.anaplan.com/t5/Content-Sandbox/A-Guide-to-CA-Certificates-in-Anaplan-Integrations/ta-p/39305\n\n.\n\nConnecting to your Anaplan account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Anaplan Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your A\n\n\n naplan account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails pane\n\n\n In this pane you select the Anaplan workspace and model with the file/process you want to retrieve, as well as the name of the file or process itself.\n\n\n|\n\nMenu\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Select the user account\u00a0you want to retrieve data from.\n  |\n|\n\nWorkspaces\n\n|\n\nSelect the Anaplan workspace that contains the\u00a0file you want to retrieve.\n\n|\n|\n\nModels\n\n|\n Select the Anaplan model that contains the\u00a0file you want to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n Report Type\n  |\n Select the type of report you want to import, either\n **Exports**\n or\n **Processes**\n .\n  |\n|\n Files\n  |\n Select the file you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Process\n  |\n Select the process you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n\n\n###\n\nOther panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360044352333\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003314\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAnaplan Advanced V2 Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,657\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "anaplan_advanced_v2_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
