In that case, Pardot returns \"Client IP address/location must be activated before accessing API.\"\u00a0If that happens, Domo IP addresses must be whitelisted. For more information, see\n\nhttp://help.pardot.com/customer/port...ion-activation\n\n.\n* Pardot requires a very specific \"dictionary\" to decipher its results. The connector returns codes specific to every implementation. The mapping of codes to definitions requires significant maintenance.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500002456742\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003246\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSalesforce Pardot Connector with Single Sign-On support\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,451\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "salesforce_pardot_connector_with_single_signon_support", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
