To learn more about the Azure Blob Storage\u00a0API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/res...rvice-rest-api\n\n).\n\n\n You export data to Azure Blob Storage in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Azure Blob Storage\u00a0Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you will need the following:\n\n A Domo Client ID and Client Secret.\n* The name and key for your Azure Blob Storage account.\n\nThe following steps explain in detail how to create your project and obtain the needed credentials.\n\n\n To create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\nand log in.\n2. Click\n **New Client**\n (found under \"My Account\" in the top right corner).\n3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n\n\n When you click\n **Create**\n , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.\n4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Azure Blob Storage\u00a0Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo\u00a0developer\u00a0account as well as your Azure Blob Storage container. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Paste your Domo client ID. For more information, see\u00a0\"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Paste your Domo client secret. For more information, see\u00a0\"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Account Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the Azure Blob Storage account you want to connect to.\n  |\n|\n Account Key\n  |\n Enter the account key for the Azure Blob Storage account you want to connect to.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to set up a new Domo-Azure Blob Storage\u00a0connection. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a number of fields for specifying your data and indicating where it's going.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Blob Containers\n\n|\n Select the Azure Blob container you want to send your Domo data to.\n  |\n|\n Input DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to the selected Azure Blob Storage container. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\nhttps://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4/details/overview\n\n, the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4.\n\n|\n|\n Select Filename\n  |\n Select whether you want to reference your DataSet\u00a0using the\n ****Input DataSet ID****\n or an output file name.\n  |\n|\n Filename\n  |\n Enter the output file name for your data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436973\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004036\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMicrosoft Azure Blob Storage Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,748\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:18 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "microsoft_azure_blob_storage_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
