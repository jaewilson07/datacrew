Intro
-------

This connector is the source that fuels all your nerdy Star Wars fantasies. Get all the information about the Force, Sith and Empire you need, and much, much (startlingly so) more. You can receive any and all information concerning the films, people, planets, species, starships and vehicles of the Star Wars universe.


 You create a Star Wars DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Star Wars Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 The Star Wars Connector is a "Cloud App" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

None. Because this data is public, there is no need to enter connection information.

 Creating a Star Wars DataSet
------------------------------

To create a Star Wars DataSet, simply select the report and respective sub category you wish to retrieve data for in the
 **Details**
 pane. Then schedule updates and name and describe your new DataSet in the
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 panes. These panes are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 Troubleshooting
-----------------

Reach out to Domo Support if you experience issues with this Connector. Because no credentials are needed, any issues that arise are likely be internal Domo issues or problems with the Star Wars API.
