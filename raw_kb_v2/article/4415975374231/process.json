Get all the information about the Force, Sith and Empire you need, and much, much (startlingly so) more. You can receive any and all information concerning the films, people, planets, species, starships and vehicles of the Star Wars universe.\n\n\n You create a Star Wars DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Star Wars Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The Star Wars Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nNone. Because this data is public, there is no need to enter connection information.\n\n\n Details Pane\n--------------\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n\n\n**Reports**\n\n\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nChoose what Star Wars information you'd like to include in the report.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Films\n  |\n Retrieves the Star Wars films for the selected report category.\n  |\n|\n People\n  |\n Retrieves the list of Star Wars people for the selected report category and language.\n  |\n|\n Planets\n  |\n Retrieves the list of Star Wars planets for the selected report category and language.\n  |\n|\n Species\n  |\n Retrieves the list of Star Wars species for the selected report category and language.\n  |\n|\n Starships\n  |\n Retrieves the list of Star Wars starships for the selected report category and language.\n  |\n|\n Vehicles\n  |\n Retrieves the list of Star Wars vehicles for the selected report category and language.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Select Which Report You Would Like Expanded?\n  |\n\nBecause the Films report exclusively has memory issues, only one report can be chosen to be expanded.\n\n|\n|\n Choose Which Language You Would Like Your Information In?\n  |\n\nSpecify whether you would like to receive the information in English or Wookiee.\n\n|\n|\n Select Which Lists You Would Like Expanded?\n  |\n\nSelect the report categories that you would like to receive data for. You can select multiple categories here.\n\n|\n\n\n Other Panes\n-------------\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Creating a Star Wars DataSet\n------------------------------\n\nTo create a Star Wars DataSet, simply select the report and respective sub category you wish to retrieve data for in the\n **Details**\n pane.\u00a0Then schedule updates and name and describe your new DataSet in the\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n panes. These panes are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nReach out to Domo Support if you experience issues with this Connector. Because no credentials are needed, any issues that arise are likely be internal Domo issues or problems with the Star Wars API.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4415975374231\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003205\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nStar Wars Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,347\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "star_wars_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
