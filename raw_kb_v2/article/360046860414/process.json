Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nYou can\u00a0create a QuickBooks\u00a0DataSet Job\u00a0in Workbench 4. When\u00a0you select\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0as your\u00a0Data Source\u00a0type, you can choose a QuickBooks report type and specify options such as fiscal year, date granularity, and so on.\n\n\n**To create a\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0DataSet Job\u00a0in Workbench 4,**\n\n. Click\n **Add New**\n in the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n grouping in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window.\n\n\n This opens the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**\n .\n2. (Conditional) If requested, select the desired Domo server.\u00a0(This screen only appears if you have more than one server set up in Workbench.)\n3. In the\n **DataSet Job Name**\n field, enter a name for the DataSet Job. This is the name of the\u00a0job as it appears in Workbench,\n *not*\n the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.\n4. In the\n **DataSet Name**\n field, enter the name of the DataSet. This is the name of the uploaded DataSet in Domo.\n5. Select the desired\u00a0update method in the\n **Update Method**\n menu:\n\n* Select\n\t **Replace DataSet**\n\t if you want the DataSet to be replaced entirely upon updating.\n\t* Select\n\t **Append to DataSet**\n\t if you want\u00a0new data to be added to the existing data set upon updating.\n6. In the\n **Transport Method**\n menu,\u00a0select\n **Local File Provider,**\n**External Process File Provider**\n , or\n **FTP/SFTP File Provider**\n .\n\n\n Descriptions for these transport methods are as follows:\n\n\n|\n Transport Method\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Local File Provider\n  |\n Lets you select a file from your machine or a network.\n  |\n|\n External Process File Provider\n  |\n Lets you\u00a0use\u00a0a\u00a0third-party application to pull data into Domo using a script.\n  |\n|\n FTP/SFTP File Provider\n  |\n Lets you retrieve a file via FTP, SFTP (SSH-FTP), or FTPS (FTP-SSL)\n  |\n7. Click\n **Next**\n .\n8. In the\n **Data Source**\n menu, select\n **QuickBooks**\n .\n9. In the\n **DataSet Type**\n field, select\u00a0the type of DataSet in the dropdown or enter a custom name.\n\n\n The DataSet type you select\u00a0or enter here is reflected as\u00a0the connector type in Domo after you execute the job.\n\n*Tip:**\n It is recommended that you\u00a0select or enter\u00a0the DataSet type that tells users what data is being represented,\n *not*\n the data reader you are using to present the data. For example, you might be connecting to an Excel sheet that contains\u00a0QuickBooks data.\u00a0In this case the best option would be to\u00a0select\n **QuickBooks**\n rather than selecting\n **Excel**\n because the data you are representing in Domo is from QuickBooks, not Excel.\n10. (Optional) Enter a description in the\n **DataSet Description**\n field.\n\n*Note:**\n You can change any of the settings you made in the above steps in the\n **Source**\n panel for the DataSet Job after you complete all of the steps in the Wizard\n *except*\n the transport method.\n11. Click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n A new\u00a0QuickBooks DataSet Job is added to\u00a0the\u00a0list of jobs for the currently authenticated server in the\n **Accounts**\n pane.\n12. Under the\u00a0QuickBooks DataSet Job that was just added to the jobs list, select\n **Source**\n .\n\n\n A panel opens\u00a0with options for configuring your file transport and\u00a0setting options for\u00a0your\u00a0QuickBooks data source.\n13. Do one of the following:\n\n* If you selected\n\t **Local File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\t1. Click the ellipsis (...)\u00a0in the\n\t\t **File Path**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Select the desired\u00a0QuickBooks file from\u00a0your machine or network.\n\t* If you selected\n\t **External Process File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\t1. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t\t **Program Executable**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Select the desired executable file from your machine or network.\n\t\t3. (Optional) Enter arguments in the\n\t\t **Arguments**\n\t\t field, if any.\n\t\t4. Click the ellipsis (...) in the\n\t\t **Output File Path**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t5. Select the desired output file path on your machine or network.\n\n\n\t\t The file type for the output path\n\t\t *must*\n\t\t be QuickBooks.\n\t* If you selected\n\t **FTP/**\n\t**SFTP File Provider**\n\t as your Transport Method...\n\n\t1. Enter the server name in the\n\t\t **Server**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t2. Enter the port number in the\n\t\t **Port**\n\t\t field.\n\t\t3. Enter your server credentials in the\n\t\t **Username**\n\t\t and\n\t\t **Password**\n\t\t fields.\n\t\t4. Select the desired protocol (\n\t\t **FTP**\n\t\t ,\n\t\t **SFTP**\n\t\t , or\n\t\t **FTPS**\n\t\t ).\n\t\t5. (Optional) If you have an SSL certificate (SFTP and FTPS only), configure the settings as necessary.\n\n\n\t\t For more information about these settings, see\n\n\t SFTP\u00a0File Provider\n\n\t .\n\t\t6. In the\n\t\t **Remote File**\n\t\t field, enter the filename for the field you want to import.\n14. Click\n **Authorize Company File**\n in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window.\n\n\n The\n **Authorize QuickBooks Company File**\n wizard opens.\n15. Click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n QuickBooks is launched, and the file you selected opens.\n16. Ensure that you are logged into QuickBooks as an administrator and that the file is in multi-user mode.\n17. Click\n **Next**\n in Workbench.\n\n\n The QuickBooks file is authorized in Domo.\n18. Click\n **Validate Configuration**\n .\n19. (Optional) Check the box reading\n **Allow Workbench to stop QuickBooks on connection errors**\n if\u00a0you want\u00a0QuickBooks to shut down if Workbench encounters errors.\n20. Select the radio button for the desired report type.\n\n\n Primary report types are as follows:\n\n\n|\n Report\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n General Detail Report\n  |\n Shows detailed information for any of a number of different report types, such as \"Income by Customer Detail,\" \"Check Detail,\" \"Pending Sales,\" etc. You can select the desired date range for your report by selecting the start and end dates\u00a0using the\n **From**\n and\n **To**\n date pickers, respectively. If you want, you can manually select which columns appear in the report by selecting them in the\n **Columns**\n menu.\n  |\n|\n General Summary Report\n  |\n Shows summary information for any of a number of different report types, such as \"CustomerBalanceSummary,\" \"IncomeTaxSummary,\" \"PhysicalInventoryWorksheet,\" etc.\u00a0You can select the desired date range for your report by selecting the start and end dates\u00a0using the\n **From**\n and\n **To**\n date pickers, respectively. You can also select a date granularity for your report data (for example, you could summarize data by day, by month, etc.).\n  |\n|\n Budget Summary Report\n  |\n Shows balance sheet and profit and loss reports. You can select the desired fiscal year for your report.\n  |\n|\n List\n  |\n Shows any of a number of reports in list format, such as \"Employee\" (a list of company employees), \"Vendors\" (a list of your vendors), and so on. Because this information is not arranged by date, there are no options for setting a date range or choosing a fiscal year.\n  |\n21. (Conditional) Do one of the following:\n\n* If you selected\n\t **General Detail Report**\n\t ...\n\n\t1. Select a sub-report in the\n\t\t **General Detail Report**\n\t\t menu.\n\t\t2. In the\n\t\t **From**\n\t\t menu, select the start date for your report.\n\t\t3. (Conditional) If you want your report to pull data up until the current date each time it updates, leave the\n\t\t **Current Day**\n\t\t option selected in the\n\t\t **To**\n\t\t menu. Otherwise select the end date for the report in the menu.\n\t\t4.

Otherwise select the end date for the report in the menu.\n\t\t4. In the\n\t\t **Summarize Report Columns By**\n\t\t menu, select the date granularity for your report data. This determines how\u00a0data in the report is\u00a0broken down. For example, if you choose\n\t\t **Quarter**\n\t\t , data is broken down by quarter instead of month, week, etc.\n\t* If you selected\n\t **Budget Summary Report**\n\t ...\n\n\t1. Select a sub-report in the\n\t\t **Budget Summary Report**\n\t\t menu.\n\t\t2.
