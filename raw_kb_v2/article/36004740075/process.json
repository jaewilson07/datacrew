In these cells, you can write and format text, as well as write code using Python or R programming languages. When you execute the contents of a cell, the resulting output associated with the text or code displays directly in the notebook. The output can take various forms such as text, figures, tables, and images. You can add, edit, move, duplicate, re-run, and delete cells within a notebook at your discretion. You can also run cells sequentially to perform different phases of your project one after the other. For example, the first cell in your notebook could contain code to read in your DataSet; the second cell could then contain code that specifies what analysis to run on the DataSet.\n\n\n See\n\nCells\n\nto learn about the types of cells, how to add them to a notebook, and how to execute them.\n\n\n Because a Jupyter notebook file can display executable code and the associated code output, along with explanatory text and images, a notebook can serve as a complete record of your interactive session.\n\n\n You can save a Jupyter notebook to your Jupyter workspace, enabling you to access your notebook and its contents in the future. Jupyter notebooks are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb extension.\n\n\n You can also download a notebook from your workspace and save it elsewhere or share it.\n\n*Note:**\n You can create and save multiple Jupyter notebooks within a single Jupyter workspace.\n\nThis image displays an example of a Jupyter notebook.\n\nBack to top\n\n##\n\n\n Edit Jupyter Notebooks\n\n\n**Important:**\n In order to edit a notebook, you first have to create and then start (or run) a workspace.

What you can enter into a cell, as well the cell's output on execution, is determined by the cell type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells, described below.\n\n **Code cells \u2014**\n In these cells, you can write and edit code. The programming language that you use to write code depends on the type of kernel (either Python or R) that you selected when creating your Jupyter workspace. After you execute or run a code cells, the output of the code displays directly below the code cell. The output can take various forms such as text, figures, tables, and images.\n* **Markdown cells \u2014**\n In these cells, you can write text. You can also use Markdown language to mark up or format text, including italicizing and bolding, specifying lists, and creating headings. After you execute or run a markdown cell, the text you wrote is formatted into rich text. You can learn about\n\nbasic Markdown synxtax\n\nhere.\n* **Raw cells \u2014**\n In these cells, you can write output directly or save code that you don't want to run.\n\n\n You can determine a cell's type by selecting the cell and viewing the list in the toolbar at the top of the notebook. In this example, the notebook contains a code cell. See\n\nChange Cell Type\n\nfor more information.\n\nBack to top\n\n###\n\n\n Change Cell Type\n\nYou can change a cell's type by selecting the cell and then selecting the cell type menu in the toolbar and choosing the cell type you want: code, markdown, or raw.

Use the\n `domo.write_dataframe`\n command to write results back to the Domo Data sources configured for the Jupyter workspace.\n\n\n See the example below:\n\nBack to top\n\n##\n\n\n Use Append, Upsert, and Partition\n\nUse the following commands to update a DataSet:\n\n domo.write\\_dataframe(df, output\\_dataset)\n* domo.write\\_dataframe(df, output\\_dataset, update\\_method=\"APPEND\")\n* domo.write\\_dataframe(df, output\\_dataset, update\\_method=\"UPSERT\", update\\_key=column\\_name)\n* domo.write\\_dataframe(df, output\\_dataset, update\\_method=\"PARTITION\", partition\\_name=\u2019Example Name\u2019)\n\n\n For information on which update method to use, see our\n\nDataSet Update Methods\n\narticle.\n\nBack to top\n\n##\n\n\n Use Accounts\n\n\n Third-party accounts can be referenced in a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library. This library provides useful functionality to interact with Domo within Jupyter.\n\nBefore account keys and values can be accessed, your workspace must have an account.\n\n\n If you are creating a new workspace, see the earlier section,\n\nCreating a Workspace.\n\nIf your workspace already exists but doesn't have a third-party account attached, follow the steps below:\n\n\n 1. In Jupyter Workspaces, locate your workspace from the list. You can search and filter by owner.\n\n\n 2. Hover over your workspace. The\n\n*Manage Workspace**\n menu displays.\n\n\n 3. Select the\n\n*Manage Workspace**\n menu and choose\n **Edit**\n .\n\n\n The\n **Edit Jupyter Workspace**\n modal displays.\n\n\n 4. In the\n **Edit Jupyter Workspace**\n view, select\n **Accounts**\n >\n **Add Account**\n and select a third-party account.\n\n\n 5. After making your selection, select\n **Save Workspace.**\n\n\n The workspace has a third-party account set up. Keys and values can now be read into a Jupyter Notebook using the domojupyter library.\n\n\n 6. The following commands can be used to get account information:\n\n `domo.get_account_property_value('account')`\n\nwill return the specific value assigned to a property on your account.\n* `domo.get_account_property_value('account',account_properties[0])`\n will return all properties that exist in an account.\n\nSee the example below, where 'S3Account' is the account being referenced:\n\n\n###\n\n\n Back to top\n\n\n###\n\n\n Install and Use Libraries\n\nLibraries can be installed in the Jupyter workspace by opening a terminal and executing the appropriate commands. An example command to install the Seaborn library is\n `conda install seaborn -y`\n . Once installed, these libraries can be imported and used within the Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n\n See the example below:\n\nBack to top\n\n##\n\n\n Usage Monitoring\n\nYou can monitor Jupyter usage within Domo. As a prerequisite, you need to be assigned either the default Admin role or a custom role with the View Usage Metrics and Manage Jupyter Workspaces grants.\n\n\n Follow the steps below to create a custom role with usage-based billing access.\n\n. Clone an existing role such as the default Admin role.\n2. Remove any grants from the cloned role that are not needed for a billing admin.\n3. Add the View Usage Metrics and Manage Jupyter Workspaces grants to this role.\n\nYou can learn more about creating custom roles in our article on\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n\n After you create the role, follow these steps to view your usage:\n\n. In the navigation header, go to\n **More**\n >\n **Admin\n **.****\n2. On the\n **Admin**\n screen in the\n **Company settings**\n menu, select\n **Usage**\n .\n3. Go to the\n **Jupyter Compute**\n tab.\n\nBack to top\n\n\n FAQ\n-------\n\n*Can I install Plugins?**\n\n\n Plugins are not currently supported.\n\n\n**Can I trial the feature?**\n\n\n Please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Executive (AE) for the most up-to-date information on the trial experience of Jupyter.\n\n\n**Does Domo offer data science services?**\n\n\n Yes, we have a team of experienced data scientists ready to help as needed. Please contact your Account Executive (AE) for more information.\n\n\n**How do I change the kernel?**\n\n\n First, you must stop the workspace. You may then change the kernel in the Domo workspace edit view.\n\n\n**Can I reset the kernel?**\n\n\n Yes. When you hover over a workspace, the\n\n*Manage Workspaces**\n menu displays. Choose\n **Restore Kernel Defaults**\n from the options. All instances must be stopped to fulfill this action.\n\n\n**Do I need to know how to code using Python or R programming languages in order to use a Jupyter notebook?**\n\n\n If you want to do any kind of data exploration or analysis (such as load a DataSet, develop data science models or machine learning pipelines, create custom data tables or figures, or write transformed data back into Domo) in a notebook, you need experience with either R or Python.\n\n\n**I'm experiencing issues integrating third-party libraries.**\n\nDomo's Jupyter integration allows users to install third-party libraries. However, Domo does not natively support every third-party library. Some third-party libraries may require more effort on the user's end to install, configure, and troubleshoot.\n\n*Can I integrate Jupyter Workspaces with GitHub?**\n\n\n Domo supports integrating and maintaining git repositories within the Jupyter Workspaces interface. After you complete integration, you can repeatedly push updates (including updated Jupyter notebook files) from Jupyter Workspaces to the GitHub repository you select using standard Git operations. See\n\nUse Jupyter Workspaces with GitHub\n\nfor more information.\n\nExperiencing issues? See the\n\nJupyter Troubleshooting Guide\n\nor contact\n\nsupport@domo.com\n\nfor assistance.\n\nBack to top\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 36004740075\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004975\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nJupyter Workspaces User Guide\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 7,657\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 11/1/2022, 11:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 11/1/2022, 11:23 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "jupyter_workspaces_user_guide", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "other_connection_methods", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanzGAC"}]}
