Workspaces are tightly integrated with Domo to allow users to easily explore their Domo DataSets, leverage instantaneous code execution to develop pipelines for data science and machine learning, document their processes, create custom visualizations, and write transformed data back into Domo.\n                       \n\n                        Jupyter Workspaces use the JupyterLab\u00a0interface.

In these cells, you can write and format text, as well as write code using Python or R programming languages. When you execute the contents of a cell, the resulting output associated with the text or code displays directly in the notebook. The output can take various forms such as text, figures, tables, and images. You can add, edit, move, duplicate, re-run, and delete cells within a notebook at your discretion. You can also run cells sequentially to perform different phases of your project one after the other. For example, the first cell in your notebook could contain code to read in your DataSet; the second cell could then contain code that specifies what analysis to run on the DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        See\n                        \n                         Cells\n                        \n                        to learn about the types of cells, how to add them to a notebook, and how to execute them.\n                        \n\n                        Because a Jupyter notebook file can display executable code and the associated code output, along with explanatory text and images, a notebook can serve as a complete record of your interactive session.\n                        \n\n                        You can save a Jupyter notebook to your Jupyter workspace, enabling you to access your notebook and its contents in the future. Jupyter notebooks are internally JSON files and are saved with the .ipynb extension.\n                       \n\n                        You can also download a notebook from your workspace and save it elsewhere or share it.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           You can create and save multiple Jupyter notebooks within a single Jupyter workspace.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        This image displays an example of a Jupyter notebook.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Back to top\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Edit Jupyter Notebooks\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Important:\n                           \n                           In order to edit a notebook, you first have to create and then start (or run) a workspace.

What you can enter into a cell, as well the cell's output on execution, is determined by the cell type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells, described below.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Code cells \u2014\n                         \n                         In these cells, you can write and edit code. The programming language that you use to write code depends on the type of kernel (either Python or R) that you selected when creating your Jupyter workspace. After you execute or run a code cells, the output of the code displays directly below the code cell. The output can take various forms such as text, figures, tables, and images.\n                        \n\n\n                          Markdown cells \u2014\n                         \n                         In these cells, you can write text. You can also use Markdown language to mark up or format text, including italicizing and bolding, specifying lists, and creating headings. After you execute or run a markdown cell, the text you wrote is formatted into rich text.
