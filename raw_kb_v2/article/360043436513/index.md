Intro
-------

A character-separated values (CSV) file stores tabular data in plain text form. The Domo CSV Advanced connector allows you to access CSV files that you have uploaded to an SFTP server. You can also import files via HTTPS calls.

*Note:**
 Due to security concerns, Domo no longer permits uploading data using FTP. If necessary, please update your server settings to support SFTP instead of FTP.

You connect to CSV files in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the CSV Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Best Practices
----------------

If you are using SFTP, make sure your credentials are ready and verified via your SSH key. The accepted formats for the key are either DES or RSA. If you are using HTTPS, you only need to verify that your resource is protected.


 Prerequisites
---------------

If you plan to access CSV files by connecting to an SFTP server, you must have a username and password to authenticate to that server. If you plan to access CSV files over HTTPS, credentials are required only if the resource is protected.


 You need the username and password associated with your CSV file. You also your SSH key and the passphrase for your ssh key.


**Note: Domo does not support the SSH keys generated using ssh-keygen. The SSH keys need to be the DES or RSA keys (in PEM format) generated by OpenSSL.**


 Connecting to CSV Files
-------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 ,
 **Details**
 , and
 **Advanced**
 panes in the CSV Advanced Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


###

Credentials Pane

In this pane you may need to enter a username and password, depending on what protocol you are using to access CSV data and whether the data is protected. If you plan to access CSV files by connecting to an SFTP server, you must enter the credentials for that server here (username, password, and host name). If you plan to access files over HTTPS, you only need to enter credentials if the resource is protected. You must also whitelist the IP addresses from the following article on the server:

Whitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors

.


 In either case, once you click
 **Next**
 , this CSV account is saved and you can use the same account any time you go to create a new CSV Advanced DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.


 You may also have the option to import the CSV file from a URL. If this is the case, you need the URL and potentially a username and password, depending on whether the source requires them.

##
 Details Pane

In this pane you choose a protocol (HTTP request or SFTP file transfer) then fill in the details for that protocol. This pane includes the following fields and menus:

*Note:**
 Due to security concerns, Domo no longer permits uploading data using FTP. If necessary, please update your server settings to support SFTP instead of FTP.


|
 Menu
  |
 Description
  |
| --- | --- |
|
 Protocol
  |
 Select a protocol for accessing the CSV file.


 Use SFTP to access a CSV file located on an SFTP server.


 Use HTTP Request to access a CSV file using an HTTP GET request. The request is triggered by the use of a unique URL parameter defined by the service providing the CSV file.
  |
|
 URL
  |
 Enter the URL for the CSV file.

If using the File Transfer protocol, enter the URL to the folder containing the CSV file. For example: s

ftp://hostname/home/test

. You'll also have to include the port in the URL if the SFTP server is not configured to run on the standard port 22. The 1234 port specific URL would look like s

ftp://hostname:1234/home/test

*Note:**
 Due to security concerns, Domo no longer permits uploading data using FTP. If necessary, please update your server settings to support SFTP instead of FTP.

If using the HTTP Request protocol, enter the full URL for the CSV file. You must provide the URL as well as the fully qualified path, including the filename. For example:

http://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/eqr/...v/contract.txt

If you are using the SFTP protocol, you can request a file for a specific date. You need to name your file using the format

file\_[yyyyMMdd]\_suffix.csv

. You can also select the most recent file using the format

filenameprefix\_[latest]

.
