In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This is the simplified version of the Lithium connector. There is also an advanced version that contains many more reports and configuration options. For more information, see\n\nLithium Advanced Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Lithium account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Lithium connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n User community management and activity\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Users with the most kudos\n* Escalated threads\n* Registered users\n* Visiting users\n* Number of posts with solutions\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Community roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 1-2 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Lithium account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password for your\u00a0Lithium account.\n* The server URL for your Lithium instance. For example:\n\nhttps://community.company.com\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Lithium Account\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Lithium\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Lithium account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the username for your Lithium account.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter\u00a0the password for your Lithium account.\n  |\n|\n Base URL\n  |\n Enter the server URL for your Lithium instance. For example:\n\nhttps://community.company.com\n\n|\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Lithium credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Lithium DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary\u00a0menu from which you can select a report, along with various other fields and menus that may or may not appear depending on your selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0Lithium report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Leaderboard of Kudos Authors\n  |\n Returns a list of the users who have received the most kudos in the community. (Leaderboard must be enabled in the community for this report to run.)\n  |\n|\n List of Escalated Threads\n  |\n Returns a list of escalated threads in the community.\n  |\n|\n List of Posts\n  |\n Returns a list of posts for all or selected boards.\n  |\n|\n List of Solutions\n  |\n Returns a list of accepted solutions for all or selected boards.\n  |\n|\n List of Registered Users\n  |\n Returns a list of registered users in the community.\n  |\n|\n List of Visiting Users\n  |\n Returns a list of\u00a0users who visited the community during the specified time period.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Time Period\n  |\n Select the desired time period for the report data. If you select\n **All**\n , all available data is shown.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days\u00a0of data to be\u00a0retrieved. For example, if you entered\n `30`\n , data would be retrieved for\u00a0the last 30 days.\n  |\n|\n All or Specific Boards\n  |\n Select whether you want your report to show all boards or\u00a0one or more\u00a0specific boards.\n  |\n|\n Boards\n  |\n Select the boards you want to\u00a0retrieve data for.\n\n\n |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042929854\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003470\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nLithium Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,640\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "lithium_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
