Domo has updated the Dropbox for Business connectors so that our customers can leverage the new Dropbox v2 API. Due to changes in authentication and schema in the new API, we will be deprecating the 2.x version of the Domo\u00a0Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors. In addition, Domo plans to consolidate the two connectors into a single Dropbox for Business Advanced connector. In order to minimize the interruptions with your Dropbox data, please be aware of the following dates for these changes.\n\n\n**May 31, 2019**\n : The 2.x version of the Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be deprecated. Customers will still have access to all existing DataSets but will no longer be able to create new ones using the 2.x connectors. The updated 3.x version of the Dropbox for Business Advanced connector will be available for use on this date. In order to create new DataSets, customers will need to create a new Dropbox\u00a0for Business Advanced DataSet and enter\u00a0credentials there. Customers should begin migrating/re-creating existing Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced DataSets immediately to use the new 3.x Dropbox for Business Advanced connector.\n\n\n**June 19, 2019**\n : The 2.x versions of the Dropbox\u00a0for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be disabled DataSets created using these versions of the connectors will no longer function. Customers will need to have created new accounts and DataSets using the updated 3.x version of Dropbox for Business Advanced connector by this date.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\n\n Dropbox for Business is\u00a0a file sharing and storage solution that\u00a0allows\u00a0users to share, store, and sync files securely. You can use Domo's\u00a0Dropbox for Business connector to\u00a0compile reports about account information, team information, audit log, and team usage statistics. To learn more about the Dropbox for Business API, go to\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/developers/business\n\n.\n\n\n Domo also includes an advanced Dropbox for Business connector that\n\noffers an additional report (\"Groups Information\")\u00a0and provides additional filtering options for the \"Audit Log\"\u00a0report. For more information, see\n\nDropbox For Business Advanced Connector\n\n.\n\nThis topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Dropbox for Business connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to get information about system usage and make governance decisions.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Storage usage\n* Membership\n* User activity\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Dropbox system administrator\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Dropbox account and create a Dropbox for Business connector DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The account you use to log into your Dropbox account.\n* The password you use to log into your Dropbox account.\n\nIf you don't have credentials you can get them here:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/business\n\n\n Connecting to your Dropbox account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Dropbox for Business connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n The Domo Dropbox for Business connector uses OAuth to connect to Dropbox for Business.

This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n####\n What's the difference between this connector and Dropbox\u00a0For Business Advanced connector?\n\nThe Dropbox For Business Advanced connector offers an additional report for\u00a0\"Groups Information\"\u00a0and provides additional filtering options for the \"Audit Log\"\u00a0report.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930214\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003439\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDropbox for Business Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,647\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "dropbox_for_business_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
