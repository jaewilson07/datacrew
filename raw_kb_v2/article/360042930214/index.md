**Important:**
 Dropbox has deprecated the Dropbox for Business v1 API and disabled the endpoints as of May 30, 2019. Domo has updated the Dropbox for Business connectors so that our customers can leverage the new Dropbox v2 API. Due to changes in authentication and schema in the new API, we will be deprecating the 2.x version of the Domo Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors. In addition, Domo plans to consolidate the two connectors into a single Dropbox for Business Advanced connector. In order to minimize the interruptions with your Dropbox data, please be aware of the following dates for these changes.


**May 31, 2019**
 : The 2.x version of the Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be deprecated. Customers will still have access to all existing DataSets but will no longer be able to create new ones using the 2.x connectors. The updated 3.x version of the Dropbox for Business Advanced connector will be available for use on this date. In order to create new DataSets, customers will need to create a new Dropbox for Business Advanced DataSet and enter credentials there. Customers should begin migrating/re-creating existing Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced DataSets immediately to use the new 3.x Dropbox for Business Advanced connector.


**June 19, 2019**
 : The 2.x versions of the Dropbox for Business and Dropbox for Business Advanced connectors will be disabled DataSets created using these versions of the connectors will no longer function. Customers will need to have created new accounts and DataSets using the updated 3.x version of Dropbox for Business Advanced connector by this date.

Credentials Pane


 The Domo Dropbox for Business connector uses OAuth to connect to Dropbox for Business. (Domo does not store or transmit user passwords.) Click
 **Connect**

 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Dropbox accounts in Domo) to open the Dropbox OAuth screen where you can enter the account and password associated with your Dropbox account. After you have entered valid Dropbox credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Dropbox for Business DataSet.

 FAQ
-----


#####
 How do I know my Dropbox account credentials are secure?

The login process uses the OAuth process, so your Dropbox credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.

####
 How often can the data be updated?

As often as needed.

####
 Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?

No.

####
 What's the difference between this connector and Dropbox For Business Advanced connector?

The Dropbox For Business Advanced connector offers an additional report for "Groups Information" and provides additional filtering options for the "Audit Log" report.
