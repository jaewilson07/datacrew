For each individual series, information about that series is provided in the other columns in the table. By default, this information includes the name of the series, an indicator showing whether the percent change for the series is positive or negative, and the degree of change. However, in the Chart Properties for the table, you can change columns to reflect any of a variety of other aspects of the series, such as the minimum or maximum value in the chart, the second-to-last value, a change value (as opposed to a percentage), etc. You can also add additional columns to the table (up to 10) with this information.\n                       \n\n                        As a visual example, let's look at how a standard chart might appear when represented instead as a flex table. In the following Stacked Bar chart, \"Finance: AR Aging,\" information is provided for May 2013 to April 2015. Three series are shown, \"AR <30,\" \"AR 30-60,\" and \"AR 60+.\"\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        This chart is helpful for showing overall trends in the data but not so much for revealing details about the individual AR buckets. For example, if a user was interested only in \"AR 60+,\" he would probably not find this chart useful at all, as that series is sandwiched between the other two series and is nearly impossible to analyze.\n                        \n\n                        If the data in the preceding chart were instead portrayed using a flex table with the default \"Line\" type, it would appear as follows:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Now all three series are shown separately, making it significantly easier to compare trends over the given time period. In addition, red and green indicators show whether change for a series is positive or negative, and the last column shows the percentages of change. With this table, the user interested in \"AR 60+\" can see at a glance how this bucket is doing. If he wanted, he could even add additional columns to show more data, such as minimum and maximum values, last and penultimate values, etc.\n                       \n\n                        For information about standard and heat map tables, see\n                        \n                         Table Chart\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Alternate use cases\n                       \n\n                        Flex tables are usually used to show trend data, as explained in the preceding example. However, many other use cases are possible. For example, you could create a table that uses bars to show the difference between values for the previous and current years, like in the below screenshot:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Powering flex tables\n                       \n\n                        Flex tables require at least three\u00a0columns or rows of data from your DataSet.\n                       \n\n\n\n                          One of these contains the data being measured (category data), which will typically be dates. This column\u00a0is dropped onto the\n                          \n                           X Axis\n                          \n                          field. Because the flex table divides up all series into separate rows, you do not actually see the x-axis with category labels. However, you can see the labels by hovering over the bars or the individual points in the\u00a0line.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Another column contains the value data for the table; this column is dropped onto the\n                          \n                           Y Axis\n                          \n                          field.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A third column contains series data; this column is dropped onto the\n                          \n                           Region\n                          \n                          field. You can add as many additional series columns to your chart as you want. Each series you add to the chart is represented as an individual row with its line or bar chart.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        For information about value, category, and series data, see\n                        \n                         Understanding Chart Data\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your flex table.

Notably, in the Chart Properties, you can change the aspect of each series that appears in each column as well as add new columns. By default, flex tables include columns for series names, charts, change indicators (positive or negative), and the percent of change, as shown in the preceding screenshot. Other available aspects you can change include minimum value, maximum value, penultimate (second-to-last) value, change value, etc.\n                       \n\n                        Many other Chart Properties are available as well.\u00a0For information about all chart properties, see\n                        \n                         Applying and Resetting\u00a0Chart Properties\n                        \n                        .\u00a0Unique properties of flex tables include the following.

For example, if you selected\n                            \n                             Penultimate Value\n                            \n                            for\n                            \n                             Column 5\n                            \n                            , a fifth column would be added to the table, portraying the penultimate value in the data for each series.\n                           \n\n                            The screenshot shows a flex table in which nearly all aspects are shown (except for\n                            \n                             Penultimate Value\n                            \n                            ).\n                           \n\n                            The options in this menu are as follows:\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Default\n                               \n\n\n\n                                The default aspect of the series represented in each column.
