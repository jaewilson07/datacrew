Example of DATETIME data:\n                            \n                             '2014-08-14 15:05:30'\n                            \n                            . All DATETIME fields in your data are visualized based on the assumption that your \"current time\" is UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). For example, if you were in New York City and your data is time-stamped in UTC, the date changes at 7:00PM since UTC is 5 hours ahead of Eastern time zone. The new time zone setting compensates for this situation. (If your data were already time-stamped in Eastern Time, you would\n                            \n                             not\n                            \n                            need to set the new time zone feature.)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Enabled\n                           \n\n\n\n                            When the global corporate time zone setting is enabled, all DATETIME data sent into Domo\n                            \n                             must be\n                            \n                            in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
