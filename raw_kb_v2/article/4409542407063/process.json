It also stores all of the pop-up guides and walkthroughs of new features so that you can review them again once you have closed the window.\n\n\n To access the Resource Library, click the\n\nicon in the bottom corner of your screen. The Resource Library consists of three parts:\n\n Guides and walkthroughs\n* Resources\n* Product announcements\n\n\n Guides and walkthroughs\n-------------------------\n\nThe Guides and walkthroughs section contains all of the information in the pop-up windows when you first log into Domo. These can now be re-triggered to go over the information again.\n\n*Note:**\n The list will only display features that are relevant to the current Page you are on. For example, if a Guide is for something in the Data Center, you will need to be on the Data Center Page for the Guide to display in the list.\n\n\n Resources\n-----------\n\nThe Resources section has quick links to:\n\n **Help Center**\n - Takes you to the Help Center page that has additional resource links to Domo University, Videos, Knowledge Base, and the Community Forum.\n* **Developer Portal**\n - Takes you to the Domo Developer\u00a0site.\n* **New feature releases**\n - Takes you to the New Features site.\n\n\n Product announcements\n-----------------------\n\nThe Product announcements section shows any new product features that are available along with the current release notes.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4409542407063\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004329\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nResource Library\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,834\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:40 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "resource_library", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "getting_to_know_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamsGAC"}, {"text": "getting_started", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanlGAC"}]}
