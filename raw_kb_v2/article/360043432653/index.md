Best Practices
----------------

This connector works best when "Replace" is used to update data instead of "Append."


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Jobvite account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 A Jobvite secret key
* A Jobvite company ID
* A Jobvite API key

All of these credentials are provided upon account creation.


 Connecting to Your Jobvite Account
------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Jobvite Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

Credentials Pane


 This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Jobvite account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:
