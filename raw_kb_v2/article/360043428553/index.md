Card Pages
------------

Card Pages are Pages you add yourself to your instance. These comes in two types:

 Standard Card Pages. Users can personalize these basic Pages by rearranging and resizing Cards and creating Collections. Other functionality such as borders and headers, background colors, drill-in-place, etc. is available only in Domo Stories Pages, not standard Pages.
* Domo Stories Pages. These Pages can only be personalized within a special Edit view, ensuring that all users see the same thing in a Page. Cards in a Domo Stories Page also appear the same no matter what device or platform you are using. These Pages also provide many more personalization options than standard Pages, such as headers, borders, background colors. You can also specify what actions occur when Cards are clicked (drill-in-place, opening an external URL, etc.). For more information about Domo Stories, see
