To learn more about the SurveyMonkey API, visit their website. (\n\nhttps://developer.surveymonkey.com/\n\n)\n\n\n You connect to your SurveyMonkey account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SurveyMonkey connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Survey and response analysis\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Number of people who responded to a survey\n* Response counts\n* Number of completed surveys\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Marketing roles\n* HR roles\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nUse this connector to pull historical data, then append new data via a recursive DataFlow. For more information, see\n\nCreating a Recursive/Snapshot Magic ETL DataFlow\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your SurveyMonkey account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password you use to log into your SurveyMonkey account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your SurveyMonkey Account\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SurveyMonkey Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo SurveyMonkey connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing SurveyMonkey accounts in Domo) to open the SurveyMonkey OAuth screen where you can enter your SurveyMonkey credentials. Once you have entered valid SurveyMonkey credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new SurveyMonkey DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into SurveyMonkey when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of SurveyMonkey.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the SurveyMonkey report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Surveys Details\n  |\n Returns data about all or selected surveys.\n  |\n|\n Collector List\n  |\n Returns data about collectors for a selected survey.\n  |\n|\n Responses\n  |\n Returns data about responses for a selected survey.\n  |\n|\n Survey Details\n  |\n Returns details for a selected survey.\n  |\n|\n Survey List\n  |\n Returns a list of completed surveys.\n  |\n|\n User Details\n  |\n Returns information about the current user.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n One or All Surveys\n  |\n Select whether to\u00a0retrieve data from all surveys or a single selected survey.\n  |\n|\n All or New Data\n  |\n Select how much data to retrieve. If you select\n **All data**\n , the report\u00a0retrieves all data within the\u00a0given\n **Start Days**\n and\n **End Days**\n range. If you select\n **Since last successful run**\n , the report\u00a0retrieves all data since the last successful update. If this is a new DataSet, the run\u00a0retrieves data\u00a0for the number of days specified in\n **Start Days**\n .\n  |\n|\n Start Days\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **End Days**\n to create a range of represented days. For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Start Days**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **End Days**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago. Use\n\n0\n\nfor today.\n  |\n|\n End Days\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Start Days**\n to create a range of represented days. For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Start Days**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **End Days**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago. Use\n\n0\n\nfor today.\n  |\n|\n Collector\n  |\n Select the collector\u00a0for whom\u00a0you want to retrieve data.\n  |\n|\n Survey\n  |\n Select\u00a0the survey for which you want to retrieve data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930754\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003386\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSurveyMonkey Advanced Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,696\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "surveymonkey_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
