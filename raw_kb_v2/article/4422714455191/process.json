Using the Entrata API to pull data into Domo, you'll get a consistent and reliable data connection that you can use to monitor income and expenses of properties, financial picklist, leads, lease and more so that you can get the most out of your Entrata platform.\n\nFor more information about the Entrata API, visit their website. (\n\nhttps://www.entrata.com/api-documentation\n\n)\n\n\n The Entrata V2 connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Entrata account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Entrata V2 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Entrata account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Entrata username and password\n* Your Entrata account domain. For example, if you logged into Entrata at '\n\ndomo.entrata.com\n\n', your domain would be 'domo'.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Entrata Account\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Entrata V2 Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Entrata V2 account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Entrata username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Entrata\u00a0password.\n  |\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Enter the account domain for your Entrata instance.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\u00a0Entrata credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Entrata V2 DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu in which you select a report type. Depending on the report type you select, other options may be available.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select an Entrata V2 report.
