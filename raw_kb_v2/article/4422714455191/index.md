Intro
-------


 Entrata is property management software for property owners, property managers, and residents. Using the Entrata API to pull data into Domo, you'll get a consistent and reliable data connection that you can use to monitor income and expenses of properties, financial picklist, leads, lease and more so that you can get the most out of your Entrata platform.

For more information about the Entrata API, visit their website. (

 The Entrata V2 connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Entrata account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Entrata V2 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in
