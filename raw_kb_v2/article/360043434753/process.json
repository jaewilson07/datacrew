You can use Domo's Yammer\u00a0connector to retrieve data about networks, suggestions, users, messages, and notifications.\u00a0To learn more about the\u00a0Yammer API, go to\n\nhttps://developer.yammer.com/restapi/\n\n.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Yammer connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Yammer account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address from your organization you\u00a0used\u00a0when you\u00a0set up your Yammer account. This email address\u00a0must contain your organization's Internet domain (such as\n\n\n domo.com\n\n\n ).\n* Your\u00a0Yammer password.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Yammer Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Yammer Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Yammer connector uses OAuth to connect. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Yammer accounts in Domo)\n\n\n to open the\u00a0Yammer OAuth screen where you can enter your\u00a0Yammer email address and password. After you\u00a0enter your credentials, you must authorize Yammer to connect\u00a0to Domo by clicking\n **Allow**\n .\u00a0Once you have entered valid\u00a0Yammer credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Yammer DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0Yammer when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Yammer.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu, along with various other fields and menus that may or may not appear depending on the selected report type.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Yammer\u00a0report.
