Intro
-------

BigQuery is a data platform to create, manage, share and query data. Domo's BigQuery Unload connector lets you bring in larger results from BigQuery through the assistance of the Google Cloud Storage service. To learn more about the BigQuery API, go to

https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/

.


 The Google BigQuery Unload connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 ****Cloud App****
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google BigQuery Unload connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to BigQuery and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 A JSON BigQuery service account key
* A JSON Google Cloud Storage service account key
* A Domo client ID
* A Domo client secret

To generate the necessary service account keys, do the following:

. In the GCP Console, open the IAM & Admin page.
2. Click
 ****Service accounts****
 in the left-hand navigation pane.
3. Select your project and click
 ****Open****
 .
4. Click
 ****Create Service Account****
 .
5. Enter a name and description for the service account.
6. Click
 ****Create****
 .
7. Select
 ****Project Owner****

8. Click
 ****Continue****
 .
9. Click
 ****Create key****
 .
10. Select
 ****JSON****
 as the key type.
11. Click
 ****Create****
 .

A private key will be saved to your computer.


 To create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:

. Navigate to

https://developer.domo.com

and log in.
2. Click
 ****New Client****
 (found under "My Account" in the top right corner).
3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of
 ****Data****
 and
 ****User****
 .


 When you click
 ****Create****
 , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.
4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.
