Domo's BigQuery Unload connector lets you bring in larger results from BigQuery through the assistance of the Google Cloud Storage service. To learn more about the\u00a0BigQuery\u00a0API, go to\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/\n\n.\n\n\n The Google BigQuery\u00a0Unload connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n ****Cloud App****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Google BigQuery\u00a0Unload connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to BigQuery\u00a0and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A JSON BigQuery service account key\n* A JSON Google Cloud Storage service account key\n* A Domo\u00a0client ID\n* A Domo client secret\n\nTo generate the necessary service account keys, do the following:\n\n. In the GCP Console, open the IAM\u00a0& Admin page.\n2. Click\n ****Service accounts****\n in the left-hand navigation pane.\n3. Select your project and click\n ****Open****\n .\n4. Click\n ****Create Service Account****\n .\n5. Enter a name and description for the service account.\n6. Click\n ****Create****\n .\n7. Select\n ****Project Owner****\n .\n8. Click\n ****Continue****\n .\n9. Click\n ****Create key****\n .\n10. Select\n ****JSON****\n as the key type.\n11. Click\n ****Create****\n .\n\nA private key will be saved to your computer.\n\n\n To create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\nand log in.\n2. Click\n ****New Client****\n (found under \"My Account\" in the top right corner).\n3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of\n ****Data****\n and\n ****User****\n .\n\n\n When you click\n ****Create****\n , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.\n4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.\n\nConnecting to BigQuery\n------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google BigQuery Unload Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your (third-party tool) account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Service Account Key JSON BigQuery\n  |\n Enter your Google BigQuery JSON service account key.\n  |\n|\n Service Account Key JSON Google Cloud Storage\n  |\n Enter your Google Cloud Storage JSON service account key.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID.\n  |\n|\n Domo\u00a0Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.\n  |\n\nFor information about obtaining these credentials, see \"Prerequsites,\" above.\n\nOnce you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google BigQuery Unload DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Enter Query Manually\n  |\n Lets you manually enter a\u00a0BigQuery SQL query to pull in the desired data.\n  |\n|\n Generate Query\n  |\n Retrieves data based on a selected table.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n DataSet\u00a0ID\n  |\n Select the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy your table data into. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\u00a0datasources/.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\n\n https://mycompany.domo.com/datasourc...tails/overview\n\n\n , the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Table ID\n  |\n Select the ID for the table you want to copy.\n  |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the BigQuery SQL query you want to execute. Only standard SQL syntax is supported.\n  |\n|\n Bucket\n  |\n Select the desired Google Cloud Storage bucket.\n  |\n|\n Dimension Fields (Optional)\n  |\n Enter a comma-separated list of fields that need to be treated as dimensions in Domo.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042928754\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003587\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle BigQuery Unload Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,673\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_bigquery_unload_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
