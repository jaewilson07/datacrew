Intro
-------

When a document or image has been uploaded to Domo, either in a Doc Card or in a Buzz discussion, you can open a preview mode for the file. This preview mode provides all of the following capabilities:

 Standard and full-screen viewing modes
* A page indicator that lets you jump to a specific page in the document (when the document consists of multiple pages)
* Page navigation buttons
* A download icon

You can also open the preview mode for a file
 *before*
 it is saved as a card; that is, when you select a file for a new Doc Card, the preview mode becomes available.


 Opening the file preview mode
-------------------------------

If the file you want to preview has been uploaded to a Doc Card, you can open the preview mode from the card Details page. If the document has been attached to a Buzz post, you can preview the document just by clicking the thumbnail. You can also preview the document after selecting it in the
 **New Document**
 dialog.


**Note:**
 If you attach a file with an unpreviewable file type (e.g. a

.wav

file) to a Buzz post, an image of a generic blue square containing the file extension. appears for the thumbnail and preview. However, you can still download such files in the preview mode. For more information about downloading, see

If the file belongs to an unsupported file type, an error message appears. For a list of supported file types, see

Understanding the document preview mode interface
