To learn more about the\u00a0Meetup API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/meetup\\_api/\n\n).\n\n\n The Meetup connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Meetup account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Meetup connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector helps you facilitate group meetings in various locations and find and join groups.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Events\n* Ratings\n* Followers\n* Engagements\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Public relations\n* Social media reps\n* Recruiting\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 2 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nThis connector works best with the \"Replace\" update method if you are interested in recent data.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Meetup account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address you entered when you signed up for Meetup\n* Your\u00a0Meetup password\n\nAlternatively, you can log into your\u00a0Meetup account\u00a0using your Facebook or Google credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Meetup Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Meetup Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Meetup connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Meetup accounts in Domo)\u00a0to open the\u00a0Meetup OAuth screen where you can enter the email address you entered when you signed up for Meetup, along with your\u00a0Meetup password. You can also connect using Facebook or Google credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Meetup DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0Meetup when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Meetup.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0Meetup report.
