To learn more about Wrike\u00a0BI Export, visit\n\nhttps://help.wrike.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019094414-BI-Export\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Wrike account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Wrike\u00a0Enterprise connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Wrike account and create a DataSet, you must have a Wrike username and password. Alternatively, you can connect using Google or Microsoft Office 365 credentials, or SSO credentials if these have been set up for your company.\n\n\n Connecting to your Wrike account\n----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Wrike\u00a0Enterprise Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials pane\n\nThe Domo Wrike\u00a0Enterprise connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Wrike accounts in Domo) to open the Wrike OAuth screen where you can enter your credentials to connect to Wrike. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Wrike\u00a0Enterprise DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Wrike\u00a0when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Wrike.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a single\n **Report**\n menu which auto-populates with all of the reports available in your Wrike account. No other configuration is needed.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the report you want to extract from your Wrike account.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n Why is my list of reports not populating?\n\nThe first time you click on the\n **Report**\n dropdown, it can take several hours for the reports in the list to generate.\n\n####\n Why isn't the connector working?\n\nThe Wrike Enterprise connector is only enabled for users who have Enterprise-level subscriptions from Wrike and have\u00a0the \"data export\" permission enabled.
