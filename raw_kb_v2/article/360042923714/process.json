In a normal situation, Magic ETL does not have a DOES NOT CONTAIN feature built inside of the tool, so you would have to resort to a more technical query engine like an SQL DataFlow or Beast Mode.\n                       \n\n                        Ideally there should be a relatively simply drag-and-drop tile in Magic ETL that includes DOES NOT CONTAIN or a simple procedure to accomplish the same functionality. Fortunately there are two ways to implement DOES NOT CONTAIN in Magic ETL: a simple but technical way, and a long but non-technical way.\n                       \n\n                        For both of these examples, we assume the client is over a department store that contains several departments. The data is often skewed in the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s departments, so these departments need to be filtered out of the data. The client is not an SQL expert and would like to use Magic ETL to accomplish this task.\n                       \n\n                        The content in this article was shared during our Domopalooza 2017 Tips and Tricks session.
