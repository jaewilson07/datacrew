A risk heat map is a special type of heat map you can use to present the results of a risk assessment process visually Â Whether conducted as part of a broad-based enterprise risk management process or more narrowly focused internal control process, risk assessment is a critical step in risk management. The risk heat map makes this easy to see and discover risk.
