The risk heat map makes this easy to see and discover risk.\n\nPowering Risk Heat Maps\n-------------------------\n\nThe risk heat map requires two categories and one value column. The categories usually represent the severity and likelihood of an event.\n\n\n For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your risk heat map. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n Customizing Risk Heat Maps\n----------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a risk heat map by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . For information about all chart properties, see\n\nChart Properties\n\n.\n\n\n Unique properties of a risk heat map include the following:\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n General > Low Color\n  |\n Sets the color for the low risk area. Default color is green.\n\n\n In the example, the low color is blue.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n General > Medium Color\n  |\n Sets the color for the low risk area. Default color is yellow.\n\n\n In the example, the medium color is orange.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n General > High Color\n  |\n Sets the color for the low risk area. Default color is red.\n\n\n In the example, the high color is purple.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n General > Invert Colors\n  |\n Changes from top-left base to bottom-right base.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n General > Square Cells\n  |\n Keeps all grid cells square even when the table area is skewed.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n General > Inner Margin\n  |\n Margin space used. This is the space between the colored cells.\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 7506837994007\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004658\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nRisk Heat Map\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,887\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:18 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "risk_heat_map", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
