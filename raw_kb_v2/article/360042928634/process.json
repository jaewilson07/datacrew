To learn more about the\n\nDatabase.com\n\nAPI, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.salesforce.com/platform/database/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your\n\nDatabase.com\n\naccount in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\n\nDatabase.com\n\nconnector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\n\nDatabase.com\n\naccount and create a DataSet, you must have credentials for either a Salesforce\n\nDatabase.com\n\nor Sandbox account.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nDatabase.com\n\nAccount\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nDatabase.com\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\n\nDatabase.com\n\nconnector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Select the environment you want to pull data from (either\n **Database.com**\n or\n **Sandbox**\n ) then click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\n\nDatabase.com\n\naccounts in Domo) to open the Salesforce\u00a0OAuth screen where you can enter your Salesforce credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nDatabase.com\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Salesforce when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Salesforce.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains menus for configuring how you want to pull data from Database.com.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n How do you want to select your\n\nDatabase.com\n\ndata?\n  |\n Select how you want to pull data from\n\nDatabase.com\n\n. If you select\n **Browse Objects**\n**and Fields**\n , you specify your data by selecting objects with associated fields and relationships. If you select\n **Query**\n , you enter an SOQL\u00a0query to retrieve data.\n\n\n |\n|\n\nDatabase.com\n\nObjects\n  |\n Select the object (table) containing the data you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Columns\n  |\n Select the names of the columns with data you want to pull into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Relationships\n  |\n Select joinable tables on the selected object.\n  |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the SOQL\u00a0query you want to use to pull data into Domo.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042928634\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003592\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nDatabase.com Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,360\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "databasecom_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
