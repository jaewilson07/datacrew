(You can access the the Windows ODBC Data\u00a0Source Administrator by entering \"ODBC\" in the Start Menu search, then selecting \"Data\u00a0Sources (ODBC)\".)

This variable lets you construct a query that gets only the \"new\" rows each time it runs. For example, if your data has a column with a row \"id\" that increments with each new row, you can construct a query containing\n                               \n\n\n                                 !{lastvalue:id}!\n                                \n\n\n                                similar to the following:\n                               \n\n\n                                 select id, name, type, sales from tablename where id > !{lastvalue:id}! order by id\n                                \n\n\n                                In this example, the column \"id\"\n                                \n                                 must\n                                \n                                be in the\n                                \n                                 SELECT\n                                \n                                ,\n                                \n                                 WHERE\n                                \n                                , and\n                                \n                                 ORDER BY\n                                \n                                clauses for the variable to be used and updated.\n                               \n\n                                When uploading this job, Workbench replaces the\n                               \n\n\n                                 !{lastvalue:id}!\n                                \n\n\n                                variable with the current value of \"id\".
