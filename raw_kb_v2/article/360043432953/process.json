You can use Domo's\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online\u00a0Reports connector to retrieve data about all financial aspects of your business. To learn more about the\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online Reports API, go to\n\nhttps://developer.intuit.com/docs/0050\\_quickbooks\\_api\n\n.\n\n\n The QuickBooks Online Reports connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n To use the\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online Reports\u00a0connector, create a DataSet in the\n\nData Center\n\nand select the\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online Reports\u00a0connector.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online Reports connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You can also pull on-premise QuickBooks Online data using Workbench, a secure, client-side solution for uploading your data in Domo. In addition to QuickBooks, you can use Workbench to upload data from other systems using CSV, JIRA, JSON, Microsoft Excel, ODBC, OLAP, and XML. For more information, see\n\nConnecting to QuickBooks Data in Workbench 5\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Pulling financial accounting reports.\n  |\n| **Primary Metrics**  | * Revenue\n* Costs\n* P&L line items\n* Balance sheet items\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Accountants\n* Purchasers\n* CFOs\n* Controllers\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Report runtime will depend on how large the reports in QuickBooks are.

Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online accounts in Domo) to open the QuickBooks\u00a0Online OAuth screen where you can enter your login credentials.\u00a0After you log in using your credentials, you are requested to authorize Domo to access your QuickBooks Online data. Once you enter credentials and authorize Domo,\u00a0you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online Reports DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nCreating and Managing User Groups\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of\u00a0QuickBooks Online.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary menu from which you select a report, along with various other menus that may or may not appear depending on the selected report.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0QuickBooks\u00a0Online report.

However, the connector retrieves the reports from Quickbooks exactly as they appear. If you change a report for an ad-hoc analysis inside Quickbooks, that change is reflected in the report. A good solution to this problem is to use\u00a0a system user that has standard reports in Quickbooks.\n\n\n A few users have reported having their Quickbooks Online accounts become unauthorized. If this happens, manually disconnect Domo in the Quickbooks website then reconnect to QuickBooks through Domo by adding the account again.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043432953\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003618\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nQuickBooks Online Reports Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,840\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "quickbooks_online_reports_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
