This chart type is almost identical to a\n                        \n                         pie chart\n                        \n                        ; the only difference is that there is a hole in the center, so the sections appear as arcs rather than wedges.\n                       \n\n                        Donut charts contain a single subtype: the nautilus donut chart.
