Intro
-------

Domo's Facebook Advanced connector can combine Facebook insights with data from any other source—finance analytics, CRM software, etc.—to target campaigns with unparalleled precision. Use this connector to retrieve data about posts, page fans, referrals, account information, and the like. To learn more about the Facebook API, visit their page (

https://developers.facebook.com

).


 This Advanced version of the connector includes more report types and configuration parameters. It also allows you to retrieve more than 30 days worth of Facebook data. To learn about the simplified version of the connector, see

Facebook Connector

.


 You connect to your Facebook account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Facebook Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Facebook account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Facebook username or your telephone number
* Your Facebook password

Connecting to Your Facebook Account
-------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Facebook Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Facebook Advanced connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Facebook Advanced accounts in Domo) to open the Facebook OAuth screen where you can enter your Facebook credentials. Once you have entered valid Facebook credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Facebook Advanced DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Facebook when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Facebook.


###
 Details Pane

This pane contains a primary
 **Reports**
 menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.

#####
 What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?

You need the email address and password associated with your Facebook account.

####
 How do I know my Facebook credentials are secure?

The login process uses the OAuth process, so your credentials are never seen or stored by Domo. This keeps your login secure. You can revoke Domo's access to your account at any time.

####
 Do I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?

Any Facebook account can be used to set up the connector. However, many of the reports are designed to return data and statistics about pages. You must be an administrator of the page(s) that you want to retrieve this data for.

####
 Can I get information about pages I am not an administrator of?

Yes. There are reports that allow you to retrieve public information about pages that you are not an administrator for. To use these reports, you will need to know the pages' names. For example, if the URL of a page is "

www.facebook.com/DomoHQ"

", then you would enter "DomoHQ" as the page name.

####
 What is the difference between the Facebook and Facebook Advanced connectors?

The Facebook Advanced connector provides more reports than the Facebook connector. The Facebook connector's reports are limited to deal directly with pages. Reports about the user, domains, application monitoring and public page information are in the Advanced connector.


 The Facebook connector is also limited to return information about the last 30 days, while the Advanced connector allows the user to query data for any date range.

####
 How frequently will my data update?

Most information about pages is updated every 24 hours. A small number of insight metrics are updated roughly every 15 minutes. It is recommended that DataSets usually be configured to run every 24 hours.

####
 Why are the dates in Facebook's Insights UI and the dates in Domo sometimes different?

Often people validate their DataSets by comparing the results of the connector to the statistics they can see in Facebook's Insights UI. When they are doing so, the dates are generally off by 1 day. For example, if the Facebook UI shows 1000 views for a page on March 3, the connector will report 1000 views with a date timestamp of March 4. This is because the API returns data for a time period that ends at the timestamp specified. In this example, there were 1000 views during the day that ended at Midnight on March 4, in other words, March 3. The Insights UI takes this into account and reports the 1000 views as having happened on March 3.

####
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

Facebook limits the number of calls that can be made each hour for each user and page. As long as you don't run the DataSet too often, the connector manages this for you.


 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the time frame that you are trying to pull.
* Be aware that when comparing page statistics in your Facebook Advanced DataSet to those found in Facebook’s Insights UI, the dates are generally off by 1 day. For example, if the Facebook UI shows 1000 views for a page on March 3, the connector will report 1000 views with a date timestamp of March 4. This is because the API returns data for a time period that
 *ends*
 at the timestamp specified. In this example, there were 1000 views during the day that ended at midnight on March 4—in other words, March 3. The Insights UI takes this into account, and reports the 1000 views as having happened on March 3.
