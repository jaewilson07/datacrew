Here you can customize the message for the Alert using a variety of different macros to indicate available metrics.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Share this Alert\n                          \n                          .

You can also set the frequency at which Domo\u00a0checks to see if the Alert has triggered.\n                       \n\n                        If PDP policies have been set on the DataSet for the Card, you can specify how PDP\u00a0is applied to Alerts in Step 1 of the wizard.

It could also be a calculation applied to a specific category or series. For example, you could apply an \"Average\" calculation to a given category, then configure your Alert to trigger whenever that value fell below a specified threshold. Domo provides a number of such calculations, from simple arithmetic operations like \"Sum of\" to advanced statistical operations such as \"Skewness of\" and \"Kurtosis of.\"\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A conditional statement that connects the measure to the value or percentage and determines when your Alert is sent.\u00a0Domo provides a variety of condition statements to choose from, including greater than, less than, and equal statements and combinations of these. You can also specify a particular degree of change using the\n                          \n                           changes by\n                          \n                          ,\n                          \n                           increases by\n                          \n                          , and\n                          \n                           decreases by\n                          \n                          condition statements.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The numerical value or percentage used as the threshold in your Alert.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can build an Alert by specifying these components in the three fields in Step 1 (\"Rule\") of the Alert wizard.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        In the preceding screenshot, the user has selected\n                        \n                         Poor Customer Service\u00a0(Most recent month)\n                        \n                        as the measure and\n                        \n                         Increases by (+ %)\n                        \n                        as the conditional statement, and has entered\n                        \n                         5\n                        \n                        as the numerical value.

When this box is checked, instead of sending out a single Notification as soon as the Alert enters a triggered state (which is the default functionality), Domo\u00a0sends out Notifications based on the selected frequency\n                        \n                         until the Alert conditions are no longer met\n                        \n                        . For example, let's\u00a0user Gus creates the Alert rule \"Summary number is greater than 500,\" selects\n                        \n                         Weekly\n                        \n                        as the frequency, then checks this box. As soon as the summary number surpasses 500, a Notification is sent. Then, as long as the summary number remains above 500, new Notifications are sent on the specified weekday at the specified time. If the number drops below 500, Notifications will stop being sent. If, on the other hand, Gus doesn't check this box, only an initial Notification is sent when the Alert is triggered.\n                       \n\n                        The\n                        \n                         Keep sending Notifications while in a triggered state\n                        \n                        checkbox appears only for threshold-based Alerts, as opposed to those one-time Alerts that trigger when a certain degree of change is met. For example, for an \"Is greater than\" Alert (e.g. an Alert that triggers when its value surpasses 1000), this box would be available because the Alert still applies as long as the value remains above the threshold. But for a \"Changes by\"\u00a0Alert, the box is not available because once the given value is reached, only a single Notification needs be sent\u2014the Alert's work is then done.\n                       \n\n                        Determining whether to honor Filters\n                       \n\n                        If filters have been set on this Card on either the Page or Card level, an option appears allowing you to toggle whether those filters are honored in the Alert. If you uncheck the box, the Alert will be applied to the unfiltered version of the Card. You can click the\n                        \n                         Show filters\n                        \n                        option to see the currently applied filters.\n                       \n\n                        Customizing your Alert message\n                       \n\n                        In Step 2 of the wizard, you can customize the Notification message that is sent whenever the Alert is triggered. You can choose from a wide variety of macros to include in the message. Macros are used to reference different variables related to your Alert, such as Alert name, previous or current value, Alert owner, change in Alert value, and so on. For example, in the default Notification message that appears when you enter Step 2, macros are used to indicate the Alert rule as configured in Step 1 of the wizard, the name of the Card in which the Alert is found, the previous Alert value, and the current Alert value.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In the left panel of the wizard, under \"Message,\" you can see the Notification message with the variables switched in for the macros. So for the default Notification message shown above, this message might read as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        In this example, [Full rule] has been replaced by \"Sum of 1-Very Dissatisfied is greater than or equal to 50\"; [Card Name] has been replaced by \"Customer Satisfaction\"; [Previous Alert value] has been replaced by \"empty\" (because there is no previous value for this Alert);\u00a0and [Current Alert value] has been replaced by \"653.\"\n                       \n\n                        You can see a list of macros by clicking the\n                        \n                         Metric\n                        \n                        button above the template. For each macro, the list shows you the name of the corresponding variable in your Alert so you know if you are pulling over the right information.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        If you edit the custom message then decide you want to revert it back to the default, you can do so by clicking the\n                        \n                        in the top right corner of the Alert message field.\n                       \n\n                        Attaching an action\n                       \n\n                        Alert Actions drive powerful action for your business by triggering events such as Webhook integration with third-party systems and Projects & Tasks integrations in Domo.
