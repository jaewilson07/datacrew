You can use Domo's CDK Global\n\n\n Connector to pull data from your CDK Global\n\n\n database and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting an SQL query.\n\n\n The CDK Global\n\n\n connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n\n\n**Database**\n\n\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n*Notes:**\n\n\n* This connector supports TLS IF your CDK Global server supports TLS.\n* Non SSL connections are not supported. If no certificate is provided, the connection is still SSL but without any certificate authentication. The connection will trust all server certificates. Refer to the following\u00a0link for details :\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb879949%28v=sql.110%29.aspx\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Limit the results set size is much as possible.\n* Keep the number of columns to a minimum.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a CDK Global database and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your CDK Global\n\n\n database.\n* The hostname for the database.\n* The port number for the database.\n* The database name or schema name.\n* The SQL query you will use to pull data.\n* SSL.\n\nYou can also include the URL where your SSL CA Certificate is located, though this is optional.\n\n\n Connecting to Your CDK Global\n\n\n Database\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes on the CDK Global\n\n\n Connector page. The components of the other panes on this page,\n **Scheduling,**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n When using the copy/paste function for your credentials, ensure there is no whitespace at the beginning or end of the string. By accidentally pasting whitespace, it will cause the connector to error when trying to connect.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the SFTP host name for the CDK Global\n\n\n database. For example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n\n |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the CDK Global database or schema.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your CDK Global username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your CDK Global\n\n\n password.\n  |\n|\n CA Certificate\n  |\n Enter the URL where the SSL Ca Certificate is located (optional).\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the database.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid CDK Global\n\n\n credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new CDK Global\n\n\n DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to pull data from your database, with or without a parameter.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query Type\n  |\n Select the desired CDK Global\n\n\n query type\u2014either with or without a parameter.\n  |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the Structured Query Language (SQL) query to use in selecting the data you want. For example:\n\nselect \\* from Employee\n\nYou can use the\n **Query Helper**\n parameter to help you write a usable SQL query. To use the\n **Query Helper**\n , do the following:\n 1. Select your database table\u00a0and table columns in the appropriate menus.\n2. Copy the SQL statement that appears in the\n **Query Helper**\n field.\n3. Paste the copied SQL statement into the\n **Query**\n field.\n\n\n |\n|\n Query Parameter\n  |\n Enter the query parameter value. This is the initial value for the query parameter. You can use this option to retrieve new data since the last run.\n\n\n For example, if you entered the following query in the\n **Query**\n field...\n\n\n`select * from test.lastValue where id <= !{lastvalue:id}! order by id desc`\n\n\n ...and then entered the following for the\n **Query Parameter**\n ...\n\n\n`!{lastvalue:id}!=3`\n\n\n ...then the first run would return 3 rows, and all subsequent runs would return 1 row, and the results would be ordered from largest to smallest.\n\n\n Similarly, if you entered the following in the\n\n\n**Query**\n field...\n\n\n`select * from test.lastValue where time > !{lastrundate:time}!`\n\n\n ...and then entered the following for the\n **Query Parameter**\n ...\n\n\n`!{lastrundate:time}!=01/01/1990`\n\n\n ...then the first run would return 5 rows and all subsequent runs would return 0 rows.\n  |\n|\n TinyInt Values Treated as Boolean Values?\n  |\n Select\n **Yes**\n if you want TinyInt\u00a0values to be treated as Boolean.\n  |\n|\n Cast Boolean Values To...\n  |\n Select whether Boolean values will be cast to integers or strings.\n  |\n|\n Database Tables (Optional)\n  |\n Select the database table you want to import into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Table Columns (Optional)\n  |\n Select the table columns you want to import into Domo.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper (Optional)\n  |\n Copy and paste the SQL statement in this field into the\n **Query**\n field. For more information, see\n **Query**\n , above.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the username and password associated with your CDK Global account. You also need your CDK Global SFTP hostname and port number.\n\n####\n Can I use the same account multiple times to create datasets?\n\nYes\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Verify the credentials using MySQL Workbench.\n* Confirm the server supports encrypted connections.\n* Confirm the Domo IPs are whitelisted.\n* To speed up your runtime, make sure the tables you are joining don't have duplicate column names and that you call each column only once.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 9133993462167\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003825\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCDK Global Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,383\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "cdk_global_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
