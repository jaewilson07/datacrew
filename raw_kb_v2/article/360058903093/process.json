You can use Domo's Google BigQuery\u00a0Enterprise Data connector to pull data from a specified project and get interactive analysis of massive datasets. Google BigQuery queries are written using a variation of the standard SQL SELECT statement.\u00a0To learn more about the Google API, visit\n\n\n https://developer.google.com\n\n\n .\n\n\n You connect to your Google BigQuery Enterprise Data account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google BigQuery Enterprise Data connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Google BigQuery Enterprise account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A project created in the Google Developers Console with the APIs and Services enabled\n* The Client ID and Client Secret associated with your Google Developers\u00a0account\n\nThe following steps explain in detail how to create your project and obtain the needed credentials.\n\n###\n**Creating\u00a0a project in the Google Developers Console**\n\n\n1. Go to\n\nhttps://console.developers.google.com\n\n.\n2. Click the dropdown arrow next to\n **My Project**\n .\n3. Click\n **New Project**\n .\n4. Name your project and select the parent folder.\n5. Click\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n You can also use an existing project if you want.\n\n\n####\n**Creating the OAuth\u00a0Client ID and Client Secret**\n\n1. Login to\n\nhttps://console.developers.google.com/\n\n.\n\n\n 2.\u00a0Select your\u00a0project.\n\n\n 3.\u00a0Go to\n **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n .\n\n4.\u00a0Click on\n **+Create credentials > OAuth client ID**\n .\n\n5. Select\n **OAuth client ID**\n .\n\n\n 6. Select the\n **Application Type**\n as\n **Web application**\n from the drop down.\n\n7.\u00a0Enter the name for your application.\n\n\n 8. Click on\n ****+Add URI****\n under\n ****Authorized redirect URIs****\n .\n\n\n 9. Add\n **https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/google-bigquery-enterprise/exchange**\n as\u00a0the redirect\u00a0 URI.\n\n10. Click\n ****Create****\n .\n\n###\n****Enabling API and Services****\n\n1. Login to\n\nhttps://console.developers.google.com/\n\n.\n\n\n 2.\u00a0Go to\n ****APIs & Services > Dashboard****\n .\n\n\n 3.\u00a0Click\n ****+ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES****\n .\n\n4.\u00a0Search for\n **Google BigQuey API**\n .\n\n5. Click the\n **ENABLE**\n button to enable the BigQuery API.\n\nConnecting to Your Google BigQuery Enterprise Account\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nGoogle BigQuery Enterprise\u00a0Data\n\nConnector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nGoogle BigQuery Enterprise\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter the Client ID\u00a0associated with your Google Developers\u00a0account. For more details, see\n\nPrerequisites\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter the Client Secret associated with your Google Developers\u00a0account. For more details, see\n\nPrerequisites\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google BigQuery\u00a0Enterprise\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Google BigQuery Enterprise report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Returns the data from Big Query by running legacy or standard SQL.\n  |\n|\n Table Information\n  |\n Returns the information of the Table.\n  |\n|\n Table Data\n  |\n Returns the information about the Table data.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n What Query Type would you like to use?\n  |\n Select whether you would like to use a Legacy\u00a0SQL Query or a Standard SQL Query. By default, LegacySQL is selected.\n  |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter a fully qualified Google BigQuery query.\n  |\n|\n Query Parameter\n  |\n Enter the query parameter value. It is the initial value for query parameter. The last run date is optional by default. The value for last run date is '02/01/1700' if it is not provided. Example:\n\n!{lastvalue:\\_id}!=1,!{lastrundate:start\\_date}!=02/01/1944\n  |\n|\n Project ID\n  |\n Enter the ID for the project you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Expect Large Results\n  |\n Specify whether you would\u00a0like to get large results. Queries with large results will create a temporary table and delete it when the job is finished. A dataset ID is required to create the temporary table.\n  |\n|\n Dataset ID\n  |\n Enter the ID for the dataset you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Projects\n  |\n Select project from available list of projects.\n  |\n|\n Datasets\n  |\n Select dataset from available list of datasets.\n  |\n|\n Tables\n  |\n Select table from available list of tables.\n  |\n|\n Location\n  |\n Enter location. Visit\n\nDataset Locations\n\nto find more information about\u00a0Location.\n  |\n|\n Selected Fields\n  |\n Select fields.\n  |\n|\n Max Results\n  |\n Max Results is the number of results returned per page of data. By default, it returns 10,000 results per page. If your dataset throws an out of memory error, decrease Max Results.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360058903093\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003864\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle BigQuery Enterprise Data Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,734\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_bigquery_enterprise_data_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
