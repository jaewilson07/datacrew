To learn more about the Stripe API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://stripe.com/docs/api\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Stripe account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Stripe connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Stripe account and create a DataSet, you must have a Stripe API key. You can find API keys in your\n\nStripe Account Settings\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Stripe Account\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Stripe Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Stripe account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n Enter your Stripe API key. You can find API keys in your\n\nStripe Account Settings\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Stripe credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Stripe DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a menu from which you can select a Stripe report/\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Stripe report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Description\n  |\n Returns properties for your account.\n  |\n|\n Application Fees\n  |\n Returns a list of application fees you've previously collected.\n  |\n|\n Balance\n  |\n Returns the current account balance.\n  |\n|\n Balance History\n  |\n Returns a list of transactions that have contributed to your Stripe account balance (e.g., charges, transfers, etc.).\n  |\n|\n Charges\n  |\n Returns a list of charges you've created. Stripe sends this as \"Zero-Decimal-Currency,\" meaning no decimals appear in the values.
