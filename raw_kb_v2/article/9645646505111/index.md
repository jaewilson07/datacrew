###
 Community Built Connectors

Community Built Connectors enable Connector builders to create, update, and support Connectors in Domo. If a Connector has been published as Community Built, the code is available to all customers in the Appstore. Any Domo user with access to the Appstore and Connectors can copy code to the IDE to create a Connector from a Community Built Connector.

####
 Dashboards: "Go to Card details" Interaction

With the new "Go to Card details" interaction option for Dashboards, you can prioritize a larger view of certain cards or data apps that are configured to always use the full screen. The mobile experience can now be configured independently from the desktop so that the web experience is unaffected.

####
 Finance App Updates

In the Domo Finance App, you can now show the most recent data on the left, instead of requiring users to scroll all the way to the right to see the most recent data.


 The column name "Ratio" is now "% of [column]". This allows users to more easily see what the ratio is calculating against based on the app's configuration.


**Default Views**


 With Default Views, Admins can expand different sections, set up filters and date ranges, and save that view as the default each time a user opens the app.


**Nonstandard Calendars**


 With Nonstandard Calendars, you can toggle "Numerical Periods," which replaces month names with period numbers, allowing for any variants of non-standard calendars, and for users to configure those periods using ETL. This feature also allows calculated trends in the DataSet, permitting you to view average trends, rather than sum trends.

###
 Product Feedback Process

You can now communicate feedback more clearly in the Dojo's Ideas Exchange by adding multimedia. You can see whether another user has already submitted the same feedback. Domo's Product Team can respond directly to the feedback. The new process also allows other Domo users to view your feedback, provide insights, and upvote good ideas. This community collaboration helps drive Domo's development roadmap.


 To access the feature, go to the Domo navigation header: select
 **More**
 >
 **Feedback**
 . In the modal that displays, choose
 **Product feedback**
 .


 New Chart Types
-----------------

Find these new chart types in the chart picker in Analyzer:

###
 Bump Chart

With Bump Charts, you can quickly see changes in rank over time. The change in rank is emphasized rather than the numeric changes in values.

####
 Risk Heat Map

With Risk Heat Maps, you can evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks and then view the risks displayed in a fixed color grid.


 For more information, see

Risk Heat Map

####
 Faceted Bar Chart

With the additional dimensions available with Faceted Bar Charts, you can combine many charts to create one, saving space by not replicating the X-axis.
