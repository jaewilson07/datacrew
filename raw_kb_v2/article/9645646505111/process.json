You can access FIXED Functions alongside other available functions in the Beast Mode Editor. FIXED Functions are only available for non-federated DataSets.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nBeast Mode FIXED Functions\n\n.\n\n###\n Community Built Connectors\n\nCommunity Built Connectors enable Connector builders to create, update, and support Connectors in Domo. If a Connector has been published as Community Built, the code is available to all customers in the Appstore. Any Domo user with access to the Appstore and Connectors can copy code to the IDE to create a Connector from a Community Built Connector.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nCommunity Built Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Dashboards: \"Go to Card details\" Interaction\n\nWith the new \"Go to Card details\" interaction option for Dashboards, you can prioritize a larger view of certain cards or data apps that are configured to always use the full screen. The mobile experience can now be configured independently from the desktop so that the web experience is unaffected.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nEdit the Mobile Layout\n\n.\n\n###\n New DDX Bricks\n\nNew DDX bricks allow you to build your custom solutions quickly. Find these new DDX Bricks in the Appstore.\n\n DDX D3 Venn Diagram\n* DDX Filtered Single Image\n* DDX Form and DataSet\n* DDX HTML Table Header\n* DDX HTML Table with Nested Charts\n* DDX Ten DataSets\n* DDX Top 10 Images\n* DDX Phoenix Cumulative Percentile\n* DDX Phoenix Gradient Single Bar\n* DDX Phoenix Percentile\n\nFor more information, see\n\nDDX Bricks\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Finance App Updates\n\nIn the Domo Finance App, you can now show the most recent data on the left, instead of requiring users to scroll all the way to the right to see the most recent data.\n\n\n The column name \"Ratio\" is now \"% of [column]\". This allows users to more easily see what the ratio is calculating against based on the app's configuration.\n\n\n**Default Views**\n\n\n With Default Views, Admins can expand different sections, set up filters and date ranges, and save that view as the default each time a user opens the app.\n\n\n**Nonstandard Calendars**\n\n\n With Nonstandard Calendars, you can toggle \"Numerical Periods,\" which replaces month names with period numbers, allowing for any variants of non-standard calendars, and for users to configure those periods using ETL. This feature also allows calculated trends in the DataSet, permitting you to view average trends, rather than sum trends.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nDomo Finance\n\n.\n\n###\n Product Feedback Process\n\nYou can now communicate feedback more clearly in the Dojo's Ideas Exchange by adding multimedia. You can see whether another user has already submitted the same feedback. Domo's Product Team can respond directly to the feedback. The new process also allows other Domo users to view your feedback, provide insights, and upvote good ideas. This community collaboration helps drive Domo's development roadmap.\n\n\n To access the feature, go to the Domo navigation header: select\n **More**\n >\n **Feedback**\n .

The change in rank is emphasized rather than the numeric changes in values.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nBump Chart\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Risk Heat Map\n\nWith Risk Heat Maps, you can evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks and then view the risks displayed in a fixed color grid.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nRisk Heat Map\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Faceted Bar Chart\n\nWith the additional dimensions available with Faceted Bar Charts, you can combine many charts to create one, saving space by not replicating the X-axis.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nFaceted Bar Chart\n\n.\n\nBeta Features\n---------------\n\nIf you are interested in joining the Beta for a specific feature, please reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager (CSM), Technical Consultant (TC), or Account Executive (AE).
