Domo provides connectors that allow you to pull data from a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection and compile custom reports.\n\n The MongoDB connector\u00a0uses Java driver version 3.2.1,\u00a0and\u00a0supports Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB connector.\n* The MongoDB Advanced connector uses Java driver version 3.2.1, and\u00a0supports a plain JSON query. You need to enter the Collection name manually in the MongoDB\u00a0Advanced connector.\n* The MongoDB V2 connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB V2 connector. Also, MongoDB V2 connector doesn\u2019t require a CA certificate.\n* The\u00a0MongoDB SSH Connector uses Java driver version 3.12.1, and supports\u00a0Find and Aggregate query methods.\u00a0You can either select the Collection name from the drop down or enter it manually in the MongoDB SSH connector. You need your SSH credentials (host, port, username, and password)\u00a0to pull data from a MongoDB collection\u00a0through an SSH tunnel.\n\nThis article discusses the\n **MongoDB\u00a0Connector**\n . You can use Domo's MongoDB Connector to pull data from a MongoDB collection and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting JSON queries. For more information about the MongoDB API, go to\n\nhttp://api.mongodb.org/\n\n.\n\n\n The MongoDB connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n **Database**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0MongoDB connector user interface.\u00a0For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Important:**\n An SSL connection is required for this connector to work.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a\u00a0MongoDB collection and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your\u00a0MongoDB database\n* The host name for the database server (e.g.\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n\n ).\n* The port number for the database\n* The authentication database name\n* The name of the collection you want to connect to\n* The CA certificate text or URL path is required\n *only*\n if you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n or\n\n*URL Path**\n ,\n\nrespectively, in the\n **Certificate\u00a0Format**\n menu.\n* An SSL connection\n\n\n**Note:**\n MongoDB uses \"admin\" as the database name to establish a connection.\n\nBefore you can connect to a MongoDB\u00a0database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to\u00a0a\u00a0MongoDB Collection\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to a collection within a MongoDB database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the MongoDB database. For example:\n\n\n db.company.com\n\n\n |\n|\n Database Name\n  |\n\nEnter the name of the MongoDB authentication database. This needs to be the specific database the user was created in.\n\n|\n|\n Collection\n  |\n Enter the name of the collection you want to connect to.\n\n*Note:**\n A collection belonging to a database different than the authentication database can be accessed using\n **databaseName.collectionName**\n syntax.\n\n|\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB password.\n  |\n|\n Database Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the MongoDB database.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Format\n  |\n Select\u00a0the certificate format. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n **No Certificate**\n . If you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n , you must paste the text for your certificate in the\n **Certificate**\n field. If you select\n **URL Path**\n , you must enter the URL where your certificate is located in the\n **Certificate**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.\u00a0This is optional. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n **No Certificate**\n in the\n **Certificate\u00a0Format**\n menu.\n  |\n\nAfter you have entered valid\u00a0MongoDB credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a MongoDB DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n*Accounts**\n\ntab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create a JSON query to pull data from your MongoDB collection. You can also create optional\n\nWHERE\n\n,\n\nSELECT\n\n,\n\nGROUP\n\n, and\n\nSORT\n\nclauses, also in JSON format.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n JSON Query\n  |\n Enter the\u00a0JSON query to use in selecting the data you want. Two query methods are available,\n\nFind\n\nand\n\nAggregate\n\n.\n\n\n As an example, let's suppose you have a collection\u00a0with the following data:\n\n\n`{ \"_id\" : 1, \"subject\" : \"History\", \"score\" : 88 },\n\n{ \"_id\" : 2, \"subject\" : \"History\", \"score\" : 92 },\n\n{ \"_id\" : 3, \"subject\" : \"History\", \"score\" : 97 },\n\n{ \"_id\" : 4, \"subject\" : \"History\", \"score\" : 71 },\n\n{ \"_id\" : 5, \"subject\" : \"History\", \"score\" : 79 },\n\n{ \"_id\" : 6, \"subject\" : \"History\", \"score\" : 83 }`\n\n*Find:**\n You could use the\n\nFind\n\nmethod to select from this collection all documents where the subject equals \"History.\" The query would be formatted as follows:\n\n\n`{ subject: \"History\" }`\n\n\n**Aggregate:**\n To use the\n\nAggregate\n\nmethod, your query will look something like the following:\n\n\n`[\n\n{\n\n$match: {\n\nscore: {\n\n$gt: 80\n\n}\n\n}\n\n},\n\n{\n\n$count: \"passing_scores\"\n\n}\n\n]`\n\nIn this example,\u00a0the\n\n$match\n\nstage excludes documents that have a score value of less than or equal to 80 to pass along the documents with a score greater than 80 to the next stage.\u00a0The\n\n$count\n\nstage returns a count of the remaining documents in the aggregation pipeline and assigns the value to a field called \"passing scores.\"\n  |\n|\n Where Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nWHERE\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Select Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nSELECT\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Group Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nGROUP\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Sort Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\n\nSORT\n\nclause in JSON format.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042931734\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003898\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMongoDB Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,097\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:16 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mongodb_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "database_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaojGAC"}]}
