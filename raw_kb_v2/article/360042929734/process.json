In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Foursquare account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Foursquare connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to find out what your friends are doing, learn about new places, and check on mayorships and venues.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n Engagements\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Social media reps\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n ~1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nThis connector works best when the update mode is set to \"Replace.\"\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Foursquare account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address or phone number you entered when you signed up for Foursquare\n* Your\u00a0Foursquare password\n\nAlternatively, you can log into your Foursquare account\u00a0using your Facebook credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Foursquare Account\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Foursquare Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Foursquare connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Foursquare accounts in Domo) to open the\u00a0Foursquare OAuth screen where you can enter the email address or phone number you entered when you signed up for Foursquare, along with your Foursquare password. You can also connect using Facebook credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Foursquare DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into\u00a0Foursquare when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click Add account. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Foursquare.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a Foursquare report.

Note that a single run of a DataSet may require making multiple requests. Domo as a whole may make up to 100,000 requests per day.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nIf the connector returns an error, make sure to read the error description as well as\u00a0check the authentication and report configuration.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042929734\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003483\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nFoursquare Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,643\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "foursquare_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
