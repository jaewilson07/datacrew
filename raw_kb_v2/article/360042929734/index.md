Foursquare is a local search and discovery


 service mobile app which provides a personalized local search experience for its users.  To learn more about the Foursquare API, visit their page (

https://developer.foursquare.com/

).


 The Foursquare connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Foursquare account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Foursquare connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Best Practices
----------------

This connector works best when the update mode is set to "Replace."


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Foursquare account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The email address or phone number you entered when you signed up for Foursquare
* Your Foursquare password

Alternatively, you can log into your Foursquare account using your Facebook credentials.


 Connecting to Your Foursquare Account
---------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Foursquare Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Foursquare connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Foursquare accounts in Domo) to open the Foursquare OAuth screen where you can enter the email address or phone number you entered when you signed up for Foursquare, along with your Foursquare password. You can also connect using Facebook credentials. Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Foursquare DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Foursquare when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click Add account. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Foursquare.

FAQs
------


####
 Do I need a certain kind of account with the data service to set up the connector?

No. A standard FourSquare account is all this required to power up the connector.

###
 How often can the data be updated?

DataSets should be set to update once a day.

###
 Are there any API limits I should be aware of?

Each authenticated user may make up to 500 requests per hour. Note that a single run of a DataSet may require making multiple requests. Domo as a whole may make up to 100,000 requests per day.


 Troubleshooting
-----------------

If the connector returns an error, make sure to read the error description as well as check the authentication and report configuration.
