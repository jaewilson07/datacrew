You can add NLQ Bots to any conversation in Buzz. You can then ask these Bots a question in Buzz using natural language and get an immediate response based on your DataSet data.\n                       \n\n                        Many\u00a0NLQ Bots\u00a0in Domo\u00a0use webhooks,\u00a0meaning you set up an integration with a third-party system. That system then pushes notifications to the Domo conversation where the Bot has been set up.\n                       \n\n                        Because all Bots are set up differently depending on the third-party connector, the instructions provided in this topic are general for all Bots. More specific instructions for each Bot are available when you go to add a Bot in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        Adding an NLQ Bot\n                       \n\n

in this conversation.\n                       \n\n                        Understanding NLQ\n                       \n\n                        For all Bots, you configure NLQ\u00a0(Natural Language Query) by entering a command name in the\n                        \n                         Command Name\n                        \n                        field.\u00a0For many Bots, this field does not appear\u00a0until you configure the webhook\u00a0for the Bot.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        You can enter any name in this field that you want, though it is recommended you choose something related to this connector that is short and easy to remember. Once you have configured the Bot and added a command name, you can invoke the Bot in Buzz by entering\n                        \n                         /[commandname]\n                        \n                        then asking your question.\n                       \n\n                        For example, let's say you have Shopify data in Domo and you want to find out how many refunds you gave during the month of March. You would first configure the Bot as explained above, being sure to enter a command in the\n                        \n                         Command Name\n                        \n                        field. In this example, we'll just use the name \"shopify.\" After successfully connecting to your Shopify store and adding the Bot, you would then write a Buzz message as follows:\n                       \n\n\n                         /shopify\u00a0how many refunds for March\n                        \n\n\n                        Buzz would immediately respond with the answer to your question.\n                       \n\n                        Because NLQ Bots understand natural language, there is no required syntax for your questions. You could rephrase the above query using any of the following structures,\u00a0and because the keywords (\"refunds\" and \"march\") are always present, the reply would be the same:\n                       \n\n\n                         /shopify\u00a0how many refunds did I give in March\n                        \n\n\n\n                         /shopify\u00a0refunds for March\n                        \n\n\n\n                         /shopify March refunds", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360043430273", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
