You can quickly filter the logs using any of four commonly used Quick Filters. Or, if you want to dig deeper into the logs to single out a specific log or pinpoint a small range of logs, you can create customized\u00a0combinations of filters. You can also refresh the logs appearing in the tab\u00a0or export the logs as a CSV file.\n\n\n You can only view activity logs if you have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"View Activity Logs\" enabled.\u00a0For more information about default roles, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\nThis article provides information about viewing Activity Logs in the following topics:\n\n Filtering the logs\n* Refreshing the logs\n* Exporting to CSV\n* Tracked events\n\nFiltering the Logs\n----------------------\n\nThere are dozens of filter options available in the\n **Activity Logs**\n screen; fortunately you can apply the most commonly used filters with one\u00a0click of your\u00a0mouse. These \"quick filters\" are found in\u00a0the top right of the\n **Activity Logs**\n screen and are as follows:\n\n\n Filter\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Cards Created\n  |\n All\u00a0cards created by users in this instance in the past week, together with the time of creation, the user, the name of the card, and the description of the action.\n  |\n|\n Logins\n  |\n All logins by users in this instance in the past week, together with the time of login, the user, and his/her IP address and device name.\n  |\n|\n Card Views\n  |\n All card views by users in this instance in the past week, together with the time of viewing, the user, the name of the card, and the description of the action.\n  |\n|\n Page Views\n  |\n All page views by users in this instance in the past week, together with the time of viewing, the user, the page name, and the description of the action.\n  |\n\nYou can also set custom filters. These can be used singly or in combinations with each other or with\u00a0the quick filters described above. These custom filters appear as buttons above the log lists and are as follows:\n\n\n Filter\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Time\n  |\n Lets you filter data using\u00a0three predefined time filters (past 24 hours, past 7 days, or past 180 days) or set a custom date and time range.\n  |\n|\n Person\n  |\n Lets you filter data for a specified user in your Domo instance.\n  |\n|\n Event\n  |\n Lets you filter data for a selected Domo\u00a0event. These are organized by Domo component; click any component in the list to drill down to events associated with that component. For instance, if you were to click\n **Card**\n in the list, a menu of selectable card-related events would open, such as\n **Added**\n ,\n **Favorited**\n , etc. Selecting an event would then filter the data to show only rows for that event.\n  |\n|\n Object\n  |\n Lets you filter data for a selected Domo object. These are organized by Domo component; click any component in the list to drill down to objects associated with that component. For instance, if you were to click\n **PDP Policy**\n in the list, a menu of selectable PDP policies would open. Selecting a policy would then filter the data to show only rows for that policy.\n  |\n\nRefreshing the Logs\n-----------------------\n\nYou can refresh the logs in the\n **User Logs**\n tab by clicking\u00a0the\n **Refresh**\n button in the top right corner of the tab.\u00a0When you do this, any new logs since you opened the tab appear.\n\n\n Exporting to CSV\n--------------------\n\nYou can export all of the logs in your Domo instance to a CSV file by clicking the\n **Export CSV**\n button in the top right corner of the tab. This download process may take a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the number of logs in your instance.\n\n\n Tracked Events\n------------------\n\n\n**Note:**\n If images on pages (including background images) are stored through the API, \"Downloaded a file version\" will appear under the Event category.\n\nThis section provides a list of all Domo objects\u00a0and their associated actions that are tracked in the activity logs.\n\n\n Domo Object\n  |\n Action(s) Tracked\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Access Token\n  | * Assigned\n* Created\n* Deleted\n* Unassigned\n |\n|\n
