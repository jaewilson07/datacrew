From user-centric product design to deep support resources, Seismic\u2019s platform solution is designed from the ground to help clients get results, fast. Use Domo's Seismic Direct Sign-On connector to combine Seismic data with other key sales and marketing data, and get a real-time view of your data for your entire team. To learn more about Seismic API, visit\n\n\n https://developer.seismic.com/seismicsoftware/reference\n\n.\n\nYou connect to your Seismic account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Seismic Direct Sign-On connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Seismic account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Seismic tenant\n* Your Seismic client ID and client secret\n* Your Seismic username and password\n\nfor direct sign-on\n\nTo obtain your Seismic tenant, contact your Domo administrator.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Seismic Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Seismic Direct Sign-On connector\n\n\n page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\n\nSeismic Direct Sign-On\n\naccount. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Tenant\n  |\n Enter your Seismic tenant.\n  |\n|\n Client ID\n  |\n Enter y\n\nour Seimic client ID for password flow authentication.\n  |\n|\n Client Secret\n  |\n Enter y\n\nour Seimic client secret for password flow authentication.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your\n\nSeismic username for direct sign-on.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your\n\nSeismic password for direct sign-on.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid\n\n\n Seismic Direct Sign-On\n\n\n credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\n\n Seismic Direct Sign-On\n\n\n DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the\n\n\n Seismic Direct Sign-On\n\n\n report you want to run. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Content Property Assignments\n  |\n Provides data on content property assignments.\n  |\n|\n Content Usage History\n  |\n Provides data on users usage/deliveries of content sourced from the Library.\n  |\n|\n Content View History\n  |\n Provides data on users views of content.\n  |\n|\n Library Contents\n  |\n Provides a list of content in the Control Center Library.\n  |\n|\n Livesend Link Contents\n  |\n Provides a list of content contained in Livesend links.\n  |\n|\n Livesend Link Members\n  |\n Provides a list of email recipients for each Livesend link.\n  |\n|\n Livesend Links\n  |\n Provides a list of all Livesend links created by all users from all applications.\n  |\n|\n Livesend Page Views\n  |\n Provides a timeline of page views for all Livesend content viewed.\n  |\n|\n Search History\n  |\n Provides data on searches in the platform.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Provides a list of users in the system, including deleted users.\n  |\n|\n WorkSpace Contents\n  |\n Provides a list of content in Workspace for all users.\n  |\n|\n Teamsites\n  |\n Provides the full list of teamsites in a tenant, regardless of user access.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a single date (e.g. January 23) or a date range (e.g. January 23-January 31).\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today. If you choose\n ********Specific********\n , the report will always pull data for the selected date whenever it runs. If you choose\n ********Relative********\n , the report will pull data for the entered number of back days whenever it runs. For example, if you selected\n ********Relative********\n and entered\u00a07\u00a0for the number of days back, each time the report ran it would pull data for the last 7 days.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the report date you want to pull data for using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data for. Specify either today or 0, yesterday or 1, or today-7 or 7 to get data for 7 days into the past.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n ********End Date.******** |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the last date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n ********Start Date.******** |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the last date in your date range\u00a0using the date selector.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data from (start day). Combine with\n ********Days Back to End At********\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\u00a010\u00a0for\n ********Days Back to Start From********\n and\u00a05\u00a0for\n ********Days Back to End At********\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of days back that you would like to get data to (end day). Combine with\n ********Days Back to Start From********\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\u00a010\u00a0for\n ********Days Back to Start From********\n and\u00a05\u00a0for\n ********Days Back to End At********\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4770992455575\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003189\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSeismic Connector for Direct Sign-On\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,670\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "seismic_connector_for_direct_signon", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
