When multi-factor authentication is enabled, users who log into\n                        \n                        Domo\n                        \n                         are sent an authentication code via text message. They must then enter this code to access\n                        \n                        Domo\n                        \n                         . If they have not entered mobile numbers into Domo, they will receive an email instead. They will not receive a separate prompt.\n                        \n\n\n                        The mobile app does not currently act as the second factor for authentication. Users on mobile will need to receive the SMS message the first time they log in.\n                       \n\n                        If enabling multi-factor authentication outside the US, please note that your valid mobile phone number MUST start with a country code. For instance, if receiving SMS notifications in Japan, enter your number as \"+81 80-1234-5678\" where 81 is the Japan country code. If you are unsure what your country code is, see\n                        \n                         https://countrycode.org/\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n                            Multi-Factor Authentication settings are not enforced when users log in through SSO. If you require multi-factor authentication for SSO users, this needs to be configured with the identity provider. Direct Sign-On users will still have multi-factor authentication applied to their logins.
