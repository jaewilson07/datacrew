The following chart properties have been deprecated. Note that for properties you applied by checking a box, if you applied the property before it became deprecated, the property still appears in your Chart Properties and is checked. However, if you uncheck the box and then resave the chart, the option is no longer available.

 Use Legacy Funnel
  |
 When this box was checked, the legacy version of the Funnel graph was used. This version showed both value and percent columns in the legend, and percentages for each layer in the legend were derived from the total value of the chart,
 *not*
 from the previous layer.

 Allow Wide Bars

 Allow Tall Bars
  |
 Determined whether the bar in a Horizontal Bar graph with a single bar used the full height of the available space. If this box was checked, the bar took up all of the space in the graph. Otherwise, a normal-sized bar appeared in the center of the chart space.
