Zendesk Talk Connector instantly connects, visualizes, and gets insights from your Zendesk Talk data. Use Domo's Zendesk Talk Connector to get statistics about the current queue, your account, your agents, or their activities. To learn more about the Zendesk API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developer.zendesk.com/rest\\_api/docs/core/introduction\n\n).\n\n\n The Zendesk Connector is a \"Cloud App\" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking\n ****Cloud App****\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n For information about the Zendesk Chat Connector, see\n\nZendesk Chat Connector\n\n.\n\n\n You connect to your Zendesk account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Zendesk Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Zendesk account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username for your Zendesk account\n* The API token OR password for your Zendesk account\n* The Zendesk URL for your company\n\nTo use a password, enable API authentication using an agent's email address and password. This may already be enabled for sign-in to the Zendesk Support mobile apps.\n\n\n Zendesk recommends that you use API tokens to keep your agents' passwords safe. API tokens are managed in the Zendesk Support Admin interface at\n ****Admin > Channels > API****\n . The page lets you view, add, or delete tokens. More than one token can be active at the same time. Deleting a token deactivates it permanently.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Zendesk Account\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n ****Credentials****\n and\n ****Details****\n panes in the Zendesk Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n ****Scheduling****\n and\n ****Name & Describe Your DataSet****\n , are universal across most Connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Zendesk account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into your Zendesk account.\n  |\n|\n Authenticate By\n  |\n Specify whether you want to use your Zendesk API token or password to authenticate.\n  |\n|\n API Token or Password\n  |\n Enter your Zendesk API token or password. This\n **must**\n match what you have selected in the\n ****Authenticate By****\n menu. For example, if you selected\n ****API Token****\n for\n ****Authenticate By****\n , you must enter your API token in this field, not your password.\n  |\n|\n Zendesk URL\n  |\n Enter the URL for your company's Zendesk instance.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid Zendesk credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Zendesk DataSet. You can manage Connector accounts in the\n ****Accounts****\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Zendesk Talk report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Account Overview\n  |\n Returns account overview statistics.
