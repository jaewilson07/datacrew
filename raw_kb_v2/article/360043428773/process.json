For example, in the following screenshot, a scale marker has been set for $1000, which the company achieved on January 5th and 14th.\n\n\n \ufeff\n\nYou can do this using two different methods: by entering a value into the\n **Goal**\n field above the chart, or by using Chart Properties. If you enter goals using both methods, two different goal markers are added to the chart.\n\n\n Adding a Goal Using the Goal Field\n------------------------------------\n\nThe simplest way to configure a goal marker is by entering a target value in the\n **Goal**\n field.\u00a0This field\u00a0is found\u00a0in the dialog of additional options\u00a0that appears when you click a column name in the fields region above the chart preview.\u00a0This field is available only for value data.\n\nWhen you add a goal in this way, it appears as a simple orange line on the value you have specified. You cannot apply special formatting such as custom styles, colors, or width, and you cannot set a range of values. If you want to customize your goal line in this way, use Chart Properties.\n\n\n The\n **Goal**\n option is available for most kinds of Bar and Line graphs, as well as Radar graphs, Lollipop graphs, Area graphs, stock graphs, and more.\n\n\n**To add a goal in this way,**\n\n. In the field region above the chart preview in Analyzer, click the value column\u00a0you want to add a goal to.\n2. Enter your numerical goal into the\n **Goal**\n field.\n\nAdding a Goal Using Chart Properties\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to customize your goal line by changing the color, width, styling, etc., or including a range of values instead of a single line, you can use Chart Properties to add the goal. You can also change the default text that describes the goal number (which says \"GOAL\" by default).\n\n\n**To add a goal using Chart Properties,**\n\n. In Chart Properties, expand the\n **Scale Marker**\n category.\n2. Configure the options you want.\n\nThe following table lists and describes all of the properties available for configuring goal markers for a chart. All of these properties can be found in the\n **Scale Marker**\n category in Chart Properties. These properties are available for most kinds of Bar and Line graphs, as well as Lollipop graphs, Area graphs, stock graphs, and more.\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Text\n  |\n Lets you specify\u00a0text to replace the default word \"GOAL\" that normally appears above the top left corner of the graph when a scale marker has been set. If the graph contains a legend, an item for the scale marker is added to the legend with this text (unless you hide it by checking the\n **Scale Marker > Hide in Legend**\n box).\n\n\n The example shows a chart in which \"MONTHLY TARGET\" has been entered as the custom text.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Scale\n  |\n In dual-scale graphs, lets you specify whether the goal in the graph is associated with the left or\u00a0right scale.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Type\n  |\n Lets you specify whether the scale marker is a line or a range of values.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Value\n  |\n Lets you specify the value of your scale marker line. This option is only available when you select\n **Line**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Color\n  |\n Lets you specify the color\u00a0of your scale marker line, together with the color of the goal value that appears above the top left corner of the graph.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Line**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n\n\n In the example, the user has selected a red-orange color for the line and value.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Width\n  |\n Lets you specify the width of your scale marker line\u2014either\n **Thin**\n (the default),\n **Medium**\n , and\n **Thick**\n . This option is only available when you select\n **Line**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n\n\n In the example, the user has selected\n **Thick**\n for this option.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Style\n  |\n Lets you select whether your scale marker line appears solid (default) or dashed.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Line**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n\n\n In the example, the user has selected\n **Dashed**\n for this option.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Upper Value\n  |\n Lets you select the value for the upper line in your scale marker range.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n\n\n |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Lower Value\n  |\n Lets you select the value for the lower\u00a0line in your scale marker range.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Fill Color\n  |\n Lets you select the fill color\u00a0for\u00a0your scale marker range.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Fill Transparency Percent\n  |\n Lets you enter an transparency\u00a0percentage for the fill in your scale marker range. This should be a value between 0 and 100. The higher the value, the more transparent the fill. This option is only available when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Border Color\n  |\n Lets you select the\u00a0border color\u00a0for\u00a0your scale marker range.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Border Style\n  |\n Lets you select whether the borders of your scale marker range\u00a0appear\u00a0solid (default) or dashed.\u00a0This option is only available when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Outlier Fill Color\n  |\n Lets you select the fill color between the line and scale marker range.\u00a0This option is only available only for Line graphs and only when you select\n **Range**\n in the\n **Type**\n menu.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Outlier Fill Transparency Percent\n  |\n Lets you enter an transparency\u00a0percentage for the fill between the line and scale marker range.\u00a0This should be a value between 0 and 100.
