Intro
-------

In the Analyzer, you can specify a scale marker or range for a goal you hope to achieve (or a scenario you want to avoid, such as dropping under a certain value). For example, in the following screenshot, a scale marker has been set for $1000, which the company achieved on January 5th and 14th.


 ﻿

You can do this using two different methods: by entering a value into the
 **Goal**
 field above the chart, or by using Chart Properties. If you enter goals using both methods, two different goal markers are added to the chart.


 Adding a Goal Using the Goal Field
------------------------------------

The simplest way to configure a goal marker is by entering a target value in the
 **Goal**
 field. This field is found in the dialog of additional options that appears when you click a column name in the fields region above the chart preview. This field is available only for value data.

When you add a goal in this way, it appears as a simple orange line on the value you have specified. You cannot apply special formatting such as custom styles, colors, or width, and you cannot set a range of values. If you want to customize your goal line in this way, use Chart Properties.


 The
 **Goal**
 option is available for most kinds of Bar and Line graphs, as well as Radar graphs, Lollipop graphs, Area graphs, stock graphs, and more.


**To add a goal in this way,**

. In the field region above the chart preview in Analyzer, click the value column you want to add a goal to.
2. Enter your numerical goal into the
 **Goal**
 field.

Adding a Goal Using Chart Properties
--------------------------------------

If you want to customize your goal line by changing the color, width, styling, etc., or including a range of values instead of a single line, you can use Chart Properties to add the goal. You can also change the default text that describes the goal number (which says "GOAL" by default).


**To add a goal using Chart Properties,**

. In Chart Properties, expand the
 **Scale Marker**
 category.
2. Configure the options you want.

The following table lists and describes all of the properties available for configuring goal markers for a chart. All of these properties can be found in the
 **Scale Marker**
 category in Chart Properties. These properties are available for most kinds of Bar and Line graphs, as well as Lollipop graphs, Area graphs, stock graphs, and more.
