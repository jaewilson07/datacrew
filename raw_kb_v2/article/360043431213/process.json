For example, a DataSet may be reporting daily metrics for multiple campaigns. You could add up the daily data for all the campaigns in order to determine the total for the account that holds the campaigns. This works for some metrics like Clicks, Spend, or Impressions. However, for metrics that count individual people (such as \"Reach\"), this approach will fail and produce incorrect values. \"Reach,\" for example, fails because individuals are counted for each day they saw an ad. Then, if the Reach values for the month are added together, those people are counted multiple times. If the user compares this result to the result for the month in the Facebook Ads UI, they find that the aggregated value is far too high. The Facebook Ads UI removed the duplicated viewers, and only counted them once in the specified time period.\n                       \n\n                        To avoid this problem, any time the user wants to get a value for a larger time period, the period needs to be defined in the DataSet itself, and not calculated afterward. If a user wants Reach for a particular month, the DataSet should be defined with the start and end dates for the month, and the\n                        \n                         Time Increment\n                        \n                        value should be set to\n                        \n                         all_days\n                        \n                        or left blank. The user can get monthly data, aggregated and deduplicated by Facebook, by setting a large date range (for example, Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2016) and entering\n                        \n                         monthly\n                        \n                        as the\n                        \n                         Time Increment\n                        \n                        value. Similarly, if a user wants Reach data at the Account level, the user needs to set the DataSet's\n                        \n                         Level\n                        \n                        value to\n                        \n                         Accounts\n                        \n                        (not\n                        \n                         Campaigns\n                        \n                        ), followed by summing the values in Domo.\n                       \n\n                        It is often useful to compare the results of the connector to the results available in the Facebook Ads UI. To perform the comparison correctly, however, the UI and the connector need to be configured identically. They need to be set to the same time period (start and end dates) as well as the same reporting level and time increment value.\n                       \n\n                        Troubleshooting\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Does the user have access to the company's Facebook Ads account?\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Is the time range valid for the account/campaigns/ad sets/ads selected?\n                         \n\n\n\n                        FAQ\n                       \n\n                        What version of the Facebook API does this connector use?\n                       \n\n                        This connector uses version 16 of the Facebook Marketing API (\n                        \n                         https://graph.facebook.com/v16\n                        \n                        ).\n                       \n\n                        Do I need a certain kind of account to set up the connector?\n                       \n\n                        You will need a Facebook account that has access to the Facebook Ads account(s) that you are interested in.

For more options and flexibility with report configuration, you should use the Advanced connector.\n                       \n\n                        How often can the data be updated?\n                       \n\n                        The data in this connector is roughly real-time. However, many statistics are subject to change for up to 3 days as Facebook determines the exact number of views, etc.\n                       \n\n                        Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n                       \n\n                        Facebook may enforce rate limits on calls to its API, but you should not have to worry about this.\n                       \n\n                        My Facebook Ads DataSets take a long time to run.

Depending on the load on their servers, this can take a LONG time. It seems that scheduling queries for off-peak times helps DataSets run faster. For example, one team in India was able to run a Facebook Ads DataSet in 15 minutes, but when another user tried the same DataSet 6-8 hours later, it took about 2 hours.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360043431213", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
