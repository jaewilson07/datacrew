Slow Execution
----------------

*Description**


 A notebook cell execution takes longer than expected or seems to hang for a long time.


**Common Cause**


 While working with large amounts of data can take time, a slowed execution may occur if your workspace does not have enough resources for the job.


**Troubleshooting Steps**


 If a notebook cell execution is slow, you may need to increase the size of the workspace.


 1. From the
 **Jupyter Workspaces**
 list, select

*Menu**
 next to the workspace. Choose
 **Edit.**

2. Choose an option with a higher
 **Compute Tier Limit**
 .


 3. Select

* Notebook cells executed in order result in an error
* The notebook file has been deleted
* Error accessing third-party system

*Troubleshooting Steps**


 1. Attempt to execute the notebook's cells in order from within the Jupyter Workspace environment.
