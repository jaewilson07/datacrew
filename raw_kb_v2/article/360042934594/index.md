Intro
-------

DomoStats gives you the freedom to explore how your team is using Domo. Because DomoStats is powered by a live Domo DataSet with no configuration, you can easily build cards, alerts, and workflows around the metrics you want to see as well as use the pre-built dashboard.


 The DomoStats Activity Log App provides key insights into how your organization is using Domo. See activities like how many people are logging in each day, the top favorited cards, and how many DataSets were created last week. Stay up to date and informed on all the activity happening in your Domo instance.

*Note:**
 There are known limitations with using the Activity Log App to track certifications for cards and DataSets. To join the Beta for a DomoStats report that tracks certifications, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Executive (AE).
