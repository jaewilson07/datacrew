See activities like how many people are logging in each day, the\u00a0top favorited cards, and how many DataSets were created last week. Stay up to date and informed on all the activity happening in your Domo instance.\n\n*Note:**\n There are known limitations with using the Activity Log App to track certifications for cards and DataSets. To join the Beta for a DomoStats report that tracks certifications, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Executive (AE).\n\nRequirements\n--------------\n\nYou must have admin-level access to download the DomoStats Activity Log App from the Appstore.\n\n\n Using the DomoStats App\n-------------------------\n\nYou can use the pre-built dashboard or build any of your own content using the DomoStats DataSets in the Data Center. When you first download the app, a new page is created titled DomoStats - Activity Log. You'll need to power up the dashboard with the following steps:\n\n. Navigate to the\n **DomoStats - Activity Log**\n page.\n2. Select\n **Connect Data**\n .\n3. In the drop-down, select\n **Connect**\n to connect the page to the DomoStats DataSets or select\n **Assign**\n if you want to assign another Domo user to set up the data.\n4. In the last window, select\n **Connect**\n .\n5. The pre-built dashboard is now powered up and ready to use.\n\nThe dashboard\n---------------\n\n\n###\n Data\n\nThe following data is included in the download of the DomoStats - Activity Log app and can be found in the Data Center as a 'DomoStats' type DataSet.\n\n\n DataSets include:\n\n People\n* Activity Log\n\nDataFlows include:\n\n Activity Log - User Inactivity\n\n*Note:**\n All DataSets powering the app run once a day. Runtime is every 24 hours from when the app is first deployed. While the run frequency cannot be changed, you can edit the\u00a0runtime in the DataSet settings. For more information on how to schedule DataSets, see\n\nDataSet Scheduling\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Cards\n\nThe following cards are included in the pre-built dashboard.\n\n  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Collection**  | **Card**  | **Description**  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Distinct User Logins\n  |\n Distinct user logins over time.\n  |\n|\n Login Rate - Last 14 Days\n  |\n Percentage of users that logged into Domo during the given time period.
