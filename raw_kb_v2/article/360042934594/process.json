See activities like how many people are logging in each day, the\u00a0top favorited cards, and how many DataSets were created last week. Stay up to date and informed on all the activity happening in your Domo instance.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           There are known limitations with using the Activity Log App to track certifications for cards and DataSets.
