Groups are useful because you can grant access to specified content to all members of a group. For example, you might\u00a0create a \"Marketing\" group whose members have access to marketing-related cards. Or, you could create a \"Financial\" group with access to cards from various departments. You can also create dynamic groups in which members are determined automatically based on whether they meet specified criteria. For example, you could create a dynamic group that includes all members of the \"Marketing\" department with the title of \"Manager.\" If one of your marketing managers later left the company and was replaced by a new manager, this person would be added to the group automatically.\n                       \n\n                        In\n                        \n                         More >\n                        \n\n                         Admin > Governance > Groups\n                        \n                        , you can do all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Create and delete groups\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Add and remove members of groups\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Change the name of a group\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Send a Buzz message to all members of a group\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Share a Card or Page with all members of a group\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Assign owners to a group\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Change a group type\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Change other group settings\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Change the avatar for the group\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Most of these actions are only available if you are a group owner.

Only group owners may invite new members to a closed group. Owners must be named individuals or groups, and members must be named individuals. Any changes made to closed groups are reflected in the\n                        \n                         Activity Logs\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Closed groups may be assigned as owners of other groups and Domo assets (Cards and Pages).\n                       \n\n\n                         Closed groups cannot be changed to any other group type, once a group is created as a closed group, it cannot be changed.\n                        \n\n\n                        Open groups\n                       \n\n                        Open groups are \"social groups\" within Domo. In these groups, the group owns itself. This means that every member is an owner and may invite other users to join. These groups are ideal for generating Buzz conversations and broadly sharing content, or organizing contact groups. Open groups cannot own other groups.\n                       \n\n                        Dynamic groups\n                       \n\n                        Dynamic groups provide scalable, flexible administration based on policy-based membership. You create membership policies\u00a0that reference trusted attributes; thereafter, Domo does the work of maintaining the membership. For example, you could create a dynamic group with a rule stating that all members must belong to the \"Marketing\" department. From then on, if anyone joins that department, or if anyone in said\u00a0department leaves the company, the group membership is adjusted automatically.\n                       \n\n                        Dynamic groups may contain individuals or groups (\n                        \n                         not\n                        \n                        other dynamic groups) as owners.\n                       \n\n                        For attributes to be available for use in dynamic groups, you must first lock them in\n                        \n                         More >\n                        \n\n                         Admin > Governance > Trusted attributes.\n                        \n                        This can be done only by users with \"Admin\" security privileges. Locked attributes can only be unlocked by Admin users and only when they are not being used in any dynamic groups or PDP policies. For example, if user Fred\u00a0creates a dynamic group\u00a0that filters on the \"Department\" attribute, and Admin user Barney then goes into Admin Settings to unlock that attribute, he would not be able to do so. Fred or Barney would first need to remove the policy from the group.\n                       \n\n                        In continuation, we describe how to\u00a0enable/lock\u00a0attributes in the Admin Settings.
