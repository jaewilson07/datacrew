This article addresses connecting to data from the SAP ECC (ERP Central Component) tool. This connector consists of several modules, including utilities for marketing and sales, field service, product design and development, production and inventory control, human resources, finance and accounting. SAP ERP collects and combines data from the separate modules to provide the company or organization with enterprise resource planning.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Primary Use Cases\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Just in time inventory tracking\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Finance\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Production quality and efficiency\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Profit and loss tracking\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Availability of critical equipment\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Primary Metrics\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Purchase orders\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Purchase requests\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Income statement\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Balance sheet\n                             \n\n\n\n                              General ledger\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Sales orders\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Accounts receivable\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Accounts payable\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Materials\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Manufacturing\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Primary Company Roles\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CEO\n                             \n\n\n\n                              CFO\n                             \n\n\n\n                              HR\n                             \n\n\n\n                              Sales Manager\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Average Implementation Time\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            80 hours\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Ease of Implementation (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            10\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Architecture\n                       \n\n                        The architecture of this connection can be summed up as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          A Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is created in ECC and published for subscription (Publish & Subscribe).\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The service generates a Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) XML file which defines the flow of data.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Domo then calls the service through the WSDL and requests data as defined by the WSDL.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          ECC then interrogates the call and sends data through the SOA packet.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          This is all controlled and defined in SAP ECC and Netweaver.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Connection Summary\n                       \n\n                        To connect to SAP data in Domo, you must establish a DOMO-SAP data link.
