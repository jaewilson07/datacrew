Depending on browser type and user settings, the Domo cookie may be rejected when embedding Domo in an iFrame. For example, the Safari browser requires a user to either visit a Domo site first or to change their privacy settings in order to load Domo in an iFrame. Learn more about Safari\n\nhere\n\n.\n\n\n To support these browsers, Domo provides a bounce page. This bounce page automatically loads a Domo page that sets a cookie, then returns the user to the referring site. For security reasons, this bounce page only works when the user\u2019s browser originates from one of the sites listed below. Wild cards in the form of an asterisk \u201c\\*\u201d are allowed as a placeholder for the subdomain or path. Find more information on how to implement the bounce page in your custom app or embedding website\n\nhere\n\n.\n\n##\n\n\n IP Address Whitelist\n\nThe Whitelist sub-tab lets you whitelist specific IP addresses in Domo.
