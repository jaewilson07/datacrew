Symbol Overlay charts are similar to

Symbol charts

, the difference being that in a Symbol chart, symbols in a given series are shown side by side rather than overlaid on top of each other.


 Symbol Overlay charts include both vertical and horizontal subtypes. In a vertical Symbol Overlay chart, categories are represented along the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and values are measured on the vertical axis (or y-axis). A horizontal Symbol Overlay chart has the same overall concept, but the categories are represented along the vertical axis and the values are represented along the horizontal axis.


 Powering Symbol Overlay charts
--------------------------------

A Symbol Overlay chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet—one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see
