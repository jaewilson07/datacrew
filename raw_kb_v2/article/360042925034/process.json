In a vertical Symbol Overlay chart, categories\u00a0are represented along the horizontal axis (or x-axis) and values\u00a0are measured on the vertical axis (or y-axis).\u00a0A horizontal\u00a0Symbol Overlay chart has the same overall concept, but the categories are represented along the vertical axis and the values are represented along the horizontal axis.\n\n\n Powering\u00a0Symbol Overlay charts\n--------------------------------\n\nA\u00a0Symbol Overlay chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet\u2014one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your\u00a0Symbol Overlay chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a\u00a0vertical Symbol\u00a0Overlay chart:\n\nThe following graphic shows you how the data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a\u00a0horizontal Symbol\u00a0Overlay chart:\n\nCustomizing\u00a0Symbol Overlay charts\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a\u00a0Symbol chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n .
