These properties are divided across five distinct regions\u2014West, Southwest, Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. You want\u00a0to be able to see at a glance the revenue gained from each region, something like the following:\n\nHowever, Domo does not include a preinstalled map for regions of the United States (and if it did, the states in each grouping would probably not exactly correspond to the states in the regions in your company).\n\n\n The solution is to set up custom regional groupings. There are two ways to do this in Domo:\n\n Customize an SVG map of the United States by adding grouping tags, as discussed in detail in\n\nCustom Charts\n\n. This requires a rudimentary knowledge of XML.\n* Use the Custom Regions tool to upload a DataSet\u00a0that includes a column for the new custom regions matched with the sub-regions within them. This solution requires a simple understanding of\n\nDomo dataset structure\n\n; however, knowledge of XML is not required.\n\nThis topic discusses the second option, including how to set up your DataSets properly. For an in-depth discussion of building custom charts from scratch, see\n\nCustom Charts\n\n.\n\n*Video - Custom Map Regions**\n\nSetting Up Your DataSet\n-------------------------\n\nBefore you can incorporate regions into a map, you must first ensure that your DataSet\u00a0is set up properly.\u00a0The DataSet\n *must*\n contain the following columns for regions to work:\n\n A column with the names of the regions (i.e. the larger geographical areas your sub-regions will be divided between). For example, in the U.S. map shown above, there are 5 regions\u2014a Southwestern region that includes Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma; a Western region with California, Nevada, Idaho, etc.; and so on.\n* A column with the names of the sub-regions (i.e. the smaller geographical areas that will be divided across the larger areas). Sub-regions in the above map include individual states such as California, Texas, Alaska, etc.\n\nSo the DataSet\u00a0used to divide the above U.S. map into regions\u00a0would include columns that look something like the following:\n\nAs another example, here is a portion of a DataSet\u00a0used to divide a map of Canada into western, central, and eastern regions:\n\nThis DataSet\u00a0matches regions with three-digit FSA codes, though you could also use provinces if you wanted.\n\n\n The resulting map would look as follows (with shading based on a value column\u00a0applied afterward in the Analyzer):\n\nAdding Regions to a Map\n-------------------------\n\nOnce you have all of the necessary columns in your DataSet, you are ready to create a new regional map in your Domo instance. You must have an \"Admin\" default security profile or a custom role with \"Manage All Company Settings\" to add maps to Domo. For more information about default security roles, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n If you want to regionalize a map for a country\n\n\n not available in Domo,\u00a0you must first upload an SVG\u00a0map for that country. Y\n\nou can download SVG country\u00a0maps\u00a0from any of a number of websites, such as\n\nhttp://www.amcharts.com/svg-maps/\n\nand\n\nhttps://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-maps\n\n. These sites also include maps for overseas territories such as French Guiana, Aruba, and so on.\n\nFor more information about downloading SVG maps, see\n\nObtaining an SVG Chart\n\n.\n\n\n**To regionalize a map,**\n\n. Select\n **More**\n**> Admin**\n in the toolbar at the top of the screen.\n2. In Admin Settings, select\n **Company Settings > Custom Charts**\n .\n3. Click\n **Add Chart**\n .\n4. Click\n **Create regions**\n .\n5. Click on the map you want to add regions to, then click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n If the map you want to regionalize\u00a0has been added to Domo\u00a0using the Custom Charts tool, you can find it by switching to \"Custom Charts\" in the menu at the top of the dialog.\n\nIf the country map you want is not in Domo, you must first upload it. (See the note at the top of this section.)\n6. In the DataSet\u00a0dialog, use the search and filter options to locate the DataSet\u00a0with your regions data, then click\n **Select DataSet**\n .\n\n\n If the DataSet you need is not yet available in Domo, you can upload it by clicking\n **Add DataSet**\n then configuring the connector you want to use to pull data. For more information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n After you click\n **Select DataSet**\n , a new window opens in which you can select your region and sub-region columns.\n7. In the\n **Select new custom region**\n menu, select the name of the column containing your regions\u00a0(i.e. the larger geographical areas your sub-regions will be divided between).\n8. In the\n **Select column for subregions**\n menu, select the name of the column containing your subregions\u00a0(i.e. the smaller geographical areas that will be divided across the larger areas).\n\nAfter you make selections in both menus, your map should update to show the new regional areas.\n9. Click\n **Next**\n .\n\n\n A new window now opens in which you can choose from two configuration options.\n10. Uncheck the\n **Show lines separating sub-regions**\n box if you want to remove the borders between your subregions; otherwise leave this box checked.\n\n\n The following screenshot shows an example of this, in which the lines bordering the U.S. states have been removed:\n11. Uncheck the\n **Show sub-regions not included in DataSet**\n box if you want to hide regions not included in the DataSet; otherwise leave this box checked.\n\n\n The following screenshot shows an example of this, in which the \"Northeastern\" and \"Southeastern\" regions do not appear because there is no data for them in the DataSet. This is an excellent option to use when you want to show map data only for specific regions of a given country.\n12. Click\n **Next**\n .\n13. In the new window that appears, enter a name for the map.\n\n\n This is the name of the map as it will appear in the Chart Picker.\n14. (Optional) Enter a description for the map if desired.\n15. Click\n **Save**\n .\n\nThe map should now be available in the Chart Picker in Analyzer, under\n **Custom Charts**\n .\n\n\n Building Your Map in Analyzer\n-------------------------------\n\nAfter you upload your map to Domo, you can build a card from it in Analyzer just as you would any other country map. You can access the new map in\n **Custom Charts**\n in the Chart Picker. For instructions about building country maps, see\n\nCountry Map\n\n.\n\n\n Chart properties for custom maps are the same as those used in most other geographical maps. For a list of these properties, see\n\nProperties for Maps\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043428793\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004632\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCreating a Map with Regions\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,484\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "creating_a_map_with_regions", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "analyzer", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoUGAS"}]}
