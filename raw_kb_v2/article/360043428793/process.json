These properties are divided across five distinct regions\u2014West, Southwest, Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. You want\u00a0to be able to see at a glance the revenue gained from each region, something like the following:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        However, Domo does not include a preinstalled map for regions of the United States (and if it did, the states in each grouping would probably not exactly correspond to the states in the regions in your company).\n                       \n\n                        The solution is to set up custom regional groupings. There are two ways to do this in Domo:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Customize an SVG map of the United States by adding grouping tags, as discussed in detail in\n                          \n                           Custom Charts\n                          \n                          . This requires a rudimentary knowledge of XML.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Use the Custom Regions tool to upload a DataSet\u00a0that includes a column for the new custom regions matched with the sub-regions within them. This solution requires a simple understanding of\n                          \n                           Domo dataset structure\n                          \n                          ; however, knowledge of XML is not required.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        This topic discusses the second option, including how to set up your DataSets properly. For an in-depth discussion of building custom charts from scratch, see\n                        \n                         Custom Charts\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Custom Map Regions\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Setting Up Your DataSet\n                       \n\n                        Before you can incorporate regions into a map, you must first ensure that your DataSet\u00a0is set up properly.\u00a0The DataSet\n                        \n                         must\n                        \n                        contain the following columns for regions to work:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          A column with the names of the regions (i.e. the larger geographical areas your sub-regions will be divided between). For example, in the U.S. map shown above, there are 5 regions\u2014a Southwestern region that includes Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma; a Western region with California, Nevada, Idaho, etc.; and so on.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          A column with the names of the sub-regions (i.e. the smaller geographical areas that will be divided across the larger areas). Sub-regions in the above map include individual states such as California, Texas, Alaska, etc.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        So the DataSet\u00a0used to divide the above U.S. map into regions\u00a0would include columns that look something like the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        As another example, here is a portion of a DataSet\u00a0used to divide a map of Canada into western, central, and eastern regions:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        This DataSet\u00a0matches regions with three-digit FSA codes, though you could also use provinces if you wanted.\n                       \n\n                        The resulting map would look as follows (with shading based on a value column\u00a0applied afterward in the Analyzer):\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Adding Regions to a Map\n                       \n\n                        Once you have all of the necessary columns in your DataSet, you are ready to create a new regional map in your Domo instance. You must have an \"Admin\" default security profile or a custom role with \"Manage All Company Settings\" to add maps to Domo.
