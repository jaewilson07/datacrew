In a Details view, you can get a closer look at the data in the Card. You also have access to options not available in pages.\n\n\n Some options are the same for the\u00a0Details\n\nviews for all Card types. For example, in the\u00a0Details\u00a0view for any Card type you can add the Card as a Favorite. Other options may be available depending on the Card type. For example, in the Details view for a Visualization Card you can open the Analyzer and make edits to the chart data; in the Details view for a Doc Card you can download documents; and so on. This topic discusses these similarities and differences.\n\n\n Opening the Card Details view\n-------------------------------\n\nIn a standard Page, you can open the Details view for a Card by doing any of the following:\n\n Clicking the Card.\n* Opening\n\nand selecting\n **Details**\n .\n* Clicking any of the icons at the bottom of the Card.\n\nWith poll Cards, you can also open the Details view by clicking any of the links that allow you to see the poll results.

For more information, see\n\nFiltering Data in a Card Details View\n\n.\n\n####\n Issues Reported tab\n\nWhen you click\n\n, the\n **Issues Reported**\n tab appears. In this tab, you can read about reported issues, mark issues as resolved, and report new issues. For more information, see\n\nReporting Issues with Cards\n\n.\u00a0A number next to the name of this tab indicates the number of issues that have been reported on the Card. (If no issues have been reported, this tab does not appear.)\n\n####\n Alerts tab\n\nWhen you click\n\n, the\n **Alerts**\n tab appears. In this tab, you can create an alert on the Card, follow or unfollow an alert, edit an alert, delete an alert, or view the history of all alerts that have been triggered on the Card. A number next to the name of this tab indicates that one or more alerts have been triggered on this Card. For more information, see\n\nManaging Custom Alerts\n\n.\n\n###\n Table view\n\nThe\n **Table**\n view shows a table of the non-graphical underlying data for the Visualization Card. This view of the chart provides the\n *raw*\n data in the DataSet; it does not include any HTML formatting.\n\n\n The column header labels that appear in this view are the same as those in the\n\nDataSet\n\npowering the Card. However, you can change the column header labels in the\n\n*Edit**\n\nview for the Card. For more information, see\n\nEditing the Column Header Labels for Your Chart Table View\n\n.\n\nYou can change the sorting for any column in the table by clicking the up or down arrow to the right of a column heading. For example, in the table in the preceding screenshot, clicking the arrow to the right of \"Widgets Sold\" would cause the numerical data to be sorted from high to low.\n\n###\n Analyzer\n\nIn the\n **Analyzer**\n view, you can change elements of the Visualization Card, such as its name, description, chart type, applied DataSet columns, Filters, and sorting criteria. For more information about the\n **Analyzer**\n view, see\n\nAnalyzer Layout\n\n.\n\n\n This view is only accessible by users with \"Admin,\" \"Privileged,\" or \"Editor\" default security roles OR a custom security role with the \"Edit Cards\" privilege enabled. For more information about default security roles, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n###\n History view\n\nIn the\n **History**\n view, you can see all past versions of this Visualization Card. A new version is created every time you save the Card. When you open this view, a list of versions is shown, with the specific changes for each version. Also, if the updating user added a comment to explain why certain changes were made, the comment is shown as well.\n\nWhen you click\n **View**\n for a version of the Visualization Card in the list, that version displays. While in this mode, you can see the previous or next version in the list by clicking\n **Previous revision**\n or\n **Next revision**\n , respectively.

Vertical and/or horizontal scroll bars are provided in both views if there is more data than will fit on the screen. In\n **Pivot View**\n , when you scroll vertically, the totals column on the right also scrolls vertically, but the totals row along the bottom remains in place; this lets you always see the sum of all values in a column. Conversely, when you scroll horizontally, the totals row along the bottom scrolls, and the totals column on the right remains in place.\n\n\n Also in\n **Pivot View**\n , when you apply an aggregation, the totals reflect the aggregation you have applied, not just the sum of a row or column. For example, if you select\n **Average**\n as your aggregation, the total for each row and column is the average of all the averages in that row or column.\n  |\n\n\n Also, i\n\n\n f\n\nPDP\n\nhas been enabled for the\n\nDataSet\n\npowering this Sumo Card, a\n\nlabel appears next to the Card name.
