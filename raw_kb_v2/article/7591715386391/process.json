This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the freee Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your freee account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The email address for your freee account.\n* The password for the freee account.\n* Creating an application in freee.\n\nFor information on how to create an application in freee, please see\n\nfreee API \u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nfreee\n\nAccount\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the Credentials and Details panes on the freee Connector page. The components of the other panes on this page, Scheduling, and Name & Describe Your DataSet, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n\n###\n Credentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your freee account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n [CONNECT] button\n  |\n\nPress the [CONNECT] button to display the freee login page\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Mail address\n  |\n\nEnter the Mail address of your freee account.\n\n|\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password of your freee account.\n  |\n|\n [\u8a31\u53ef\u3059\u308b] button\n  |\n Press the [\u8a31\u53ef\u3059\u308b] button to allow the connector to retrieve the data from your freee account.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have allowed the connector collects data from freee, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new freee DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n\n*Accounts**\n\ntab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\n\n Managing User Accounts for Connectors\n\n\n .\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n\n*Reports**\n\nmenu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n|\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n REPORT\n  |\n\nSelect the report you want to run.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 7591715386391\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003823\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nfreee Third Party Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,804\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:15 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "freee_third_party_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "available_custom_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoVGAS"}]}
