Histograms are most often used for statistical analysis.\n\n\n Understanding\u00a0histograms\n--------------------------\n\nIn a histogram, two axes appear, one on the left side of the graph and one at the bottom.\u00a0One of the\u00a0axes is divided into ranges of values\u00a0called \"bins.\"\u00a0The\u00a0other axis measures the number of items in the DataSet that fall into each bin.\u00a0For each bin, a bar is drawn that represents the number of\u00a0items in the bin. In a vertical\u00a0histogram, the\u00a0axis with the bins appears on the bottom and the axis that measures the items appears on the left. In a horizontal histogram, these axes are\u00a0switched.\n\n\n The following\u00a0example shows how a histogram works. This\u00a0histogram\u00a0represents the frequency at which specific height ranges appear in a group of students. The bottom axis shows the complete range of heights in the DataSet, with bins for individual ranges. The left axis measures the number of\u00a0items\u2013in this case,\u00a0students\u2013that fall into each bin.\n\nPowering histograms\n---------------------\n\nHistograms\u00a0require\u00a0only two\u00a0data columns or rows from your DataSet. One of the columns contains category names, and the other contains the associated values. Note that the category names themselves do not appear in the chart, but are counted and represented numerically. Also, values do not appear as is, but are converted into ranges in your chart. An optimal number of ranges (and hence, bins) is determined automatically, but you can change the default number of bins in\n **Chart Properties,**\n as seen in the section below on Customizing histograms.\n\n\n**Note:**\n Histograms\n\nhave a limit of 25,000 rows of data.\n\nFor information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your histogram. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.\n\n\n###\n Examples\n\nThe following graphic shows you how data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a vertical histogram:\n\nThe following graphic shows you how data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a horizontal histogram:\n\nCustomizing histograms\n------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a histogram by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . Properties for all chart types are listed and described in\n\nChart Properties.\n\nUnique properties of\u00a0histograms include the following. You can click a thumbnail image to see a larger image.\n\n\n Property\n  |\n Description\n  |\n Example\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Bar Settings\u00a0> Symbol Color\n  |\n Allows you to set the color for bins. The default is blue.\n  |\n \u2014\n  |\n|\n Bar Settings > Histogram Bins\n  |\n Lets you change the number of bins that appear in the histogram. An optimal number of bins is determined automatically by Domo, but you can choose any number between 3 and 20. Changing the number of bins may create \"gaps\" for ranges with no data. The example at right shows one such gap in the 4.9-5.0 data range. This indicates that there were no items in the DataSet with a value between 4.9 and 5.0.\n  |\n\n|\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043429193\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004706\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nHistogram\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,301\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:25 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "histogram", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
