For more information about writing SQL queries for ODBC and OLAP DataSets, see\n\nConnecting to an OLAP cube\n\n.\n\n\n In Workbench 5,\u00a0a \"Lookup Table\" is a DataSet you combine with a primary DataSet.\u00a0The Lookup Table\n *must*\n be saved as a DataSet job in Workbench or the join will not work. The Lookup Table DataSet and primary DataSet must both contain one column with unique matching values (\"key columns\"); that is, the values in both columns must be the same, but there cannot be duplicate values in either\u00a0column. In addition, the names of the matching columns\u00a0must be different.\u00a0(You can change\u00a0column names in Workbench if need be.) Once you match key columns, a new DataSet is created by joining all columns from both DataSets. Combining DataSets\u00a0in this way\u00a0is equivalent to using a LEFT JOIN in SQL.\n\n\n**To combine DataSets\u00a0using Lookup Tables,**\n\n. In Workbench, click\n\nin the left-hand icon bar.\n2. In the Jobs listing, double-click\u00a0the job with your primary data source (i.e. the data source you intend to combine with another data source).\n3. Click\n **Transforms**\n to expand that section of the pane.\n4. In the\n **Add a transform**\n menu, select\n **Lookup Table Transform**\n .\n5. Click the\n\nbutton.\n\n\n The\n **Lookup Table Transform Editor**\n appears.\n6. In the\n **Lookup Source DataSet**\n menu, select the\u00a0DataSet you intend to\u00a0combine with\u00a0your primary DataSet.\n\n\n The DataSet you select\n *must*\n be saved as a DataSet job in Workbench.\n\n\n If you have not yet uploaded the selected job to Domo, you are now asked if you want to do so.\n7. In the\n **Lookup Source Key**\n menu, select the column from the Lookup Source you intend to match with a column in your primary DataSet.\n8. In the\n **Primary Key**\n menu, select the matching column.\n9. (Optional) If you want Workbench to generate an error if your Lookup Source is found to be missing, turn on\n **Error on Missing Lookup**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n If any columns in your Lookup Table have the same name as columns in your primary table, you must change those names. You can do this by opening the\n **Schema**\n subtab for the DataSet job then making changes as necessary under\n **Destination Column**\n .\u00a0If necessary, you can also remove columns\u00a0by clearing the checkboxes for those columns under\n **Include**\n .\n10. Click\n **Apply**\n .\n11. Click\n\nat the top of the pane to save your transform.\n\nThe next time you run the job, the lookup source DataSet will be added to the primary DataSet in Domo.\n\n\n For information about joining DataSets in Domo, see\n\nData Transformation\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043437193\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004832\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCombining DataSets in Workbench 5\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,859\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:31 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "combining_datasets_in_workbench_5", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_5", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapTGAS"}]}
