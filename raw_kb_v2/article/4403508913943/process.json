This will allow users to:\n                       \n\n\n                         Filter for any column with the same flow you know from the full instance.\n                        \n\n                         Choose from default date ranges to jump quickly to popular time frames.\n                        \n\n                         Change trend granularity with the \u201cgraph by\u201d option for hour, day, week, etc.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Unlike filtering on Dashboards in your full instance of Domo, you cannot save the filtered view in the embedded instance.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Enabling Page Filters in Dashboard Embed\n                       \n\n\n                         Navigate to the Dashboard you would like to embed.\n                        \n\n                         Click the\n                         \n                         icon.\n                        \n\n                         Select\n                         \n                          Embed Dashboard\n                         \n                         from the dropdown menu.\n                        \n\n                         Enable the check the boxes for\n                         \n                          Allow interactions and filtering\n                         \n                         AND\n                         \n                          Show filter bar\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                        Using Page Filters in Dashboard Embed\n                       \n\n                        To apply Page Filters,\n                       \n\n\n                         Navigate to the Dashboard you would like to filter.\n                        \n\n                         Click on the blue filter icon located at the top right-hand side of the Dashboard.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Click the\n                         \n                          +\n                         \n                         button.\n                         \n\n                         A list of all column names used in DataSets in Cards in this Page appears.

Filter views allow you to customize a Page to meet the needs of all audiences. Using Filter views, you can do all of the following:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Create and save your own Filters without affecting anyone else's view.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Curate and share important views to create alignment on a specific perspective.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Provide any number of personalized data stories for any person in any role.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Designate which saved Filter view is the \"default\" for first-time visitors to a Page.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Any Subscriber can add Filter views as well as rename, copy, and delete his/her own Filter views. For more information on Filter views, see\n                        \n                         Applying Page-Level Filters with Filter Views\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Applying dynamic date range Filters\n                       \n\n                        You can use dynamic date range Filters to adjust the date range window for all the Cards on a Page. These Filters can be saved and used as the default for all users in a Page. They can also be saved to different Filter Views (described in the previous section). Dynamic date range Filters can be a huge time-saver, since users do not need to manually apply filters to see data for a given date or time range. Also, with dynamic date range Filters, the date range data for your Cards automatically \"rolls over\" when the current period ends.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           Dynamic date range filters only apply to Visualization Cards and Sumo Cards. They do NOT work on Doc Cards, Poll Cards, Notebook Cards, and Custom Apps.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        You choose dynamic date range Filters in the\n                        \n                         Choose Date\n                        \n                        menu in the gray filter bar at the top of a Page.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        The Filters you choose here are applied to all Cards in the Page that have had a\n                        \n                         date column applied in Analyzer\n                        \n                        . Filters are applied to each Card's unique date column and take into account date filters that have already been set on the Card. So for example, if a Page contained a Card that was powered by the \"Sales Dates\" column and the dates were filtered in Analyzer to show March through June, if dynamic date range Filters were set on the Page, the Filters would be applied to the \"Sales Dates\" column and would only work within the March-June time period. If the dynamic Filters were set outside that time period, the Card would display \"No data in filtered range.\"\n                       \n\n                        You are able to choose Cards that will not be affected by the dynamic date, by deselecting the\n                        \n                         Allow global date\n                        \n                        feature. More information can be found in the\n                        \n                         Controlling how Page Filters affect your Page\n                        \n                        section above. If you have chosen the\n                        \n                         Hide Date on Card Details\n                        \n                        option for a Card, the dynamic date will also not be applied to the Card.\n                       \n\n                        Most of the options for dynamic date range Filters are the same as those for filtering dates in the Analyzer. In essence, these options are as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Date Range\n                           \n\n                          . This lets you choose the range of data shown for all Cards in the Page being powered by date columns. By default\u00a0this is\u00a0set to\n                          \n\n                            Default\n                           \n\n                          , meaning that all Cards use their own date ranges. A wide variety of other options is available, including the current date period, period-to-date options such as\n                          \n                           Week to Date\n                          \n                          , and so on.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Graph By\n                           \n\n                          . This lets you choose the date grain for all Cards in the Page being powered by date columns.\u00a0The date grain determines\u00a0whether the data is shown by week, by month, etc. This menu is described in more detail in\n                          \n                           Changing the unit of time used to represent data\n                          \n                          . By default no date grain is selected, meaning the Cards use\u00a0the same date grain used in their powering DataSets. (For example, if data for a Card was broken down by week in the DataSet, it would be automatically broken down by week in the Card).\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           The Date Graph By does not impact Single Value charts.
