You can also specify a default value to appear in cells in which your search value does not appear.\n\nAfter searching for values in your data\u00a0by specifying a\n **Search Value**\n , you can transform the values\u00a0using regular expressions. For example, suppose you want to transform the date format of date values. Using regular expressions in the\n **Search\u00a0Value**\n and\n **Replace\u00a0With**\n fields, you could search for dates with a format of\n\nyyyymmdd\n\nand replace them with a format of\n\nyyyy-mm-dd\n\nby doing the following:\n\n Setting the\n **Search\u00a0Value**\n field to\n\n\n`([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})`\n\n\n This regular expression searches for values, storing them in variables with 4 digits, 2 digits, and 2 digits (for dates in the form\n\nyyyymmdd\n\n).\n* Setting the\n **Replace\u00a0With**\n field to\n\n\n`$1-$2-$3`\n\n\n This regular expression replaces the variables ($1, $2, $3) found in the\n **Search String**\n regular expression, resulting in the\n\n$1-$2-$3\n\nformat for dates in the form\n\nyyy-mm-dd\n\n.\n\nWorkbench 5 includes a Regular Expression Builder to help you construct regular expressions for your\u00a0\"Search\" value and/or \"Replace with\" value. You can open the Regular Expression Builder by clicking the ellipsis (...) to the right of the\n **Include filter**\n field. In the Builder, you can\u00a0select from a wide variety of constructs to use in your\u00a0search or replacement\u00a0string. These constructs are divided into categories for easy navigation (grouping constructs, character escapes, substitutions, etc.). Descriptions are provided for each construct.\n\n*To replace a value in a column,**\n\n. In Workbench, click\n\nin the left-hand icon bar.\n2. In the Jobs listing, double-click\u00a0the DataSet job with column values you want to replace.\n3. Click\n **Transforms**\n to expand that section of the pane.\n4. In the\n **Add a transform**\n menu, select\n **Search/Replace Transform**\n .\n5. Click the\n\nbutton.\n\n\n The\n **Search/Replace Transform Editor**\n appears.\n6. In the\n **Search Column**\n menu, select the column in which you want to replace values.\n7. In the\n **Search Value**\n field, enter the value you want to replace or insert a regular expression using the Regular Expression Builder.\n8. In the\n **Replace With**\n field, enter the value that should replace the value you entered in step 7 or insert a regular expression using the Regular Expression Builder.\n9. (Optional) In the\n **Alternate Replace**\n field, specify a default value to appear in cells in which your search value does not appear.\n10. Click\n ****Apply****\n .\n11. Click\n\nat the top of the pane to save your transform.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043437433\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004835\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nReplacing a Column Value in Workbench 5\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,820\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:31 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "replacing_a_column_value_in_workbench_5", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_5", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapTGAS"}]}
