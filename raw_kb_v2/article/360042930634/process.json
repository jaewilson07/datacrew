To learn more about the Openfire API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://www.igniterealtime.org/proje...pi/readme.html\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Openfire account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Openfire connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Openfire account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The hostname or IP address where the Openfire database is stored.\n* The port number used to communicate with the database.\n* The database name.\n* The credentials (username and password) for the account.\n* The certificate key for the Openfire database.\n\nYou must also whitelist\u00a0a number of IP address as described in\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Openfire Account\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Openfire Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Openfire account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Hostname\n  |\n Enter the hostname or IP address of the Openfire server.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number used to communicate with the database.\n  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the Openfire database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your Openfire username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your Openfire password.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Key\n  |\n Enter your certificate key for the database.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Openfire credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Openfire DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains only a single field where you enter your SQL query.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n SQL Statement\n  |\n Enter the Openfire SQL query you want to retrieve data for.\n\n\n For example:\n\nSELECT \\* FROM ofPresence\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930634\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003398\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nOpenfire Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,342\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "openfire_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
