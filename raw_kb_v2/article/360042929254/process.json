With both options, you can choose whether the dates in the range are specific or relative. If you choose specific dates, you are prompted to choose those dates in a date picker.

We can only display your custom metrics/dimensions if you have one web property selected. Only views within the web property can use its custom metric/dimension. You can have as many views selected as you want as long as they belong to the same web property. The custom metrics and dimensions (if there are any) will be displayed under the \"Custom Variables or Columns\" section under the custom report.\n                       \n\n                        How do segments work?\n                       \n\n                        A segment is a subset of your Analytics data. For example, of your entire set of users \u00a0one segment might be users from a particular country or city. Within Domo, when you select multiple segments, we query a report for each segment you have selected. You can use custom segments.

That way whenever you add or delete a view, you won't have to update the DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        Why am I limited to 10 metrics and 7 dimensions?\n                       \n\n                        This is a limitation given by the Google Analytics API. There is no way to add more than 10 metrics and 7 dimensions to a report.\n                       \n\n                        My data is not aggregated in the way I expect. Why is that?\n                       \n\n                        Google returns sampled data when your data passes the threshold of 500k sessions at the property level for the date range you are using. (For more about sampled data and how Google handles it, see\n                        \n                         About Data Sampling\n                        \n\n                         .\n                        \n\n\n                        If Google returns sampled data, and your connector configuration does not \"Allow Sampled Data\", then:\n                       \n\n\n                         Domo rejects the sampled data\n                        \n\n                         Domo breaks up the request into smaller date intervals.\n                        \n\n                         Google responds to these smaller requests with unsampled data. This data will be aggregated with the time dimension of the smaller date interval, not the time dimension of the overall report.\n                        \n\n\n                        For example, you might have a custom report aggregated with a time dimension of Month of the year (ga:month). If your data passes the threshold of 500k sessions, Google will return sampled data. Domo will reject the sampled data and instead request data for January 1-15. Google will return unsampled data that is aggregated for January 1-15. The process will repeat for the data for January 16 -31.\n                        \n\n                        It is your responsibility to handle the non-aggregated data with an ETL.\n                        \n\n                        To avoid this, either configure the dataset to Allow Sampled Data, or aggregate the data with a time dimension of Date (ga:date) or smaller.\n                       \n\n                        Troubleshooting\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Check user permission settings if you are having trouble gaining access to data.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Check to make sure you are using the correct set of credentials.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          When validating data between the API data and the front end reporting tool, always check to see if the data was sampled or not.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042929254", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
