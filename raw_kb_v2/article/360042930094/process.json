This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Twitter\u00a0Engagement connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nBecause this connector uses the Twitter Engagement API, one of Twitter\u2019s Enterprise-level APIs,\u00a0your business will need to sign a contract with Twitter to use this API. See\n\nTwitter Enterprise data\n\nfor more information and to set up a contract with Twitter to access this API.\n\n\n To connect to your Twitter app and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n A Twitter consumer key\n* A Twitter consumer secret\n\nThese credentials are associated with the Twitter app you created at\n\nhttps://developer.twitter.com\n\n. For more information, see\n\nhttps://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens\n\n.\n\n\n When you create your Twitter app, you will need to enter the following redirect URIs:\n\n https://oauth.dev.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/twitter-engagement/callback\n* https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/twitter-engagement/callback\n\nConnecting to your Twitter app\n--------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Twitter\u00a0Engagement Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Twitter account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Consumer Key\n  |\n Enter the consumer key associated with your Twitter app.\n  |\n|\n Consumer Secret\n  |\n Enter the consumer secret associated with your Twitter app.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Twitter\u00a0Engagement DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus and options.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Twitter\u00a0Engagement report you want to run.\u00a0Currently only a single report is available.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Historical Engagement\n  |\n Return engagement metrics broken down by Tweet, engagement type, date, and/or hour of the day.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Tweet Selection\n  |\n Select whether you want to retrieve a specified number of recent tweets to retrieve data for or manually select the tweets.\n  |\n|\n Number of Tweets\n  |\n Enter the number of recent tweets you want to retrieve.\n  |\n|\n Tweets\n  |\n Select the tweets you want to retrieve data for.
