Flurry is a mobile analytics platform that measures mobile app performance for various mobile platforms.

For more information about the Flurry API, visit their website. (

https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/api/

)

The Flurry connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

You connect to your Flurry account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Flurry connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
----------------


 To connect to your Flurry account and create a DataSet, you must have a Flurry Programmatic Access Token. You can obtain an access code by navigating to

https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/d...code/apptoken/

and following the instructions.


 Connecting to Your Flurry Account
------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Flurry Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


###

Credentials Pane


 This pane contains a single field where you enter your Flurry API Access Code.  For information about obtaining this code, see "Prerequisites," above.


 Once you have entered a valid Access Code, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Flurry DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.
