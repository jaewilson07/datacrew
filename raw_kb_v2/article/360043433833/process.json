(\n\nhttps://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/api/\n\n)\n\nThe Flurry connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your\u00a0Flurry account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Flurry\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0Flurry account and create a DataSet, you must have a Flurry Programmatic Access Token. You can obtain an access code by navigating to\n\nhttps://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/d...code/apptoken/\n\nand following the instructions.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Flurry\u00a0Account\n------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Flurry\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a single field where you enter your Flurry API Access Code.\u00a0\u00a0For information about obtaining this code, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n\n\n Once you have entered a valid Access Code, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Flurry DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu in which you select a report type.\n\n\n|\n\nMenu\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nReport\n\n|\n\nSelect a Flurry report.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n App Events\n  |\n Returns application events-related data.\n  |\n|\n App Event Parameters\n  |\n Returns application event parameters data.\n  |\n|\n App Usage\n  |\n Returns application usage related data.\n  |\n|\n Publisher History\n  |\n Returns up to 400 days worth of publishing daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly data.\n  |\n|\n Publisher Recent\n  |\n Returns\u00a0up to 15 days of the most recent hourly or daily data.\n  |\n|\n Real Time\n  |\n Returns an application's recent data.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Metrics\n  |\n Select all of the metrics you want to show in your report.\n  |\n|\n Having (Optional)\n  |\n Enter criteria to filter metrics data in your report.\u00a0You can combine multiple metrics criteria. The format is\n\nmetric-operator[value(s)].\n\nAvailable operators are:\n\nequal(eq)\n\n,\n\ngreaterThan(gt)\n\n,\n\nlessThan(lt)\n\nFor example:\n\n\n`sessions-gt[1000],activeDevices-gt[200]`\n\n\n This essentially filters your report to show \"Sessions\" values that are greater than 1000 and \"Active Devices\" values greater than 200.\n  |\n|\n Dimensions\n  |\n Select all of the dimensions you want to show in your report.\n  |\n|\n Dimension Filters (Optional)\n  |\n Enter criteria to filter dimensions data in your report.\u00a0You can combine multiple dimensions criteria. Some dimensions have additional attributes referred to in the\n **Dimensions**\n field.The format is\n\ndimension1|attribute-operator[value(s)]\n\n. Operators include the following:\n * in\n* notin\n* contains\n* startsWith\n\n\n Example:\n\ncountry|name-in['United States','Canada','Mexico'],appVersion|name-in['2.3']\n\n|\n|\n Time Grains\n  |\n Select whether you want your report data to be aggregated by day, month, week, or all. Intervals must align to the time grain specified in the query. The Flurry connector automatically adjusts the dates to match the interval selected.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Month\n  |\n First of the month for both start and end period\n  |\n|\n Week\n  |\n Dates for Monday of the week for corresponding start and end periods.\n  |\n|\n Quarter\n  |\n Quarter must start and end on the 1st day of the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 10th month of a year.\n  |\n|\n Year\n  |\n Year must start on January 1st and end on January 1st.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0last date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Application\n  |\n Select all platforms/applications you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n|\n Event Name\n  |\n Select the event you want to retrieve data for.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n####\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nNo.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433833\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003528\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nFlurry Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,641\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "flurry_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
