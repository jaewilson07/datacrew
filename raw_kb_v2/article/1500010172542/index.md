 FAQ's
-------

*I’m noticing some slight differences between how the cards appear in the mobile preview on the web vs. mobile.**


 The mobile preview on the web will serve as a very close approximation of what the cards actually look like on mobile. However, due to the different sizing of different mobile devices, there might be very slight differences in the amount of visible content. This is expected.


**Why can’t I drag cards in the mobile editor from the appendix?**


 In order for a card to be rearranged in the mobile layout, it must not be in the appendix.


**Can I place a card in the layout on the web version but in the appendix section on mobile?**


 No, the card must be in a layout in order to be customized in the mobile layout.


**How do I get into the card details view on a mobile device?**


 Just like on the web, tapping on the card's title will take you into the Card Details view.
