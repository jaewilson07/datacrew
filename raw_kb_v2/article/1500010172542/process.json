However, due to the different sizing of different mobile devices, there might be very slight differences in the amount of visible content. This is expected.\n\n\n**Why can\u2019t I drag cards in the mobile editor from the appendix?**\n\n\n In order for a card to be rearranged in the mobile layout, it must not be in the appendix.\n\n\n**Can I place a card in the layout on the web version but in the appendix section on mobile?**\n\n\n No, the card must be in a layout in order to be customized in the mobile layout.\n\n\n**How do I get into the card details view on a mobile device?**\n\n\n Just like on the web, tapping on the card's title will take you into the Card Details view.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500010172542\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004321\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nEditing a Dashboard's Mobile Layout\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,971\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:36 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "editing_a_dashboards_mobile_layout", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "getting_to_know_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamsGAC"}, {"text": "domo_mobile", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZancGAC"}]}
