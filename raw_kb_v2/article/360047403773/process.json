Workbench may continue to run on installed machines, but it will no longer receive feature enhancements and security updates. When issues are encountered in Workbench 4, the recommended course of action from the Domo Support team will be to upgrade to the latest version of Workbench 5. To see this article for Workbench 5, click\n\n*here**\n\n.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nIn the Workbench application, you can\u00a0connect to your Domo server; configure\u00a0settings for creating DataSet Jobs; import and export job files; preview, schedule, validate, and run jobs; etc.\n\n\n This topic discusses\u00a0the user interface\u00a0components of Workbench.\n\n\n Workbench Interface\n---------------------\n\nThe following screenshot\u00a0points out the\u00a0main sections of the Workbench user interface. These sections are discussed in more detail throughout the remainder of this topic.\n\nThe following table describes the sections pointed out in the preceding screenshot:\n\n\n Section\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Accounts\u00a0pane\n  |\n Lists all\u00a0connected accounts. For each account, you can access\n **Logs**\n and\n **Settings**\n options, along with all of the DataSet Jobs associated with the account.\u00a0For each DataSet Job, you can access options such as\n **Settings**\n ,\n **Schedule**\n ,\n **Transforms**\n , etc.\u00a0Clicking an item in the\n **Accounts**\n pane opens information or options for that item in the Dynamic Options pane in the center of the\u00a0application. For example, selecting\n **Settings > Account**\n for a particular account would open options for configuring this account in the Options pane.\n\n\n You can move\u00a0the\n **Accounts**\n pane anywhere on the screen by clicking on the pushpin icon in the top corner of the pane and dragging the pane.\n\n\n For more information about adding accounts, see\n\nAdding an Account in Workbench 4\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Buttons toolbar\n  |\n Provide access to various Workbench options.\u00a0Buttons are divided across two tabs\u2014\n **Home**\n and\n **More**\n . The\n **Home**\n tab provides options for\u00a0working with accounts,\u00a0DataSet jobs, and transforms. The\n **More**\n tab provides options for getting help with Workbench, such as accessing online help, opening help videos, viewing log files, etc., and also provides access to the\u00a0Plugin Manager.\n  |\n|\n Job status pane\n  |\n Provides you with\u00a0insights around when jobs are being run and allows\u00a0you\u00a0to make changes, pause, cancel and run jobs.\n  |\n|\n Dynamic Options\u00a0pane\n  |\n Provides information and/or options depending on the item currently selected in the\n **Accounts**\n pane.\n  |\n|\n Preview/output panes\n  |\n Show preview and output information for\u00a0a DataSet job. These panes are not populated until you click\n **Preview**\n for\u00a0a DataSet job in the buttons toolbar at the top of the screen.\u00a0A tab for the DataSet job is then added to both the\n **Preview**\n and\n **Output**\n panes. If you click\n **Preview**\n for\u00a0another DataSet job,\u00a0separate\u00a0tabs for that job are added to the\n **Preview**\n and\n **Output**\n panes.\n  |\n\nButtons toolbar\n-----------------\n\nThe options in the Buttons toolbar provide various functions within Workbench. These are organized into two tabs,\n **Home**\n and\n **More**\n . You can switch between these by clicking\n **Home**\n or\n **More**\n at the top of the window.\n\n##\n Home buttons\n\nThe buttons in the\n **Home**\n tab provide options for working with accounts, DataSet Jobs, and transforms.\n\n\n Button\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Add New (Account)\n  |\n Opens the account creation wizard so you can add a new server account to your Workbench.

Typically, log files are located in\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\DomoWorkbench\n\n. You can open log (\n\n.txt\n\n) files in a text editor.\n\n\n Log files for manual or scheduled jobs are named based on the job (\n\n.xml\n\n) filename and the date:\n\nmyjob\\_yyyy-mm-dd\n\n.\n\n\n Log entries for jobs run at the command line are named based on the application name and the date:\n\nDomoWorkbench\\_yyyy-mm-dd\n\n. For more information about running Workbench from the command line, see\n\nRunning Workbench 4 from the command line\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Wiki\n  |\n Opens\u00a0Domo's Workbench help documentation.\n  |\n|\n Community\n  |\n Opens\u00a0the Workbench help forum.\n  |\n|\n Videos\n  |\n Opens training videos for Workbench.\n  |\n|\n Plugins\n  |\n Opens the Plugin Manager. Here you can see existing plugins by category and add new plugins for use in Workbench. For more information, see\n\nManaging Plugins in Workbench 4\n\n.\n  |\n\nAccounts pane\n---------------\n\nIn the\n **Accounts**\n pane, you can view logs, edit\u00a0settings, and access DataSet Job options for individual accounts.\u00a0Clicking any item in this list (except for top-level accounts) opens information and/or options in the Dynamic Options panel in the center of Workbench.\n\n\n Items in\u00a0this pane are laid out\u00a0in a tree structure with five levels of navigation, with accounts\u00a0on the topmost level. Each account includes the following branches, which make up the second level of navigation:\n **Logs**\n ,\n **Settings**\n , and\n **DataSet Jobs**\n .\n **Settings**\n includes three sub-branches\u2014\n **Account**\n ,\n **Proxy**\n , and\n **Updates,**\n and\n **DataSet Jobs**\n includes a sub-branch for each DataSet job associated with this account; these make up the third level of navigation.\u00a0For each job sub-branch, these options are available:\n **Settings**\n ,\n **Schedule**\n ,\n **Source**\n ,\n **Schema**\n ,\n **Transforms**\n ,\n **Notifications**\n ,\u00a0and\n **Logs**\n (fourth level). In addition,\n **Transforms**\n may include one or more sub-branches of its own (fifth level).\n\n\n The following screenshot shows\u00a0an example of this tree structure:\n\nA\n\nto the left of a list item indicates that there are items hidden beneath it; click the icon to expand those items. Click\n\nto the left of an item to collapse the items beneath that item.\n\n\n You can drag the\n **Accounts**\n pane anywhere you want it in the Workbench interface. When you drag the pane, arrow buttons appear, indicating the top, bottom, left side, and right side of the interface. If you drag the pane onto one of these buttons, the corresponding area of the interface is highlighted. Dropping the pane onto a button causes it to be \"docked\" in the corresponding area. For example, if you dropped the pane onto\u00a0either up arrow, it would dock in the upper portion of the\u00a0Workbench window.\n\n*Note:**\n A pane must be in Dock mode\u00a0to be draggable. To put a pane in Dock mode, click the\u00a0sideways pushpin icon\n\n. This allows you to drag it\u00a0and dock it.\n\n\n###\n Jobs List\n\nYou can open the jobs list view by clicking\n **View Jobs List**\n just above the status panel. This list view\u00a0allows\u00a0you to\u00a0search\u00a0and sort\u00a0DataSet jobs, see upcoming schedules, and organize jobs by status,\u00a0giving better visibility into jobs to facilitate job management\u00a0in an instance.\n\n\n###\n Logs\n\nWhen you click\n **Logs**\n for a given account, the logs for that account are shown in the Dynamic Options panel.\n\nLog information is shown chronologically in reverse. You can show the logs for any day by clicking in the\n **Log Date**\n menu and selecting the desired date from the date picker. You can sort the logs in chronological or reverse chronological order. You can also filter logs by error level (\n\nERROR\n\n,\n\nINFO\n\n, or\n\nWARN\n\n).\n\n##\n Settings\n\nIn\n **Settings**\n , you\u00a0can\u00a0see a\u00a0connection summary, change your\u00a0account\u00a0information,\u00a0configure proxy settings, and set your update URL and frequency.\u00a0You can access settings options by clicking\n **Settings**\n or any of its subtabs in the pane on the left side of Workbench. (Note that there are two\n **Settings**\n items available in the\n **Accounts**\n pane. The version of\n **Settings**\n discussed here refers to the one on the 2nd level of navigation, located under\n **Logs**\n . These settings are used to configure account and connection details in your Workbench, while the settings discussed later on are specific to DataSet Jobs.)\n\n###\n Connection summary\n\nClick\n **Settings**\n to see a summary of your connection information, including your agent ID, Domo server, job check frequency, proxy, and software update settings.\n\n\n####\n Account\u00a0tab\n\nLets you\u00a0edit your connection information for Domo.\n\nYou can refer to the following table to find out more about the components in this tab:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Server\n  |\n The URL for the connected server, which you specify when you set up your Workbench account.\n  |\n|\n API Key\n  |\n The API key for the account to use in connecting to Domo. You can generate a new API key by clicking the arrow on the right side of the field, entering your email address and password, and clicking\n **Create Token**\n .\n  |\n|\n Ignore Certificate Errors\n  |\n If turned on, certificate errors are ignored when connecting to this server.\n\n\n |\n|\n Test\u00a0Connection\n  |\n Lets you test the provided connection credentials.\n  |\n|\n Check for new DataSet Job every\n  |\n Specifies the frequency at which Workbench checks to see if DataSet Jobs\u00a0need to be processed. Units range from\n **Seconds**\n to\n **Years**\n . Set\n **Never**\n if you don't want Workbench to check for unprocessed jobs.\n  |\n|\n Limit Concurrent Jobs\n  |\n Lets you limit the number of DataSet Jobs that may run at the same time.\n  |\n|\n Only run locally managed jobs\n  |\n If checked, Workbench runs only DataSet Jobs\u00a0managed locally,\n *not*\n those on networks.\n  |\n|\n Require impersonation credentials for all jobs (Workbench 4.5 only)\n  |\n If checked, Workbench requests non-default\u00a0credentials for all DataSet\u00a0Jobs (that is, the\n **Requires Impersonation**\n toggle for all Jobs is turned off and cannot be switched back on). This option is only available if you have administrator privileges.\n  |\n\n\n####\n Proxy\u00a0tab\n\nLets you specify settings for more securely connecting to Domo using a proxy server.\n\n*Note:**\n When you initially connect to Domo via Workbench, Workbench leverages your Windows system proxy settings; you cannot enter your proxy settings manually at this time. However, after you connect to Domo for the first time, you can manually configure the proxy settings in the\n **Proxy**\n tab.\n\n\n You can refer to the following table to find out more about the components in this tab:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n No Proxy Server\n  |\n Does\n *not*\n use a proxy server to connect.\n  |\n|\n Automatically Detect Proxy Settings\n  |\n Determines your proxy settings automatically.\n  |\n|\n Manual Proxy Configuration\n  |\n Lets you manually specify the proxy server information to use in connecting. You can do this only after initially connecting to Domo via Workbench. (The first time you connect, your system proxy settings are used.)\n\n\n Enter the server address and port.\n\n\n If the proxy server requires credentials, set\n **Requires Authentication**\n to\n **On**\n , then specify the username and password.\n  |\n|\n Use System Proxy Settings (Workbench 4.5 only)\n  |\n Determines your proxy settings based on your system proxy settings.\n  |\n\nAfter you enter proxy credentials, you can test your connection by clicking\n **Test Proxy**\n . The color of the\u00a0icon next to this button indicates whether the proxy settings have been validated.\n\n###\n Updates tab\n\nLets you specify how Workbench software updates are handled.\n\nYou can refer to the following table to find out more about the components in this tab:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Workbench\u00a0Update URL\n  |\n Specifies the URL that is to be used for Workbench software updates.\n  |\n|\n When to Check for Software Updates\n  |\n Specifies how frequently\u00a0Workbench should check for software updates. Units range from\u00a0minutes to years.\n\n\n Select\n **Never**\n if you don't want Workbench to check for software updates.\n  |\n|\n Install updates automatically\n  |\n When turned on, Workbench\u00a0software is updated automatically.\n  |\n\n\n###\n DataSet Jobs\n\nIn the\n **DataSet Jobs**\n section of the\n **Accounts**\n pane, you can access information and options for all\u00a0DataSet Jobs that have\u00a0been created in your Workbench instance.\n\n\n When you click\n **DataSet Jobs**\n , a summary of all your created jobs appears in the Dynamic Options pane. Each summary shows the job ID, DataSet name, creation date, dates of the last run and the next scheduled run, and a message. Jobs in a healthy state are shown with green circles; jobs in an unhealthy state are shown with orange circles.\n\nWhen you click a job (i.e. the job name, not any of the options beneath it in the hierarchy), details about the job and its execution history open in the\n **Dynamic Options**\n pane. The following screenshot shows the job details for a DataSet Job named \"Europe Sales\":\n\nRight-clicking the name of a DataSet Job provides quick access to a number of options also available in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window, namely\n **Preview DataSet Job**\n (which also sends\u00a0an output log to the\n **Output**\n pane, like the\n **Preview**\n button),\n **Execute DataSet Job**\n ,\n **Delete DataSet Job**\n , and\n **Export DataSet Job**\n .\n\nWhen a DataSet Job name appears in italics with an asterisk, this indicates that unsaved changes have been made to the job settings.\n\n\n Each DataSet Job includes a number of\u00a0parameters that are shown beneath the job name in the hierarchy in the\n **Accounts**\n pane. Clicking a parameter\u00a0opens information and/or options for that parameter in the Dynamic Options pane. For example, clicking the\n **Schedule**\n parameter\u00a0for the \"Europe Sales\" DataSet job would open\u00a0an interface\u00a0with options for setting\u00a0the run schedule for that job.\n\n\n The following table lists and describes the\u00a0parameters available for each job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane. These are all described in greater detail in continuation.\n\n\n Parameter\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Settings\n  |\n Lets you configure the DataSet Job name,\u00a0the DataSet type,\u00a0the\u00a0destination DataSet,\u00a0update method, error handling, and additional settings.\n  |\n|\n Schedule\n  |\n Lets you configure how often this\u00a0DataSet is updated.\n  |\n|\n Source\n  |\n Lets you configure\u00a0settings for your source DataSet\u2014transport method, credentials, data source properties, etc.\n  |\n|\n Schema\n  |\n Shows\u00a0the schema\u00a0for your DataSet (but only appears after you\u00a0click\n **Preview**\n for the\u00a0job). Here you can rename destination columns, change the data type, and include or exclude columns.\n  |\n|\n Transforms\n  |\n Lets you edit all\u00a0transforms that have been added to this DataSet Job.\n  |\n|\n Notifications\n  |\n Lets you configure notifications for individual users in Domo.\n  |\n|\n Logs\n  |\n Shows\u00a0all of the logs for this\u00a0DataSet Job.\n  |\n\n\n####\n Settings\n\nWhen you select\n **Settings**\n for a DataSet job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane, options for configuring settings for the job appear in the Dynamic Options pane. (Note that there are two\n **Settings**\n items available in the\n **Accounts**\n pane. The version of\n **Settings**\n discussed here refers to the one found under the DataSet Jobs heading and is specific to the selected DataSet Job.)\n\nThe following table describes the options available in the\n **Settings**\n for a DataSet job:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Name\n  |\n The name of this job. You initially name a job when you create it in the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**\n , but you can rename it here.\n  |\n|\n Domo DataSet\n  |\n The DataSet\u00a0generated by Workbench in Domo, i.e. the destination\u00a0data source. A\u00a0blue \"i\"\u00a0next to the DataSet name indicates that the DataSet has not yet been created in Domo.\n  |\n|\n Update Method\n  |\n Determines whether new data replaces or is appended to the DataSet when updating.\n  |\n|\n DataSet Type\n  |\n The type of DataSet as shown in Domo.\u00a0You can select a type from the menu or enter a custom name.\n\n\n The DataSet type\u00a0you select or enter here is for informational purposes in Domo only. For example, you might be connecting to an ODBC\u00a0database that contains Twitter data.\u00a0In this case the best option would be to enter\u00a0\"Twitter\" rather than selecting\n **ODBC**\n because the data you are representing in Domo is from Twitter.\n  |\n|\n DataSet Description\n  |\n The description for this DataSet\u00a0you entered when you went through the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**\n . You can edit the description here.\n  |\n|\n Disable Job\n  |\n Prevents this job from executing.\n  |\n|\n Error Handling\n  |\n Determines what happens when errors are encountered in a DataSet Job. Options include the following:\n * Replace invalid cells with NULL value\n\nWhen invalid cells are encountered, the values are replaced with a \"NULL\" value.\n* Skip entire row if it contains invalid cell(s)\n\nWhen invalid cells are encountered, the rows in which they are found are skipped.\n* Abort Job on invalid data error\n\nWhen invalid cells are encountered, the entire DataSet Job is aborted.\n |\n|\n Requires Impersonation\n  |\n Used when you need to authenticate using non-default credentials. New to 4.5, if an admin user checked the box for\n **Require impersonation credentials for all jobs**\n under\n **Settings > Account**\n , this option is turned on by default and cannot be turned off.\n  |\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Specifies the domain when you are authenticating using non-default credentials (impersonation).\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Specifies your username\u00a0when you are authenticating using non-default credentials (impersonation).\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Specifies your password when you are authenticating using non-default credentials (impersonation).\n  |\n|\n Terminate\u00a0job if it runs longer than\n  |\n Lets you specify a time frame (in hours) in which a long-running job is to be terminated.\n  |\n|\n Upload even if data hasn't changed\n  |\n Lets you upload data to Domo even though the data has not changed. Useful when you want the DataSet freshness in Domo to be updated.\n  |\n|\n Clear Domo DataSet if DataSet Job returns\u00a0zero rows\n  |\n Lets you clear the DataSet in Domo if zero rows are returned when a job runs. If disabled, Workbench does\n *not*\n send a command to Domo to clear out data in the DataSet. If you have a process where you want to upload data in a table after data in another table has been updated, you could disable this option and add some script in your query that looks at the \"status\" table, running the query if the data is ready.\n  |\n|\n Allow schema changes\n  |\n Allows schema changes to be pushed to Domo\u00a0when the job is left unattended.\n  |\n|\n Wait for Adrenaline Indexing (Workbench 4.5 only)\n  |\n Tells Workbench to wait for Adrenaline indexing (Domo indexing data in the cloud)\u00a0after a DataSet Job uploads. If this\u00a0option is turned off, Workbench marks the job as successful immediately after an upload.\n  |\n\n\n####\n Schedule\n\nWhen you select\n **Schedule**\n for a DataSet Job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane, options for\u00a0scheduling updates for the job appear in the Dynamic Options pane.\n\nIn the\n **Schedule Type**\n menu you select the type of schedule\u00a0you want.\n\n\n In the\n **Update**\n menu you select the\u00a0update frequency for this DataSet Job. Options range from\n **Every 30 Minutes**\n to\n **Every Month**\n . If you select\n **Manually**\n , the DataSet does\n *not*\n update on a schedule; you must\u00a0run the DataSet Job yourself from within Workbench.\u00a0If you select\n **Watch File**\n , this DataSet Job will run every time the file is updated.\n\n\n For more information about updating a DataSet, see\n\nUpdating or Refreshing the DataSet for a Visualization Card\n\n.\n\n\n When you select a frequency in the menu, the next four upcoming update times are shown at the bottom of the\u00a0Options pane.\n\n\n For more information about setting a schedule, see\n\nScheduling a Job in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n\n You can also create a group of DataSet Jobs that share the same update schedule. For more information, see\n\nCreating a Schedule Group in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n###\n Source\n\nWhen you select\n **Source**\n for a DataSet Job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane, options for configuring the transport method and data source for the job appear in the Dynamic Options pane.\n\n####\n Transport Method\n\nTransport methods determine how data sources are brought into Workbench. You select a transport method in the\n **Workbench DataSet Job Creation Wizard**\n and configure options for the selected method in\u00a0the\n **Source**\n pane for the DataSet Job.\u00a0Options are different for each transport method.\n\n#####\n Local File Provider\n\nThe\n **Local File Provider**\n transport method lets you select a file from your machine or a network. This method is used for transporting\n\nXML\n\ndata sources into Domo.\n\n\n The following screenshot shows the options available when this method is selected:\n\nYou can use the following table to learn more about these options:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n File Path\n  |\n Specifies the file path for the local file you want to pull into Workbench.\n  |\n|\n Network Username/Password\n  |\n Specifies the username and password for the network the file is located on, if any.\n  |\n|\n Validate Configuration\n  |\n Lets you validate the transport settings you have configured.\n  |\n\n\n######\n SFTP File Provider\n\nUse the SFTP File Provider transport method\u00a0when you\u00a0want to retrieve a file via FTP, SFTP (SSH-FTP) or FTPS (FTP-SSL). This method is used for transporting\n\nXML\n\ndata sources into Domo.\n\n\n The following screenshot shows the options available when this method is selected:\n\nYou can use the following table to learn more about these options:\n\n\n Option\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Server\n  |\n Specifies the server URL for your FTP server.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Specifies your username for connecting to the server.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Specifies your password for connecting to the server.\n  |\n|\n Protocol\n  |\n Determines whether you are retrieving data via FTP, SFTP, or FTPS.\n  |\n|\n Host Key Fingerprint (SSL Certificate Settings)\n  |\n Specifies the host key fingerprint for your SSL certificate, if one is required.

You can\u00a0choose to have Workbench return matches or non-matches for the specified filter query. You can also include or exclude blank cells in your\u00a0filtered data.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nFiltering Columns in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n####\n Lookup Table\n\nYou can combine data sources in Workbench by using Lookup Tables.\u00a0A \"Lookup Table\" is a DataSet you combine with a primary DataSet.\u00a0The Lookup Table DataSet and primary DataSet must both contain one column with unique matching values (\"key columns\"). Once you match key columns, a new DataSet is created by joining all columns from both DataSets. Combining DataSets\u00a0in this way\u00a0is equivalent to using a LEFT JOIN in SQL.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCombining DataSets in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n####\n Shift Date Timezone\n\nWith the\n **Shift Date Timezone**\n transform, you can set the time zone for\u00a0the data in a data source by selecting your desired time zone from a menu.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nSetting the Time Zone for a Workbench 4 Job\n\n.\n\n####\n Encrypt\n\nYou can use the\n **Encrypt**\n transform to encrypt one or more columns of data in your data source. After the DataSet has been pulled into Domo, it can only be decrypted in a Sumo table, by users who have been given special access in the\n **User Access**\n listing for the DataSet job in Workbench. For more information about Sumo, see\n\nUnderstanding Sumo cards\n\n.\n\nFor more information about encryption and decryption, see\n\nEncrypting and Decrypting Workbench 4 Data\n\n.\n\n####\n Search &\u00a0Replace\n\nYou can use the\n **Search & Replace**\n transform to replace a\u00a0specified value in a column with another value. You can also specify a default value to appear in cells in which your search value does not appear. For search and replace values you can open a regular expression builder that includes a number of categories of regular expression constructs.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nReplacing a Column Value in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n###\n Notifications\n\nWhen you select\n **Notifications**\n for a DataSet job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane, options for\u00a0configuring notifications\u00a0for the job appear in the Dynamic Options pane.\u00a0Here you can specify who in your Domo instance is notified when jobs are completed successfully and/or fail. For any user in your instance, you can specify whether he/she is notified\u00a0upon job\u00a0success, failure, or both.\u00a0You can also filter the rows in any column as well as set up custom filters. For more information about notifications, see\n\nSetting Notifications in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n\n####\n Logs\n\nWhen you select\n **Logs**\n for a DataSet job in the\n **Accounts**\n pane (as opposed to selecting the\n **Logs**\n option\u00a0at the top of the\n **Accounts**\n pane, which opens the logs for\u00a0the account), you can view the logs for that DataSet job in the Dynamic Options pane. For each log item, you can see the process ID, the\u00a0thread ID, the error level (either \"Info\" or \"Error\"), the\u00a0timestamp, and the log\u00a0message. You can select logs for any day you want using\u00a0a date picker. You can also sort logs in ascending or descending timestamp order\u00a0of filter by error level (\n\nERROR\n\n,\n\nINFO\n\n, or\n\nWARN\n\n).\n\nDynamic Options pane\n----------------------\n\nIn the\u00a0Dynamic Options pane, you can\u00a0configure options for DataSet jobs.\u00a0The options available in this pane update according to what you select in the\n **Accounts**\n pane.\u00a0Unlike the other panes in Workbench, this pane cannot be moved.\n\n\n Preview and Output panes\n--------------------------\n\nThe\n **Preview**\n and\n **Output**\n panes provide information about a selected DataSet job. The\n **Preview**\n pane shows a preview of what the DataSet looks like with all of the settings you have applied, and the\n **Output**\n pane provides a log of actions taken as the\u00a0preview is loaded. Nothing appears in either pane until you\u00a0click\n **Preview**\n in the Buttons toolbar at the top of the Workbench window. If you\u00a0click\n **Preview**\n for more than one DataSet job, tabs for each job appear in the\n **Preview**\n and\n **Output**\n panes. The following screenshot shows an example of this, where the user has enabled previews for\u00a0the DataSet jobs \"Monthly Sales Data\" and \"Revenue2012\":\n\nPreview and output data is lost when you close Workbench.\n\n\n By default, the\n **Preview**\n and\n **Output**\n panes are located side by side\u00a0in the bottom left corner of the Workbench window. Mousing over a pane\u00a0causes it to pop open for viewing; if you move the cursor away from a pane, it closes, but you can force it to stay open by clicking anywhere\u00a0on it.\n\n\n You can drag the\n **Preview**\n and\n **Output**\n panes\u00a0anywhere you want it in the Workbench interface. When you drag\u00a0a pane, arrow buttons appear, indicating the top, bottom, left side, and right side of the interface. If you drag the pane onto one of these buttons, the corresponding area of the interface is highlighted. Dropping the pane onto a button causes it to be \"docked\" in the corresponding area. For example, if you dropped the pane onto\u00a0either up arrow, it would dock in the upper portion of the\u00a0Workbench window.\n\n*Note:**\n A pane must be in Dock mode\u00a0to be draggable. To put a pane in Dock mode, click the\u00a0sideways pushpin icon\n\n. This allows you to drag it\u00a0and dock it.\n\nDataSet Job Groups Wizard\n---------------------------\n\nIn\u00a0the\n **DataSet Job Groups Wizard**\n , you can\u00a0select any number of DataSet jobs to run on the same schedule.\u00a0After selecting DataSet jobs for a schedule group,\u00a0Windows Task Scheduler opens and you can set up scheduling for the jobs in the group there. You can also use\u00a0the\n **DataSet Job Groups Wizard**\n to\u00a0edit your existing groups. For more information about managing groups, see\n\nCreating a Schedule Group in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n\n Plugin Manager\n----------------\n\nIn the\n **Plugin Manager**\n , you can view all of the plugins in Workbench 4, with their names, publishers, version numbers, descriptions, and assembly names. You can add a plugin to your registered plugins list\u00a0by entering a search path.\n\nTo access the\n **Plugin Manager**\n , click\n **Plugin Manager**\n in the\n **More**\n tab\u00a0at the top of the Workbench window.\n\n\n For more information about managing plugins, see\n\nManaging Plugins in Workbench 4\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360047403773\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004796\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nUnderstanding the Workbench 4 User Interface\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,781\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:30 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "understanding_the_workbench_4_user_interface", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_4", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapSGAS"}]}
