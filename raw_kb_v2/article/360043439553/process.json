These names were often very long, so\u00a0users often had a difficult time\u00a0attempting to apply these columns in Card Builder and filters. Now,\u00a0column names are prepended with the DataSet name\n *only*\n when required because the names are duplicated.\u00a0Otherwise, the column names are left as is.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nCombining DataSets Using DataFusion\n\n.\n\n##\n Heat Map Improvements\n\nYou can now specify colors for ranges\u00a0in Heat Maps. By default, colors are based on the theme you select in\n **Chart Properties > Theme**\n , so until now\u00a0you could only choose a single color with different hues. Now you can choose different colors for each individual range.\n\nYou can also filter on individual items in the Details view for a\u00a0Heat Map by clicking the scale labels. For example, clicking \"Human Resources\" in the card in the previous screenshot would show the data filtered for Human Resources.\n\n\n For more information about Heat Maps, see\n\nHeat Map\n\n.\n\n##\n End of Support for Workbench 2\n\nBeginning in September,\u00a0Domo will be ending support for Workbench 2.\n\n##\n End of Support for IE9\n\nBeginning with our July release, Domo will no longer be supporting Internet Explorer 9.\n\n\n Getting Help\n--------------\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by clicking\n\n*> Help Center**\n .\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://www.domo.com/university\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\ndojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo (\n\n*> Feedback**\n ).
