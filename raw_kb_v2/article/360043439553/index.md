 New features and enhancements
--------------------------------

Features and enhancements in this release include the following:

##
 Clean Column Names in DataFusions

In previous versions of DataFusions, all column names were prepended with the name of the DataSet. These names were often very long, so users often had a difficult time attempting to apply these columns in Card Builder and filters. Now, column names are prepended with the DataSet name
 *only*
 when required because the names are duplicated. Otherwise, the column names are left as is.

##
 Heat Map Improvements

You can now specify colors for ranges in Heat Maps. By default, colors are based on the theme you select in
 **Chart Properties > Theme**
 , so until now you could only choose a single color with different hues. Now you can choose different colors for each individual range.

You can also filter on individual items in the Details view for a Heat Map by clicking the scale labels. For example, clicking "Human Resources" in the card in the previous screenshot would show the data filtered for Human Resources.
