To learn more about the Amazon S3 API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/...I/Welcome.html\n\n).\n\n\n The Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Advanced connectors are almost the same. The only difference is in how they handle multiple files\u00a0that begin with the prefix string you provide in the\n **Details**\n section of the connector. The standard Amazon S3 connector will only import the latest modified file. The Amazon S3 Advanced connector will import all files with the provided prefix, assuming they all have the same schema. However, the Amazon S3 Advanced connector will only get files modified since the last run or new files after the first run. For information about the standard version of the connector, see\n\nAmazon S3 Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The Amazon S3 Advanced connector is a \"File\" connector, meaning it retrieves files and outputs them to Domo. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other File connectors by clicking\n **File**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Amazon S3 account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon S3 Advanced connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is an excellent choice for retrieving flat files when APIs are not an option.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n N/A\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Data specialists\n* Marketing roles\n* Finance roles\n* Anyone who has data stored in S3\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than an hour if you have the correct file types in S3.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nUnderstanding the data stored in S3 and its relation to other S3 databases will be a huge asset in using this connector.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Amazon S3 account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your AWS access key. You can find this in the\n **Security Credentials**\n section of the AWS Console. Alternatively, if you are using IAM, you can find it under\n **Users**\n .\n* Your AWS secret key, which was provided when you created your access key. You can generate a new secret key in the AWS Console.\n* The name of the AWS S3 Bucket you want to retrieve files from.\n\n\n###\n Creating a User with the Proper Permissions\n\nYou must create a user with the proper permissions in the IAM Amazon Console before you can connect to S3 data in Domo.\n\n\n**To configure your user in the IAM Amazon Console,**\n\n. Add a new user, setting options as follows:\n\n1. In the\n\t **Details**\n\t pane, check the box for\n\t **Programmatic Access**\n\t under\n\t **Select AWS access type**\n\t .\n\t2. In the\n\t **Permissions**\n\t pane, select\n\t **Attach existing policies directly**\n\t , then check the box for either\n\t **AmazonS3FullAccess**\n\t or\n\t **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**\n\t .\n\n\n\t Customer-managed policies\n\t *do not work*\n\t .\n\t3. In the\n\t **Review**\n\t pane, click\n\t **Create User**\n\t .\n2. After you create your user, copy the access and secret keys to use in the\n **Credentials**\n pane in Domo.\n\nConnecting to Your Amazon S3 Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Amazon S3 Advanced Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Amazon S3 account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Access Key\n  |\n Enter your AWS access key. For information about finding your access key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Secret Key\n  |\n Enter your AWS secret key. For information about finding your secret key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Bucket\n  |\n Enter the Amazon S3 Bucket you want to pull files from.\n  |\n|\n Region\n  |\n Select the desired Amazon S3 Bucket region.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Amazon S3 credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Amazon S3 Advanced DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains various menus for locating and configuring the file you want to pull into Domo.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n File Type to Import\n  |\n Select the type of file you want to import into Domo, either CSV, JSON, or XML.\n  |\n|\n How Would You Like to Choose Your Filename?\n  |\n Select how you want Domo to identify your file.

If you choose\n **Add blank columns**\n , column names are automatically generated for the new columns. If you select\n **Stop at the first blank column**\n , the data import stops when an empty header is encountered.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Ensure that the file is present in the S3 bucket and that the correct file type is specified in the connector settings.\n* NULL columns\n *must*\n be removed before the connector can successfully retrieve data.\n* If you run into a \"Failed to Import Successfully\" error when trying to import a CSV file, you can often get around this by changing the option in the\n **Quote Character**\n menu to\n **Null Character**\n .\n\nFAQ\n-----\n\n\n####\n How frequently will my data update?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Can I use the same Amazon S3 account to create multiple DataSets?\n\nYes.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nYou may encounter a limit of 100 Amazon S3 buckets per account.\n\n###\n Why is the connector unable to pull the data?\n\nEnsure that the file is present in the S3 bucket and specify the correct file type in the connector settings. Also, remove null columns to allow the connector to retrieve the data.\n\n###\n What's the difference between the standard Amazon S3 connector and the advanced version?\n\nThe Amazon S3 connector and the Amazon S3 Advanced connector both use the same SDK. They differ in how they handle multiple files.\n\n\n If your Amazon S3 bucket contains multiple files that begin with the prefix string you provide in the Details section of the connector, the Amazon S3 connector will only import the latest modified file. The Amazon S3 Advanced connector will import all files with the provided prefix, assuming they all have the same schema.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436353\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003954\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAmazon S3 Advanced Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,242\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "amazon_s3_advanced_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "file_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaowGAC"}]}
