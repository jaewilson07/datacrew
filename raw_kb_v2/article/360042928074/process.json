A private key and matching Web Services (WS) Certificate is required to access ADP web services. The WS Certificate provides client information to ADP and the matching private key confirms the authenticity of the client.\n                       \n\n                        To generate the WS Certificate, a CSR needs to be generated by the client. During the CSR generation, the private key and matching public key are created. The CSR is submitted to the ADP Web Services Certificate Authority (currently run by Sectigo/Comodo) and they return the WS Certificate. Many software tools store the private key and the WS Certificate in one Personal Information Exchange Format (PFX), also known as a P12 file.\n                       \n\n                        Open Secure Sockets Layer (OpenSSL) is an open-source tool. Although ADP has tested the commands based on the OS, configuration settings, and other environmental factors, the commands and configuration may have to be adjusted. Clients will need to check and support the OpenSSL tool from their own IT department.\n                       \n\n                        Clients need to ensure that every time new private and public keys are created, they are managed properly. If they are generated more than once, each key pair must be stored (possibly in different directories) so there is no confusion. In addition, the returned Web Services Certificate (which also contains the public key) must be managed properly (stored in the directory that has the matching private key).

To do this, you will first need to request SFTP\u00a0Export from the ADP Reporting module, then set up an SFTP server for use in pulling reports. You will only need to go through this setup process once. There is a small one-time fee (around $200-$300). Once the server is set up, you can pull any number of reports with no additional fee.\n                       \n\n                        To pull reports, you build them in ADP, specify that they be sent via SFTP, and finally pull them into Domo using the CSV Advanced or SFTP connectors.\n                       \n\n                        Setting up SFTP\n                       \n\n\n                         To set up an SFTP server for use in pulling ADP reports,\n                        \n\n\n\n                         Work with your ADP representative to request SFTP Export from the ADP Reporting module.\n                         \n\n                         Your ADP representative will send you a Statement of Work (SOW) to fill out. The following PDF shows an example of this:\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Enter the details for\u00a0your SFTP\u00a0server.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Note:\n                              \n                              If you like,\u00a0Domo\u00a0can host your SFTP server.
