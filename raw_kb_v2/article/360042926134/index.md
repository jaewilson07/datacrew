You can export DataSets from Domo as Microsoft Excel or CSV files. You do this in the Details view for the DataSet in the Data Center.


**Note:**

Excel supports only up to one million rows when exporting. DataFusions cannot currently be exported.


---

*Important:**

By default, Domo disables any formulas in Excel files before they are exported (as these formulas could contain malicious code). If you are an Admin user or have a custom role with the "Manage All Company Settings" privilege enabled, you can re-enable Excel formulas when exporting by doing into

*Admin Settings > Security > Exporting data**

and unchecking the box reading "Disable Excel formulas." However, it is strongly recommended that you do not uncheck this box.
