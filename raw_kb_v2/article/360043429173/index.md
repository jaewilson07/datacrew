Intro
-------

High-low charts are used to represent rises


 and falls in stock values. These charts are similar to

candlestick charts

but are less complex, requiring only three columns (compared to five for a candlestick chart). For any given category, a vertical line is shown. The ends of the lines represent the high and low prices for the stock respectively.


 Powering high-low charts
--------------------------

High-low charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSetâ€”a category column or row containing the name of each stock or the dates if you are showing a time progression for a single stock; and two columns or rows with the values. One of the columns or rows contains low values for the stocks or dates and the other contains high values. For information about value, category, and series data, see
