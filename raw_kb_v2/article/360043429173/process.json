These charts are similar to\n\ncandlestick charts\n\nbut are less complex, requiring only three columns (compared to five for a candlestick chart). For any given category, a vertical line is shown. The ends of the lines represent the high and low prices for the stock respectively.\n\n\n Powering high-low charts\n--------------------------\n\nHigh-low charts require three columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a category column or row containing the name of each stock or the dates if you are showing a time progression for a single stock; and two columns or rows with the values. One of the columns or rows contains low values for the stocks or dates and the other contains high values. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your high-low chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer.\n\nThe following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a high-low chart:\n\nCustomizing high-low charts\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a high-low chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n .
