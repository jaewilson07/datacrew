*Important:**

*What is happening?**


 Quickbooks will be deprecating their OAuth 1.0 authentication on December 17. After this change, the Domo Quickbooks Online Connectors will no longer be able to authenticate to your Quickbooks Online Accounts. To prepare for this change, Domo is updating the Quickbook Connectors to support the newest version of OAuth that will be ready on December 9.


**How will this change affect me?**


 From December 9 onward, you will need to re-authenticate your Quickbooks Online accounts. Your DataSets will continue updating through December 17.


**What do I need to do to prepare?**


 After the updated Connector is released on December 9, you will not be able to see which Accounts were authenticated for which DataSet. Between today and December 9, please take the time to note which Credential Account your QuickBooks connectors are using.


**Before December 9**


 We recommend adding the account number to the name of each Quickbooks DataSet so you will be able to choose the correct account to authenticate to after the change on December 9. The account number can be found in the account name.

You can find all of your QuickBooks Accounts and the DataSets they power in the Accounts section in the Data Center.


**Between December 9 and December 17**


 When you open the DataSet settings on December 9, the credentials section will state that you do not have access to the account that powers the DataSet. You will need to go to each DataSet and click
 **Use a different account**
 and then re-authenticate your account by selecting the appropriate one from the drop down or selecting
 **Add account**
 to authenticate the one that needs to be used.


**After December 17th**


 Because QuickBooks is deprecating OAuth 1.0 on December 17, if you have not reauthenticated your account by December 17, there is a high probability that your DataSets will not continue updating. Please reauthenticate your account as soon as possible.


**FAQs**


**What if I don't know which account was authenticated to my DataSet?**


 You will need to figure out which account it is based on the data in the Connector.


**What if I haven't updated my account and my DataSet stops working before December 17?**


 Domo is using the cached AccessToken from the OAuth 1.0 which lasts 180 days. If your token expires between December 9 and December 17, your DataSets will stop running. In this case, you simply need to reauthenticate your account for the DataSets to update.


**How do I found the unique Account ID on QuickBooks Online?**


 To find your unique Account ID in QuickBooks Online, log into your account and select the settings gear. Navigate to
 **Account and Settings**
 and select the
 **Billing**
 area where you will see the Company ID
