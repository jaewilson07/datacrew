Whether it\u2019s a new budget proposal, a time off request, or something in between, Approvals is designed to allow you to incorporate all of your company\u2019s unique approval processes. When creating a template, you determine the information that must be provided before submitting a request, and the individuals or groups will review it.\n                       \n\n                        This topic discusses the specific steps for configuring a request template.

For example, if the first user in the chain was \"Brad Storch\" and the second user was \"Betty Symington,\" any requests made using this form would first be sent to Brad for his approval. Once Brad gave his approval, they would then be sent to Betty.
