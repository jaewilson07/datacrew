Use Domo's Microsoft Dynamics GP connector to retrieve various HR- and finance-related reports. To learn more about the Microsoft Dynamics GP API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc534132.aspx\n\n).\n\n\n**Note:**\n The user interface for building this connector is not yet available in our Connectors listing in the Data Center, meaning you will not be able to configure the connector on your own. However, we at Domo are more than happy to configure the connector for you so you can begin using it to pull your data into Domo. Please don't hesitate to reach out to your CSM or Domo Support. For contact information, see\n\n\n Getting Help\n\n\n .\n\n\n You connect to your Microsoft Dynamics GP account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Microsoft Dynamics GP connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Microsoft Dynamics GP account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The domain of your GP server\n* The username and password you use to log into GP\n* The host name/IP address of your GP sever\n* The port number of your GP server\n\nConnecting to Your Microsoft Dynamics GP Account\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Microsoft Dynamics GP Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Microsoft Dynamics GP account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domain\n  |\n Enter the domain of your GP server.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter the username you use to log into GP.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter the password you use to log into GP.\n  |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name or IP address of your GP server.\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number of your GP server.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Microsoft Dynamics GP credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Microsoft Dynamics GP DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains two menus/fields, one from which you select a report and the other
