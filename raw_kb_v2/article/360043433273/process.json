To create new Google Admin SDK Reports\u00a0DataSets, use this connector. All pre-existing Google Admin SDK Reports\u00a0DataSets will continue to run normally.\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nTo learn more about Google's Reports\u00a0API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/admin-.../v1/reference/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to Google Admin SDK Reports\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Google Admin SDK Reports connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a Google service account, you must have a Google service account JSON key and Service account username.\n\n###\n To generate a new service account and a key, do the following:\n\n1. Login into\n\nGoogle Cloud Console\n\n.\n\n\n 2. Click on\n **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n .\n\n3. Click Create\n **Credentials > Service account**\n .\n\n4. In the Create service account pane, enter a name and description for the service account, and click\n **Create and continue**\n .\n\n\n 5. In the\n\n*Grant this service account access to the project**\n section, select\n **Project > Owner**\n from the\n **Select a role**\n dropdown\n\n.\n\n6.\u00a0Click\n **Done**\n .\n\n\n 7. To create a new JSON key, in the\n **Service accounts**\n pane, click the three dots (expansion menu) and select\n **Manage keys**\n .\n\n8. In the\n **Keys**\n section, click\n **Add Key > Create new key**\n .\n\n9.\u00a0Select\n **JSON**\n as the key type and click\n **Create**\n .\n\n10.\u00a0Click\n **Create**\n .\n\n\n A private key will be saved to your computer.\n\n###\n\nTo Enable domain-wide delegation to the service key\n\n1. Locate the newly-created service account in the table. Under\n\n\n**Actions**\n , click\n\nthe three dots (expansion menu) and click\n **Manage Details**\n\n.\n\n\n 2. In the service account details, click\n\nand\n\n\n expand\n\n*Show domain-wide delegation**\n , then ensure the\n\n\n**Enable Google Workspace Domain-wide Delegation**\n\n\n checkbox is checked.\n\n3.\u00a0Click\n\n\n**Save**\n\n\n to update the service account, and return to the table of service accounts. A new column,\n\n\n**Domain-wide delegation**\n , can be seen.\n\n\n 4. Click\n\n\n**View Client ID**\n , to obtain and make a note of the client ID.\n\n###\n\nTo delegate domain-wide authority to your service account\n\nTo access user data on a Google Workspace domain, the service account that you created needs to be granted access by a super administrator for the domain. For more information about domain-wide delegation, see\n\nControl Google Workspace API access with domain-wide delegation\n\n.\n\n\n 1. From your Google Workspace domain\u2019s\n\nAdmin console\n\n, go to\n **Main menu > Security > API controls**\n .\n\n\n 2. In the\n **Domain wide delegation**\n pane, select\n **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**\n .\n\n\n 3. Click\n **Add new**\n .\n\n4. In the\n **Client ID**\n field, enter the client ID obtained from the service account creation steps above.\n\n5. In the\n **OAuth Scopes**\n field, enter a comma-delimited list of the scopes required for your application (for a list of possible scopes, see Authorize requests).\n\n\n For example, if you need domain-wide access to activity reports, enter:\n\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly\n\n\n https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.usage.readonly\n\n6. Click\n **Authorize**\n .\n\n\n Connecting to Your Google Admin SDK Reports Account\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Google Admin SDK Reports Service Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to a Google service account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Service Account Key JSON\n  |\n Copy and paste the JSON for your Google service account key. For information about creating a key, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Service Account User\n  |\n Enter your service account username. Example:\n\nes@xyz.com\n\n|\n\nOnce you have entered a valid key,\u00a0you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Google Admin SDK Reports\u00a0Service DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n ********************************Accounts********************************\n tab in the\u00a0Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with other menus for selecting your timeframe.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Google Admin SDK Reports report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Customer Usage\n  |\n Returns Google Apps service activities for the account's users.\n  |\n|\n Google Admin Activity\n  |\n Returns information about Admin Console activities for all of the account's administrators.\n  |\n|\n Google Drive Activity\n  |\n Returns information about how the account's users manage, modify, and share their Google Drive documents.\n  |\n|\n User Usage\n  |\n Returns Google Apps service activities for the account's users. (Data for some dates may be left blank until it becomes available.)\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Duration\n  |\n Select whether you want to pull data for a specific date or a date range.\n  |\n|\n Report Date\n  |\n Select whether the report data is for a specific date or for a relative number of days back from today.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Date\n  |\n Select the date for the report.\n  |\n|\n Days Back\n  |\n Enter the number of past days that should appear in the report.\n  |\n|\n Start Date\n  |\n Specify whether the\u00a0first date in your date range is a specific or relative date.\u00a0You select the last date in your range in\n **End Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n End Date\n  |\n Specify whether the second date in your date range is a specific or relative date. You select the first date in your range in\n **Start Date**\n .\n  |\n|\n Select Specific Start Date\n  |\n Select\u00a0the first date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Select Specific End Date\n  |\n Select the second date in your date range.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to Start From\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to End At**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n|\n Days Back to End At\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Days Back to Start From**\n to create a range of represented days.\n\n\n For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Days Back to Start From**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **Days Back to End At**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433273\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003580\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nGoogle Admin SDK Reports Service Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,665\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "google_admin_sdk_reports_service_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
