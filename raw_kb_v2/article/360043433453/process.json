(\n\nhttp://www.netsuite.com/portal/products/business-intelligence.shtml\n\n)\n\n\n The NetSuite Suite Analytics connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to NetSuite in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0NetSuite\u00a0SuiteAnalytics Connect\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Note:**\n This connector does not allow you to retrieve already created Saved Searches.\n\nIf you need to see the same results provided by these Save Search reports in Domo, you should create a new DataSet for each raw table involved in your end results and use Domo\u2019s ETL tools to combine these DataSets.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to pull data from tables you access through NetSuite using custom SQL queries.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Revenue\n* Cost\n* Projected Revenue\n* Customer/Lead Dates\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Finance (P&L data)\n* Sales managers\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 5-10 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 6\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to NetSuite and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Access to the SuiteAnalytics API, which you or your company must have purchased already (you can check to see if you have access by opening NetSuite Help Center in your NetSuite instance)\n* Your NetSuite username and password\n* The name of your NetSuite Service Host\n* The number of your NetSuite Service Port\n* Your NetSuite DataSet\n* Your NetSuite Role ID\n* Your NetSuite Account ID\n\nYou can find instructions for configuring\n **SuiteAnalytics Connect by opening Suite Analytics (Dashboards, Searches, & Reports) > SuiteAnalytics Connect > Introducing SuiteAnalytics\u00a0Connect > Getting Started**\n .\n\n\n Your Service Host, Service Port, DataSet, Role ID, and Account ID can be found in the \"SuiteAnalytics Connect: JDBC Driver Setup\" screen in NetSuite. Follow these instructions to access this screen:\n\n. Sign into Netsuite\u00a0at\n\nhttps://system.netsuite.com/pages/login.jsp\n\n.\n2. Click\n **Set Up\u00a0SuiteAnalytics Connect**\n , which is located under\n **Settings**\n in the bottom left corner of the screen.\n3. Click\n **JDBC**\n .\n4. Click\n **Default Configuration**\n .\n5. Copy all of the information into the required fields in Domo.\n\n*Follow the link below for instructions to setup:**\n\nSetup Guide\n\nConnecting to NetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connect\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0NetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connect\u00a0Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Service Host\n  |\n Enter the name of your NetSuite Service Host. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Service Port\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite Service Port number. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Service DataSet\n  |\n Enter the name of your NetSuite Service DataSet. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter\u00a0your NetSuite username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite password.\n  |\n|\n Role ID\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite Role ID number. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Account ID\n  |\n Enter your NetSuite Account ID number. For more information, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n\nOnce you have entered valid NetSuite credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0NetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connect\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n##\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create an SQL query to retrieve data from NetSuite database tables.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Query\n  |\n Enter the Structured Query Language (SQL) query to use in selecting the data you want. For example:\n\nselect \\* from Employees\n\nYou can see the available columns to use in building a query by selecting the desired table in the\n **Database Tables**\n menu. The columns for that table then appear in the\n **Table Columns**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Database Tables\n  |\n Select a database table to see the columns in that table in the\n **Table Columns**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Table Columns\n  |\n Browse to see the available columns in the table selected in the\n **Database Tables**\n menu. You can also select columns. Selected columns appear in the sample SQL query in the\n **Query Helper**\n field.\n  |\n|\n Query Helper\n  |\n Use this to help build SQL queries. When you select a column in the\n **Table Columns**\n field, a sample query referencing that column appears in this field. If you select additional columns, those columns are added to the query. You can edit the sample query as desired. Queries you build here can be copied and pasted into the\n **Query**\n field for use in retrieving data.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* You can find field IDs in NetSuite by clicking on a given label. For example, if you have a field whose label was changed to from \"Category\" to \"Class,\" you can navigate to a customer record and click on the \"Class\" label. You should see \u201cCategory\u201d as the field ID within a pop-up.\n* Even though Field IDs might display in the connector configuration, the API will not return data that a user does not have access to. Likewise, if a user has filtered settings, e.g. to only see Income Statement accounts and not Balance Sheet accounts, only permissioned data will return (so the user would not get balance sheet accounts in the DataSet). Data access is managed by a NetSuite Admin within a customer's organization.\n* You may not have access to all the available data in your NetSuite instance.\n\nIf you try to pull data\u00a0that you don\u2019t have access too, you will get an error or incomplete results. If this happens, you may have to talk to a NetSuite administrator to get access to the specific data.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043433453\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003564\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNetSuite SuiteAnalytics Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,062\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "netsuite_suiteanalytics_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
