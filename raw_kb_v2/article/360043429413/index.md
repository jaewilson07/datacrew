Intro

An Overlay Bar chart is similar to a standard

Stacked Bar chart

except that instead of being stacked, all series items begin from the baseline, so overlapping of series items occurs in a category when multiple series are present. In its initial non-rollover state, an Overlay chart is rather meaningless, as shown in the following example:

However, by mousing over a series item in the legend, you can see just that series in the chart, as shown in the following example:

In many applications this may be more useful than a Stacked Bar because you can more quickly compare series items in different categories. (In a Stacked Bar this is difficult because series in different categories do not usually begin from the same baseline.)


 Overlay Bar charts include both vertical and horizontal sub-types.


 Powering Overlay Bar charts
-----------------------------

An Overlay Bar chart requires three data columns or rows from your DataSet—one for categories, one for the series in each category, and one for values. For information about value, category, and series data, see

 In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your Overlay Bar chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see
