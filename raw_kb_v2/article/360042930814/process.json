Use Domo's CDC connector to retrieve data from more than 800 public datasets. To learn more about CDC\u00a0APIs, visit their page (\n\nhttps://open.cdc.gov/apis.html\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to CDC datasets in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the CDC connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nNone. All of the data available through this connector is public, so there is no need to enter credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to CDC datasets\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Details**\n pane\u00a0in the CDC\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu, along with a\n **Dataset ID**\n menu from which you can select your desired CDC dataset.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select a\u00a0report from the menu. Currently only a single report type is available.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n CDC Dataset\n  |\n Lets you select a CDC dataset in the\n **DataSet ID**\n menu.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Dataset ID\n  |\n Select the CDC dataset you want to pull into Domo. You can search for a specific dataset in the\n **Search**\n field or filter the list to show only datasets you have selected by clicking the eye icon.\n\n\n You can view available datasets and their descriptions at\n\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/browse\n\n.\n  |\n|\n Update Data\n  |\n\nGenerally CDC updates data once a month. Please select YES if you only want updated data on Scheduled runs and select NO if you want to return existing/updated data if CDC has not-updated/updated data on Scheduled runs\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n FAQs\n------\n\n\n#####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nNo credentials required.\n\n####\n How often should I update my CDC DataSets?\n\nDataSets cannot be updated more than once per day, and in most cases it is recommended that you\u00a0only update once per month.\n\n####\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042930814\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003378\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCDC Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,627\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "cdc_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
