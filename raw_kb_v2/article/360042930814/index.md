Intro
-------

As the USA's health protection agency, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) saves lives and protects people from health, safety, and security threats. Use Domo's CDC connector to retrieve data from more than 800 public datasets. To learn more about CDC APIs, visit their page (

https://open.cdc.gov/apis.html

).


 You connect to CDC datasets in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the CDC connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in
