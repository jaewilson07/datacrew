For information about the layout of the Appstore, see\n                        \n                         Appstore Layout\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Video - Appstore Overview\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        App types\n                       \n\n                        Apps in Domo come in\u00a0the following\u00a0types:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          QuickStart apps. These are packs of template KPI cards, each associated with a particular third-party connector, that you can power up with your own data in a matter of minutes. You power up QuickStart apps by connecting to a connector, usually by entering credentials and/or other information.\u00a0When you install a\u00a0QuickStart app, a page for the\u00a0QuickStart app is added to your Domo. This page contains all of the cards associated with this connector, powered by your own live data. For example, if you were to add the LinkedIn\u00a0QuickStart app to your Domo, a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0page would appear, with cards for \"Company Followers,\" \"Likes,\" \"Clicks vs. Impressions,\" and so on, all powered up with your own LinkedIn data. For more information about KPI cards, see\n                          \n                           Understanding KPI cards\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Card Builder apps. These are similar to QuickStart apps in that pages of template KPI cards you can power with your own data are produced. The major difference is that you power them not by connecting to a third-party connector but by\u00a0selecting a DataSet\u00a0with\u00a0matching\u00a0column names.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Custom\u00a0apps. These are cards that use multiple charts and images to present data measurements\u00a0using rich visualizations.\u00a0You can create\u00a0Custom apps yourself\u00a0using\u00a0app Design Studio\u00a0(an\u00a0Adobe Illustrator-based plugin) or app Dev Studio (a tool best suited for developers with web-based experience). For information about creating and publishing Domo\u00a0apps, see\n                          \n                           https://developers.domo.com\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Connectors in Domo\n                       \n\n                        Connectors are an extremely efficient method for accessing your data. They allow you to use your existing data service to power your apps within Domo. By simply inputting your data\u00a0provider credentials (where necessary), the connector will map the data from the provider to power your app, and there\u2019s no need to involve any people to get your apps up and running.\n                       \n\n                        Publishers\n                       \n\n                        In an effort to meet the needs of as many different customers as possible, Domo has given the opportunity to third-party developers (called publishers) to create apps and publish them to the Appstore to be installed by anybody. This partnership allows publishers to specialize in the content they produce while simultaneously increasing value in the Appstore experience. All publisher apps are subject to the same approval process and criteria as any Domo-made app, so you can rest assured that all content in the Appstore meets Domo\u2019s standard.\n                       \n\n                        For more information about publishing apps, see\n                        \n                         https://developer.domo.com\n                        \n                        .", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360042933174", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
