Use Domo's Eloqua Writeback connector to push your Domo data into an\u00a0Eloqua custom object. To learn more about the Eloqua API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://community.oracle.com/community/topliners/code-it\n\n).\n\n\n You export data to Eloqua\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Eloqua Writeback\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you must have the following:\n\n Your Eloqua username\n* Your Eloqua password\n* Your Domo client ID\n* Your Domo client secret\n\nTo create a Domo client ID and client secret, do the following:\n\n. Navigate to\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com\n\nand log in.\n2. Click\n ****New Client****\n (found under \"My Account\" in the top right corner).\n3. Create a new client with Application Scopes of\n ****Data****\n and\n ****User****\n .\n\n\n When you click\n ****Create****\n , you will be redirected to the client ID and client secret.\n4. Copy the client ID and client secret, as you will need them soon.\n\nConfiguring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Eloqua Writeback Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to Eloqua\u00a0as well as your Domo developer account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Domo Client ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo client ID. For steps on obtaining your client ID and client secret, see \"Prerequisites,\" above.\n  |\n|\n Domo Client Secret\n  |\n Enter your Domo client secret.

For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains various fields and menus for setting up your Domo-Eloqua connection.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n DataSet ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to an Eloqua custom object. You can find the ID by opening the details view for the DataSet in the Data Center and looking at the portion of the URL following\n\ndatasources/\n\n.\u00a0For example, in the URL\n\n\n https://mycompany.domo.com/datasourc...tails/overview\n\n\n , the DataSet ID is\n\n845305d8-da3d-4107-a9d6-13ef3f86d4a4\n\n.\n\n\n |\n|\n Eloqua Object\n  |\n Select the Eloqua\u00a0object you want to write your Domo data to.\n  |\n|\n Identifier Fieldname - Eloqua Field\n  |\n Select the field (column) in the selected Eloqua\u00a0custom object you want to write data to. This data will be copied from\u00a0the column\u00a0you select for\n **Identifier Fieldname - DataSet Field**\n . For example, if you select\n **Numbers**\n for\n **DataSet Field**\n and\n **Number of Tickets**\n for\n **Eloqua Field**\n , all data in the\n **Numbers**\n column will be copied into the\n **Number of Tickets**\n column.\n  |\n|\n Identifier Fieldname - DataSet Field\n  |\n Select the field (column) in the selected Domo DataSet\u00a0you want to copy into your Eloqua custom object. This data will be copied into the column\u00a0you select for\n **Identifier Fieldname - Eloqua Field**\n . For example, if you select\n **Numbers**\n for\n **DataSet Field**\n and\n **Number of Tickets**\n for\n **Eloqua Field**\n , all data in the\n **Numbers**\n column will be copied into the\n **Number of Tickets**\n column.\n  |\n|\n Optional Fields - Eloqua\u00a0Fields\n  |\n Select an optional field (column) in the selected Eloqua\u00a0custom object you want to write data to. This data will be copied from\u00a0the column\u00a0you select for\n **Optional Fields**\n**- DataSet Fields**\n . For example, if you select\n **Numbers**\n for\n **DataSet Fields**\n and\n **Number of Tickets**\n for\n **Eloqua Fields**\n , all data in the\n **Numbers**\n column will be copied into the\n **Number of Tickets**\n column.\n\n\n You can add rows for more optional fields by clicking the plus button on the right, or remove a row by clicking the minus button.\n  |\n|\n Optional Fields - DataSet Fields\n  |\n Select an optional\u00a0field (column) in the selected Domo DataSet\u00a0you want to copy into your Eloqua custom object. This data will be copied into the column\u00a0you select for\n **Optional Fields**\n**- Eloqua Fields**\n . For example, if you select\n **Numbers**\n for\n **DataSet Fields**\n and\n **Number of Tickets**\n for\n **Eloqua Fields**\n , all data in the\n **Numbers**\n column will be copied into the\n **Number of Tickets**\n column.\n\n\n You can add rows for more optional fields by clicking the plus button on the right, or remove a row by clicking the minus button.\n  |\n\n\n**Note:**\n The Eloqua Writeback Connector looks for a\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n column. If this column is present in the input DataSet, the Connector will keep track of the highest\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n in the source DataSet to keep track of the data already written to Eloqua. For the next run the Connector will only write rows with a\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n higher than the one recorded on previous runs. This is to avoid writing duplicate data to Salesforce. If the\n *\\_BATCH\\_ID\\_*\n column is not present in the source DataSet, all the data will be written to Salesforce every time the Connector runs.\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932234\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004049\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nEloqua Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 2,378\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:19 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "eloqua_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
