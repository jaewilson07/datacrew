Intro
-------

DomoStats gives you the freedom to explore how your team is using Domo. Because DomoStats is powered by a live Domo DataSet with no configuration, you can easily build Cards, alerts, and workflows around the metrics you want to see as well as use the pre-built dashboard.


 This DomoStats - People App gives Admins a list of all their users so they can see who is in Domo and their level of activity all in one place. Watch adoption levels and take action quickly to help people get onboard by knowing login trends and seeing who still needs to log in. Keep your instance secure and make sure everyone is working at the best level for them.
