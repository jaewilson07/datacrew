You can use Domo's SugarCRM\u00a0connector to retrieve data about employees, notifications, records by module, and more. To learn more about the SugarCRM API, visit their website. (\n\nhttp://support.sugarcrm.com/Document...ces/index.html\n\n).\n\n\n The SugarCRM connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your SugarCRM account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SugarCRM connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Lead management\n* Pipeline management\n* Sales management\n* Customer relationship management\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Leads\n* MQL\n* SAO\n* Closed Deals\n* Won Deals\n* Average Deal Size\n* Open Opportunities\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Marketing, sales\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 10-15 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 5\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your company SugarCRM instance and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The host URL for your company's SugarCRM instance\n* Your SugarCRM username and password\n* Your SugarCRM client ID (which you can find in the SugarCRM Admin page under\n **OAuth Keys**\n ;\n\nsugar\n\nis the default client ID for API access)\n\nConnecting to Your SugarCRM Account\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SugarCRM Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Credentials Pane\n------------------\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your SugarCRM account.
