Intro

Data that is collected from websites or mobile apps, or is uploaded using web service APIs or data sources, is processed and stored in Adobe's Data Warehouse. This raw clickstream data forms the dataset used by Adobe Analytics. To learn more about the Adobe Analytics API, visit their page (

).


 You import Adobe Analytics datafeed data by connecting to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket containing the data. You do this in the Data Center in Domo. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Adobe Analytics Datafeed connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to an AWS S3 bucket and import Adobe Analytics datafeed data, you must have the following:

 Your AWS access key. You can find this in the
 ****Security Credentials****
 section of the AWS Console. Alternatively, if you are using IAM, you can find it under
 ****Users****
 .
* Your AWS secret key, which was provided when you created your access key. You can generate a new secret key in the AWS Console.
* The name of the AWS S3 Bucket you want to retrieve files from.
