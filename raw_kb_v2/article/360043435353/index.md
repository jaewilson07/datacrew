Intro
-------


 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a unit of the United States Department of Labor. It is the principal fact-finding agency for the U.S. government  in the broad field of labor economics and statistics and serves as a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System. The Domo Bureau of Labor Statistics connector allows you to extract headlines from BLS publications in RSS Feed (XML) format.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

You create a Bureau of Labor Statistics DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Bureau of Labor Statistics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector
