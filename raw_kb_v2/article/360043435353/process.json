It is the principal fact-finding agency for the U.S. government\u00a0 in the broad field of\u00a0labor economics and statistics\u00a0and serves as a principal agency of the\u00a0U.S. Federal Statistical System. The Domo\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0connector allows you to extract\u00a0headlines\u00a0from BLS publications in RSS Feed (XML) format.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou create a\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Bureau of Labor Statistics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n To learn about BLS\u00a0Unemployment public-facing datasets, see\n\nPublic Datasets Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to...\n * View consumer price index (CPI) trends\n* View college enrollment trends\n* View employment trends\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Unemployment numbers/percentages\n* Consumer price index trends\n* Employee wage trends\n* Employee cost indices\n* Real average hourly earnings\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n HR directors\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n A few minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 1\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nIt is helpful to review the BLS report types and definitions to identify where appropriate data can be obtained.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this connector unless you plan to run the \"Local Area Unemployment Statistics\" report, in which case a registration key is required. Otherwise no credentials are necessary.\n\n\n To obtain a registration key, go to the BLS Public Data API 2.0\n\nregistration page\n\n, and enter your email address and organization name. Complete the CAPTCHA. You will receive an email from\n\n\n labstat@bls.gov\n\n\n with your registration key.\n\nCreating a\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0DataSet\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section describes how to create a\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0DataSet in the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0Connector page.
