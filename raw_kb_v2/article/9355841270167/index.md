Intro
-------

Domo's Story Presentation Mode allows you to make better presentations featuring your data. While in the mode, you can still view important details about the data, like who owns it and when it was last updated. If your audience wants a closer look at a dense table or visualization, you don't have to leave your presentation—Filters and Drill Paths function normally in the mode.


 This article describes the Story Presentation Mode interface.
