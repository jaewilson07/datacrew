This service supports a subset of the reports available in the Bing Ads web application.\n\n\n The reports that you can request are grouped into the following categories.\n\n\n* **Delivery**\n\n\n Show the overall effectiveness and cost of ads and keywords for a specified time period. You can include details in the reports\u2014such as clicks, conversions, and spending\u2014that you can use to identify the ads and keywords that are performing well and those that you may need to adjust.\n* **Budget**\n\n\n Shows your monthly budget, how much you have spent to date, and whether you are on target to spend your monthly budget.\n* **Targeting**\n\n\n Determine whether your ads are reaching their intended audiences.\n* **Campaign Analytics**\n\n\n Used to measure the effectiveness of the account\u2019s ad campaigns, primarily in terms of return on investment. In addition, you can use the reports to learn which pages on your website are most commonly abandoned by visitors and then use this information to change the design of your website to improve conversions.\n\n\n To learn more about the Bing Ads API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bing-ads-getting-started.aspx\n\n).\n\nThe Bing Ads connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your Bing Ads account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Bing Ads\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Ad conversion\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n Ad click-thru rates\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Web marketing roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n ~1 hour\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nUse the backfill to pull in historic data.\u00a0The first time the report\u00a0runs, historic data will be retrieved. Subsequent runs will only pull in the date ranges specified.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0Bing Ads\u00a0account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* Your Bing Ads developer token. For information about obtaining a developer token, see\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bing-ads-getting-started.aspx\n\n.\n* Secret ID and Value associated with your Microsoft Azure app\n* You will also need to set the following redirect URI:\n\n*https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/bingads/exchange**\n\n\n###\n Obtaining your Developer Token\n\nTo find your developer token:\n\n. Go to\n\nhttps://developers.ads.microsoft.com/Account\n2. Make sure it's a Super Admin account and that the token is a Universal token, and verify that it's the same account that is creating the Azure portal app.\n\n##\n Configuring your Azure App to obtain your Secret ID and Value\n\n\n1. Login into\n\nAzure Portal\n\n.\n2. Select\n ****Azure Active Directory > App Registrations > New Registration****\n .\n\n\n 3. Fill out the registration form as follows:\n\n Name:\u00a0enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example 'DomoConnector'.\n* Supported account types: Select\n **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory \u2013 Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts**\n .\n* Redirect URI: Add and save the following URI:\n\n*https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/bingads/exchange**\n .\n\nThe authentication response is sent to this URI after successfully authenticating the user. Providing the URI\u00a0at this stage\u00a0is optional and it can be changed later, but a value is required for most of the\u00a0authentication scenarios.\n\n4. Click\n **Register**\n to create the application.\u00a0An overview of your registered App will appear.\n\n5. The\n ****Application ID****\n that appears here\u00a0is the\n ****Client ID****\n you will enter in the\n ****Credentials****\n pane in Domo.\n\n6.\u00a0Select\n **Authentication**\n under Manage. Under\n **Implicit Grant**\n , check the box to enable both Access Tokens and ID Tokens. Select\n **Save**\n at the top of the page to save the changes.\n\n7. Select\n **API Permissions**\n under Manage. You will need the\n **User.Rea**\n**d**\n and\n **User.ReadBasic.All**\n permissions.\n\n\n 8. To add permissions, select\n **Add a Permission**\n . Select Microsoft Graph API, and then Delegated Permissions. Type or Navigate to\n **User.ReadBasic.All**\n , check the box, and click\n **Add Permissions**\n .\n\n9.\u00a0Select\n **Certificates & Secrets**\n under Manage. Certificates can be used as secrets to prove the application\u2019s identity when requesting a token. Also, can be referred to as public keys.\n\n\n 10. Select the +\n **New client secret**\n button.\n\n11. Enter a value in Description, select a suitable option for Expires and click\n **Add**\n .\n\n*Important:**\n Ensure to c\n\nopy the client secret Value (not the Secret ID) before leaving the page. It's not displayed again after you leave this page.\n\n\n This will be the Client Secret\u00a0within Domo.\n\n\n 12.\u00a0Now, enter the\n **Developer Token**\n ,\n **Client ID**\n , and\n **Client Secret**\n in Domo under the Credentials section for the Bing Ads connector, and click Connect. There will be a popup to Log in to Microsoft. Login using your Super Admin account and follow the prompts to complete the connection.\n\n##\n\n\n Debugging the\n\n\n Azure portal app and BingAds account\n\nWhile\u00a0creating your account, if you get an\u00a0error \"There was a problem creating your account. Please try again\",\u00a0you can check the following configuration\u00a0to debug your Azure portal app and BingAds account.\n\n. In your Azure portal app, check the following:\n\n\n* Under Authentication -> Supported account types, select \"Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory \u2013 Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts\"\n\n Verify that the redirect URI is\n **https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/bingads/exchange**\n* Under Authentication -> Implicit grant, check Access tokens and ID tokens\n\n Under API permissions, select User.Read and User.ReadBasic.All\n\n\n 2. In your Developer Token which you can find at\n\nhttps://developers.ads.microsoft.com/Account\n\n, make sure it's a Super Admin account and that the token is a Universal token, and verify that it's the same account that is creating the Azure portal app.\n\n\n 3.\n\nYou need to create a new client secret in the app that you previously created, copy the Value of that secret, and use that to create the Bing Ads account in Domo. If that doesn't work, create a new app and use those credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Bing Ads\u00a0Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Bing Ads\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains\u00a0a single field where you enter your Bing Ads developer token.\u00a0\u00a0You are then taken to the Microsoft OAuth page where you are required to enter your Microsoft username and password. Once you have entered valid\u00a0Microsoft credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Bing Ads\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n **Data Center**\n . For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n\nSelect the\u00a0Bing Ads\u00a0report you want to run.
