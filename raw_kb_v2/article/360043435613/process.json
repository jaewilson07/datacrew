This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Booker connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Booker account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The client ID for your Booker application\n* The client secret for your Booker application\n* The subscription key for your Booker application, found under the\n **Profile**\n section of your account.\u00a0Your subscription must have \"Merchant\" level access.\n* The personal access token for your Booker application, found under the\n **Profile**\n section of your account.\n\nConnecting to Your Booker Account\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Booker Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Booker account.
