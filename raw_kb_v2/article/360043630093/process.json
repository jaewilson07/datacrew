These Connectors must also have SSL enabled on their database server in order to authenticate.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           The federated agent (on-premise deployment) does not require incoming IP allowlisting.

Doing so will simply lock everyone out of the instance who is not coming from the IP addresses listed below.
