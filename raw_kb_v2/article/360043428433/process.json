With Domo Stories, however, only Page owners and \"Admin\" users can make changes to Card order and size. This provides a single source of truth by ensuring that all users see the same thing in a Page.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Cards in\u00a0standard Pages\u00a0may appear differently across different devices or platforms (i.e. different desktop window sizes, email reports, print, etc.).\u00a0Cards in a Domo Stories Page, however,\u00a0appear the same no matter what device or platform you are using.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          In standard Pages, all Cards are the same size and dimensions by default. If you want to change the size or dimensions of a Card, you must do it manually. In a Domo Stories Page, you can choose from hundreds of\u00a0different templates, each of which contains slots appropriate for different Card sizes and dimensions. You can also resize templates from the Page level, which changes the dimensions of the Cards in the templates.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Domo Stories cannot be collapsed as Collections in standard Pages can.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          You can export Domo Stories Pages to PDFs. You cannot do this with standard Pages. For more information, see\n                          \n                           Exporting Domo Stories Pages to PDF\n                          \n                          .\n                         \n\n\n\n                        You can use Card-to-Card Filters in Domo Stories and in standard Pages. These Filters allow you to filter all Cards on a Page by setting a Filter on a single Card. Interaction Filters are automatically enabled in Domo Stories but must be turned on manually in standard Pages. For more information, see\n                        \n                         Using Filter Cards to Filter Card Content\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Cards in a Domo Stories Page have all of the same options as Cards in a standard Page EXCEPT the sizing options. If you want to resize a Card in a Domo Stories Page, you drop it into a different-sized slot or resize the template from the Page view while editing the Page. There are no height restrictions for Cards in Domo Stories; they can be as tall as you want.\n                       \n\n                        In Domo Stories, you can change the background color of Pages as well as Cards. This is not possible in standard Pages.\n                       \n\n                        You cannot have Domo Stories and Card Collections in the same Page.\u00a0If you have any Collections in your Page when you turn on Domo Stories, all of the Collections are converted into Domo Stories Pages. Likewise, if you convert a Domo Stories Page back into a standard Page, all of the Domo Stories are turned back into Collections. If you convert a Page with Collections into a Domo Stories Page and there are any Cards not in a Collection, these Cards are added to an \"Appendix\" section at the bottom of the Page.\n                       \n\n                        Converting a standard Page to a Domo Stories\u00a0Page\n                       \n\n                        To convert a standard Page (with or without Collections) to a Domo Stories Page, you must be the Page owner or have an \"Admin\" default security role.
