Intro
-------

Domo Stories allow you to tell targeted stories by creating custom Pages that translate smoothly across devices and retain the same Card orientation and size. Because each layout has been optimized individually for web, mobile, tablet, print, and Scheduled Reports, Domo Stories tell a consistent story no matter where the story ends up being consumed. With hundreds of layout templates built individually for dozens of use cases, you can create Domo Stories that bridge the gap between understanding the data and taking action.


######
 Domo Stories differ from

standard Pages

in the following ways:


* In standard Pages, individual users can move and resize Cards. With Domo Stories, however, only Page owners and "Admin" users can make changes to Card order and size. This provides a single source of truth by ensuring that all users see the same thing in a Page.
* Cards in standard Pages may appear differently across different devices or platforms (i.e. different desktop window sizes, email reports, print, etc.). Cards in a Domo Stories Page, however, appear the same no matter what device or platform you are using.
* In standard Pages, all Cards are the same size and dimensions by default. If you want to change the size or dimensions of a Card, you must do it manually. In a Domo Stories Page, you can choose from hundreds of different templates, each of which contains slots appropriate for different Card sizes and dimensions. You can also resize templates from the Page level, which changes the dimensions of the Cards in the templates.
* Domo Stories cannot be collapsed as Collections in standard Pages can.
* You can export Domo Stories Pages to PDFs. You cannot do this with standard Pages. For more information, see

Exporting Domo Stories Pages to PDF

.

You can use Card-to-Card Filters in Domo Stories and in standard Pages. These Filters allow you to filter all Cards on a Page by setting a Filter on a single Card. Interaction Filters are automatically enabled in Domo Stories but must be turned on manually in standard Pages. For more information, see

Using Filter Cards to Filter Card Content

.


 Cards in a Domo Stories Page have all of the same options as Cards in a standard Page EXCEPT the sizing options. If you want to resize a Card in a Domo Stories Page, you drop it into a different-sized slot or resize the template from the Page view while editing the Page. There are no height restrictions for Cards in Domo Stories; they can be as tall as you want.


 In Domo Stories, you can change the background color of Pages as well as Cards. This is not possible in standard Pages.


 You cannot have Domo Stories and Card Collections in the same Page. If you have any Collections in your Page when you turn on Domo Stories, all of the Collections are converted into Domo Stories Pages. Likewise, if you convert a Domo Stories Page back into a standard Page, all of the Domo Stories are turned back into Collections. If you convert a Page with Collections into a Domo Stories Page and there are any Cards not in a Collection, these Cards are added to an "Appendix" section at the bottom of the Page.


 Converting a standard Page to a Domo Stories Page
---------------------------------------------------

To convert a standard Page (with or without Collections) to a Domo Stories Page, you must be the Page owner or have an "Admin" default security role. For more information about security roles, see

Default Security Role Reference

.


**To convert a standard Page to a Domo Stories Page,**

. Select
 **Design Dashboard**
 in the

menu in the top right corner of the Page.
2. Click
 **Design Dashboard**
 .


 If the Page contains Collections, all of the Collections become Domo Stories Pages, and any extra Cards not in Collections are added into the "Appendix" section at the bottom of the Page. If the Page does not contain Collections, all of the Cards are added to a single default Domo Stories Page with an "Example Header" heading.
3. (Conditional) If you are already satisfied with the Domo Stories layout on the Page, click
 **Save**
 then
 **Close**
 . Otherwise, first edit the Domo Stories Page layout following the instructions under Editing Pages, below.

*Note:**
 When you convert a standard Page to a

Domo Stories

Page, the
 **Edit Dashboard**
 and
 **Convert to Standard Page**
 options are grayed out while the Pages and Cards load.


 Converting a Domo Stories Page back to a standard Page
--------------------------------------------------------

To convert a Domo Stories Page (with or without Collections) back to a standard Page, you must be the Page owner or have an "Admin" default security role. For more information about security roles, see

Default Security Role Reference

.


**To convert a Domo Stories Page back to a standard Page,**

The Domo Stories edit mode contains various options for editing your Domo Stories. In this mode you can do all of the following:

 Add new Card layouts based on a variety of Domo Stories templates.
* Drag and drop Visualization Cards into the slots in the layouts you have added.
* Resize templates and the Cards within them by dragging their borders
* Swap Cards in a layout by dragging one Card on top of another.

###
 Adding a Domo Stories Page

You can add a new Domo Stories Page to your Domo instance by selecting
 **New Story**
 in the
 **Add to Domo**
 menu.


**To add a Domo Stories Page to your instance,**

. Click

in the top right corner of the screen.
2. Select
 **New Story**
 .
3. Enter a title for the new Stories Page.

A new Domo Stories template Page is added, and the edit mode is opened by default. You can now begin adding and customizing Domo Stories layouts as described in the following sections.

##
 Adding a Domo Stories layout

You can add a Domo Stories layout by clicking the

icon that appears on the right side of the Page view when the Domo Stories edit mode is open, then dragging it to the desired location on the Page. You can then select the desired Domo Stories layout template. The template you select will then be added to this location in the Page.


**To add a Domo Stories layout,**

. On the Page where you want to add a Domo Stories layout, select
 **Edit Dashboard**
 in the

menu in the top right corner of the Page.
2. Click and drag the

icon from the toolbar on the right side of the Page to the location on the Page where you want the new layout.


 When you drag the layout icon over a border, it highlights to indicate you can put the layout there. In the example below, the user is dragging the icon over the line directly beneath the "Group 1" layout.

Once you drop the

icon onto a border, the
 **Choose a layout**
 dialog opens.
3. Use the filter options to locate the desired template.

* The
	 **Categories**
	 menu lets you filter by template category. Categories are as follows:


	|
	 Template
	  |
	 Description
	  |
	| --- | --- |
	|
	 All
	  |
	 The top templates are shown for all categories. You can show all of the templates for a category by clicking
	 **View All**
	 for that category.
	  |
	|
	 With banner
	  |
	 All of these templates include a long, narrow slot at the top where you can insert a Card to use as a banner.

 |
	|
	 Hero
	  |
	 All of these templates include at least one very large slot for Cards that should immediately draw viewers' attention ("hero Cards").

 |
	|
	 Quick summary
	  |
	 All of these templates consist of small slots for Cards that are intended to be glanced at.

 |
	|
	 General purpose
	  |
	 All of these templates consist of a mix of small and large Cards.

 |
	* The
	 **Number of Cards**
	 menu lets you filter by the number of Card slots in the template.
4. Once you locate the desired template, click on it.


 The template for the layout is now added to the designated location in the Page.

*Tip:**
 You can return to the
 **Choose a layout**
 dialog to change your template by mousing over the layout and clicking the pencil icon

that appears on the left. Note that when switching a template, the new template does
 *not*
 need to contain the same amount of slots as the current template. If the new template has fewer slots available than the current template, the extra Cards are moved to the "Appendix" section at the bottom of the Page. If the new template has more slots available than the current template, the new slots appear as empty in the template.
5. Do any of the following to add Cards to the layout:

* Drag Cards from elsewhere in the Page into the appropriate slots in the template.


	 You can drag Cards from other Domo Stories in the Page, from the "Appendix" area, etc. When you drag a Card (represented by a

 icon) over a border line in a layout, it highlights to indicate the Card will end up there when you drop it.

 Note that when you move a Card into a different-sized slot, the Card automatically resizes itself to fit the slot.


	 If you drag a Card onto another Card, the two Cards switch places. So if you dragged "Finance: AR Aging" from "Group 2" onto ""Finance: COGS" in "Group 1," "Finance: AR Aging" would take over the spot in Group 1, and "Finance: COGS" would appear in the spot formerly containing the other Card in Group 2.
	* Add an existing Visualization Card from your Domo instance into an empty slot by doing the following:

	1. In the slot where you want to add the Card, click
		 **Add Content**
		 .
		2. Select
		 **Add existing Card**
		 .
		3. Locate the Card you want to add by entering its name in the
		 **Search Cards**
		 field and clicking on it.
	* Add an existing Visualization Card from your Domo instance to a layout
	 *without*
	 an empty slot by doing the following:

	1. Click and drag the

	 icon from the toolbar on the right side of the Page to the spot where you want the Card to appear.


		 When you drag the Card icon over a Page, borders between layout slots highlight to indicate the spots where you can insert the Card. In the example below, the user is dragging the icon over the line between the "Finance: COGS" and "Outstanding Debt" Cards.

	 When you drop the icon onto a line, a slot appears for the Card with an
		 **Add Content**
		 button.
		2. Click
		 **Add Content**
		 .
		3. Select
		 **Add existing Card**
		 .
		4. Locate the Card you want to add by entering its name in the
		 **Search Cards**
		 field and clicking on it.
	* Add an image Card (essentially a

 Document Card

 containing an image) inline to a layout by doing the following:

	1. Click and drag the

	 icon from the toolbar on the right side of the Page to the spot where you want the image Card to appear.


		 When you drag the image icon over a Page, borders between layout slots highlight to indicate the spots where you can insert the Card.
		2. Click
		 **Choose Image**
		 .
		3. Select the image you want to upload from your computer or network.
	* Add a notebook Card inline to a layout by doing the following:

 Customizing individual Cards
------------------------------

In Domo Stories, there are a number of ways to customize Cards that are not available in standard Pages. These include changing Card background colors, showing or hiding Card elements such as titles and summary numbers, and configuring the actions that take place when users click on Cards.

##
 Changing the background color for a Card

You can select a different background color for a Card in a Domo Story by selecting
 **Edit Content > Change background**
 . This change takes precedence over any background colors you have set for an entire Story (discussed in the previous section). So, for example, let's assume you have a Domo Story called "Street Metrics." Within that Story is a Card called "Net Income." You set the background color for that Card to red to draw attention to it. If you then change the overall color scheme of the "Street Metrics" Story to blue, all of the Cards in the Story take on blue backgrounds
 *except*
 for the Card you already set to red.


**To change the background color for a Card,**

. On the Page containing the Card you want to change the background color for, select
 **Edit Dashboard**
 in the

menu in the top right corner of the Page.

5. (Optional) To remove a fill from a Card, click
 **No Fill**
 in the color palette.

*Tip:**
 When setting the background color of a Card, be sure it doesn't interfere with the colors already set in your chart. Remember that your primary goal is to communicate information to your viewers, not impress them with your flashy color choices!

##
 Showing or hiding Card elements

For any given Card, you can hide Card elements such as titles, timeframes (i.e. date grains, such as "By day"), Summary Numbers, and even charts themselves. For example, you could hide the chart for a Card entirely and show just the Summary Number for the card. You do this by selecting
 **Edit Content > Display settings**
 then checking or unchecking the elements you want to show or hide.

*Video - Domo Stories: Summary Metric View**
