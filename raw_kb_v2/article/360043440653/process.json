They can also view cards that have been shared with them. They cannot create cards or drill into new cards. On mobile they can see pages but not go into interactive mode on charts. On the web version, they cannot see pages at all.\n                       \n\n                        You can grant access to your Domo instance to an unlimited number of social users. Social users can be invited into your instance by other users (including other Social users).\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see our\n                        \n                         Security Role Reference\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Report Scheduler\n                       \n\n                        Domo\u2019s new Report Scheduler allows you to get those critical reports into\u00a0the right\u00a0hands faster and easier than ever.\u00a0 With just a few clicks of the mouse, you can enable the delivery of any card or page by email at just the right time. You can use this feature to send reports to any\n                        \n                         Domo user in your instance or any non-Domo user with an authorized domain\n                        \n                        .\u00a0Report recipients will see the card details for every card included in the report. Cards in the email are ordered the same way as in Domo, including collections. Recipients with a Domo account can quickly link back to the live card or page in Domo from their desktop or mobile device.\n                       \n\n\n                         You can also manage your\u00a0reports. In the Report Scheduler page you can see all reports you've created\n                        \n                        and those you receive.\u00a0You can subscribe and unsubscribe to any of your reports, as well as edit each report\u2019s schedule, view the report histories, send reports immediately, delete reports, and enable or disable individual\u00a0reports. You can also make Analyzer changes to a report for a page or card that affect only the report; visitors to the actual page or card will not see the filters you have applied.\n                       \n\n\n                         If you have an \"Admin\" security profile, you can manage all reports for your company. Y\n                        \n                        ou can edit individual report schedules as well as delete or enable and disable any report.\u00a0You can also see a full history, including the ability to isolate successful or unsuccessful messages. Finally, if for any reason you need to suspend all Report Scheduler activity, you can disable this feature entirely.\u00a0Disabling Report Scheduler does not delete or destroy any of the reports that have been scheduled; it simply suspends the sending of reports until the feature is re-enabled.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Scheduling Reports\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n                         CSV Upload\n                        \n\n\n                        You can use Domo's CSV Upload connector to build DataSets based on CSV data.\n                        \n                         Just like our Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets connectors, the CSV connector allows you to\u00a0 add KPI cards powered by CSV data directly to a page without having to open the Data Center. If you want, you can also add CSV DataSets\u00a0from the Data Center and then build cards afterward, just as you can with all of Domo's other third-party connectors.\n                        \n\n\n                        CSV files can be uploaded to Domo using any of the following methods:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Sending them to a Domo-hosted SFTP server, either by uploading through your favorite SFTP client, using the command line, or sending directly from a service such as Adobe Analytics.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Uploading directly from your machine or network.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Copying and pasting the CSV content right into Domo.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        For more information about these and other connectors, see\n                        \n                         CSV Upload Connector\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Ability to save page-level filters\n                       \n\n                        You can now save page-level filters to that page so they are already set anytime you visit that page. These filters are applied only to your specific Domo instance, so other users navigating to the page will not see the filters applied.\u00a0This ability is especially useful for Participant-level users, as they can manipulate filters set by other users and save the updated filters\u00a0to their own Domo\u00a0instances.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        For more information, see\n                        \n                         Applying Page-Level Filters\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Workbench Updates\n                       \n\n                        Workbench 4.5.1 has been released, and includes the following fixes and improvements:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          Ability to create SFTP connections with an SSL certificate.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          OLAP now locates all providers on your machine.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Improved handling of custom values.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Ability to search for Workbench 2 DataSet Jobs and migrate them into Workbench 4.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Ability to bulk-export DataSet Jobs.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Ability to grab a dynamic file name.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Ability to specify comment characters for a CSV file.

There are a few points to keep in mind with this functionality, which are as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          The plugin downloads Sumo\n                          \n                           table data\n                          \n                          into PowerPoint, not actual Sumo\n                          \n                           cards\n                          \n                          .

The size of these cards depends on the number of cards per slide you select in\n                          \n                           Templates\n                          \n                          .
