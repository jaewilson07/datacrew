You can then access, control, sort, analyze, and take action on the data instantly-from your office, the road or home. The connector enables all those reports to be easily imported into Domo.\n\nFor more information about the\u00a0BambooHR API, visit\u00a0their website. (\n\n\n http://www.bamboohr.com/api/documentation/\n\n\n )\n\nThe BambooHR connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your\u00a0BambooHR account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0BambooHR\u00a0connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for returning head count, payroll, and recurring reporting.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Employee demographics\n* Salary information\n* Custom reports\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * VP\n* HR director\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 10 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 3\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nMake sure to include all applicable custom fields in your report.\n\nPrerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your\u00a0BambooHR account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* Your company domain name or the URL of your company BambooHR instance. This is the same\u00a0URL you use to log in to the BambooHR web interface. For example:\n\nhttps://companydomainname.bamboohr.com`\n* Your BambooHR\u00a0API key. To generate an API key for a given user, log in to BambooHR and click\u00a0your name in the upper right hand corner of any page to access the user context menu. Then click\n **API Keys**\n to open a page in which you can generate an API key. For more information about API keys, see\n\n\n http://www.bamboohr.com/api/documentation/login.php\n\n\n .\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0BambooHR Account\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0BambooHR\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n**Credentials Pane**\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0BambooHR\u00a0account.

You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu in which you select a report type.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nReport\n\n|\n\nSelect a BambooHR report.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Company Report\n  |\n Returns data of all the reports of the particular company.\n  |\n|\n Complete Employee Data\n  |\n Returns complete data for all the current employees.\n  |\n|\n Employee Bulk Data\n  |\n Returns data of all the employees in a single report.\n  |\n|\n\nEmployee Data\n\n|\n\nReturns data about employees, such as name, address, email, birthday, gender, ethnicity, department, supervisor, etc.\n\n|\n|\n\nUser Data\n\n|\n\nReturns data about users of this account, including first and last name, email, status, etc.\n\n|\n\n\n |\n|\n\nCustom Fields\n\n|\n\nSelect all fields you want to appear in your report.\n\n|\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\na DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Verify the Company Domain Name and API are correct.\n* Validate the results by running the report in BambooHR.\n\nFAQ\n-----\n\n\n#####\n What version of the BambooHR API does this connector use?\n\nThis connector uses version 1 of the BambooHR API\n\nhttps://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{\n\nsubdomain}/v1/).\n\n####\n Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint URL\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Company Report\n  |\n /reports/{reportid}\n  |\n|\n Employee Data\n  |\n /employee/{employeeid}/?fields=(customfields)\n  |\n|\n Employee Bulk Data\n  |\n /reports/customs\n  |\n|\n User Data\n  |\n /meta/users\n  |\n\n\n#####\n What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need your company domain name and API key.\n\n####\n Where can I find my API Key?\n\nTo generate an API key To generate an API key, log into BambooHR and click your name in the upper right corner of any page to access the user context menu.
