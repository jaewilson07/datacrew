Intro

Hive provides an efficient, reliable tool for streamlining, planning, and managing several workflows simultaneously.

It allows users to create and organize tasks for themselves and their teammates, with task deadlines, attachments and labels. The Domo Hive Project Manager connector can return various reports such as Teams, Actions, Labels, Role Tags and much more.
