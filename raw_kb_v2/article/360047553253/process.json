If he then applied an ascending sort to the \"SKU\" column, the groupings of rows for each SKU would be ordered numerically. If he finally applied a third sort, descending, to the \"Zip Code\" column, those values would be sorted in descending order for each transaction-SKU grouping.\n                           \n\n                            The following screenshot shows an example of this behavior:\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Info button\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Shows the description for this column, if you have added one in the\n                            \n                             Schema\n                            \n                            subtab.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                           Data type icon\n                          \n\n                           Indicates the data type for this column.\n                           \n                           indicates a numeric (value) column,\n                           \n                           indicates a date or date-time column, and\n                           \n                           indicates a string column.
