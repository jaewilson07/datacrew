Intro
-------

A category scatter chart is similar to a

scatter plot chart

in that items are plotted using X-Y coordinates—for every x and y value pair, a bubble is plotted on the chart. However, whereas in a scatter plot chart points are plotted at the intersection of two values, a category scatter chart includes both a value scale and a category scale, and bubbles are plotted at the intersection of each category-value pairing. Categories are represented down the y-axis and values are measured along the x-axis, as in horizontal bar charts.


 Powering category scatter charts
----------------------------------

A category scatter chart requires two columns of data in your DataSet—one for categories and one for values. For information about value and category data, see

 In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your category scatter chart. For more information, see

 The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a category scatter chart:
