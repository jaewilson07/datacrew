However, whereas in a scatter plot chart points are plotted at the intersection of two values, a category scatter chart includes both a value scale and a category scale, and bubbles are plotted at the intersection of each category-value pairing. Categories are represented down the y-axis and values are measured along the x-axis, as in horizontal bar charts.\n\n\n Powering category scatter charts\n----------------------------------\n\nA category scatter chart requires two columns of data in your DataSet\u2014one for categories and one for values. For information about value and\u00a0category data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your category scatter chart. For more information, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nVisualization Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a category scatter chart:\n\nCustomizing category scatter charts\n-------------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a category scatter chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n .
