The Domo connector expects JSON format, so all endpoints must include a parameter of\n                        \n                         format=JSON\n                        \n                        . The Domo Bundle uses the SuiteScript API (which is JavaScript-based) to extract data from Netsuite.\n                       \n\n                        The connector has two components:\n
