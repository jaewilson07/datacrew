Intro
-------

NetSuite allows for data to be extracted via REST in JSON formats by accessing the endpoints as detailed below. The Domo connector expects JSON format, so all endpoints must include a parameter of

format=JSON

. The Domo Bundle uses the SuiteScript API (which is JavaScript-based) to extract data from Netsuite.


 The connector has two components:

 The Domo Bundle running inside your NetSuite instance
* The connector code running in Domo

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your NetSuite account and create a DataSet using this connector, you must have the following:

 Your NetSuite username and password
* Your

NetSuite Role ID (only required if no default role is specified or if you do not want to use the default role)
* A NetSuite account ID
* A NetSuite script bundle and deploy bundle ID
* A NetSuite report ID

Each of these items is discussed in more detail in the next sections.


 Configuration Instructions
----------------------------


1. Download the following SuiteScript files.

* EC\_Libs-4.0.0.js
	* EC\_RestletDataExtractor.js
2. In NetSuite, go to
 **Documents > Files > File Cabinet**
 .
3. Create a new folder inside the SuiteScripts folder named "Domo."
4. Upload the two files (

EC\_Libs-4.0.0.js

and

EC\_RestletDataExtractor.js

).
5. Go to
 **Customization > Scripting > Scripts.**
6. Under
 **File**
 , search for and then select the script file (

EC\_RestletDataExtractor.js

).


 A form now opens in which you can create the restlet.
7. Fill out the form with the recommendations below (case-sensitive):


 Name =

Domo Data Connection

ID =

\_domo\_data\_extractor

Script File =

EC\_RestletDataExtractor.js

GET Function =

EC.get

Library Script File =

EC\_Libs-4.0.0.js
8. Click
 **Save and Deploy**
 .


 You will now be taken to the Script Deployment center.
9. For the
 **Deployment ID**
 , enter

\_domo\_deployment

.
10. For the
 **Status**
 , select
 **Released**
 and leave the
 **Log Level**
 at
 **Debug**
 .
11. For the
 **Audience**

13. Save and deploy the script.


 After the script is deployed it will present you with the Script Deployment status screen.
14. Copy the
 **External URL**
 link for use in the next step.


 Once you complete the installation in the NetSuite instance, you will need to make the connection in your Domo instance.

Connecting to Your NetSuite Data in Domo
------------------------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the


**Credentials**


 and


**Details**


 panes in the NetSuiteApp Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,

Useful Links
--------------

The following NetSuite document describes the SuiteScript API, which is what we use for the NetSuite connector. Specifically the chapter on RESTLets (chapter 22) pertains to our connector architecture.

Limitations
-------------

Saved searches will never connect to NetSuite financial statements because of balancing entries that NetSuite doesn't expose in the saved search results.

Troubleshooting
-----------------


* If you get an "Unexpected Error" message after configuring the connection, check your column names for invalid characters such as apostrophes, quotation marks, backslashes, etc.
* Verify that the External Script URL, Script ID, and Deploy ID in NetSuite match what is in the connector.
* Verify that the saved search ID in NetSuite matches what is in Domo and that it is the internal ID.
* Verify that the saved search runs without issue in NetSuite.
