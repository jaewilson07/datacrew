Use Domo's SharePoint Online Writeback connector to\u00a0push data from a Domo DataSet to Sharepoint. To learn more about the SharePoint API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/lib.../jj860569.aspx\n\n).\n\n\n You configure your Domo-Sharepoint connection\u00a0in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Sharepoint Online\u00a0Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo configure this connector, you must have the following:\n\n An installed Microsoft Azure app\n* The Client ID and Client Secret associated with your Domo Developer account\n* The Secret ID and Value associated with your Microsoft Azure app\n\n\n####\n To obtain your Domo Client ID and Client Secret:\n\n\n1. Log into the\n\nDomo developer account\n\n.\n2. In the top right corner under\n **My Account**\n click\n **New Client**\n .\n3. Enter the application name and description.\n4. Provide the application scope by selecting the checkboxes for\n **Data**\n and\n **User**\n .\n5. Click\n **Create**\n . Once you have created a client, you can manage the client by clicking on\n\n\n**Manage Client**\n .\n6. Your\n **Value**\n\nwill appear in the\n\n*Manage Client**\n\nsection.\n\n\n####\n To obtain your SharePoint Secret ID:\n\n\n1. Go to\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n2. Select\n **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**\n .\n3. Find and click on your web app.\n4. The \"application ID\" is your\n **Secret\u00a0ID**\n .\n\n\n####\n To obtain your SharePoint Value:\n\n. Go to\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n2. Select\n\n\n**Azure Active Directory > App registrations**\n .\n3. Find and click on your web app.\n4. Open\n\n\n**Certificates and secrets**\n .\n5. Click\n\n\n**+New secret**\n .\n6. Provide the value description and the expiry period for your secret. Click\n\n\n**Add**\n .\n7. Your new value will appear. Copy it and paste in your Domo connector SharePoint client secret field.\n\n##\n Creating an Azure App\u00a0for Enterprise OAuth\n\nTo create a Microsoft Azure app, do the following:\n\n\n 1. Log into\n\n\n https://portal.azure.com\n\n\n .\n\n\n 2. Click on\n **App registrations**\n .\n\n3. Click\n **New registration**\n .\n\n\n 4. Enter the application name and select the supported account type as below. Enter the Redirect URI for Web as -\n **https://oauth.domo.com/api/data/v1/oauth/providers/sharepointonlinewriteback/exchange**\n .\n\n5. Click\n **Register**\n .\n\n\n 6.\n\nThe\n\n*Application ID**\n\nthat appears here is the\n **SharePoint**\n\n*Client ID**\n\nyou will enter in the\n\n*Credentials**\n\npane in Domo. O\n\nnce the application is registered, assign the required API permissions for your application.\n\n\n 7.\u00a0 Now, click\n **API Permissions**\n .\n\n8. Click\n\n*+Add Permissions**\n\nbutton and select the permissions as required.\n\n9. After adding the permissions, the configured permissions will be listed as below.\n\n10. Select\n **Certificates & Secrets**\n under Manage. Certificates can be used as secrets to prove the application\u2019s identity when requesting a token. Also, can be referred to as public keys.\n\n\n 11. Select the +\n **New client secret**\n button.\n\n\n 12. Enter a value in Description, select a suitable option for Expires and click\n **Add**\n .\n\n\n**Important:**\n Ensure to copy the client secret Value (not the Secret ID) before leaving the page. It's not displayed again after you leave this page.\n\n\n Configuring the Connection\n----------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the SharePoint Online Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Sharepoint Online account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Sharepoint Secret ID\n  |\n Enter your Sharepoint secret ID.\n  |\n|\n Sharepoint Value\n  |\n Enter your Sharepoint value.\n  |\n|\n Domo Secret ID\n  |\n Enter your Domo secret ID.\n  |\n|\n Domo Value\n  |\n Enter your Domo value.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Sharepoint Online\u00a0Writeback DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains options for configuring your connection.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Input DataSet\u00a0ID\n  |\n Enter the DataSet\u00a0ID (GUID) for the DataSet you want to copy to Sharepoint Online.

Note that the key value is generated only once. You won't be able to retrieve the key value again.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nAs often as needed.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits that I need to be aware of?\n\nNo\n\n###\n Can I use the same Sharepoint Online Writeback account to create multiple datasets?\n\nYes\n\n###\n Why can't I connect to my SharePoint database? Do I need to whitelist any IP addresses?\n\nBefore you can connect to a SharePoint database in Domo, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the port you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see Whitelisting IP Addresses.\n\n###\n How do I find the Input Dataset ID?\n\nYour Domo input dataset id is in the URL of the dataset you are exporting data from. For example:\n\nhttps://customer.domo.com/datasources/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee/details/settings\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042932494\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004018\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nSharepoint Online Writeback Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,953\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:18 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "sharepoint_online_writeback_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "writeback_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapVGAS"}]}
