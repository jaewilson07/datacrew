Intro
-------

HubSpot is an inbound marketing platform designed to help your business attract customers. The Hubspot Upsert connector gets real-time alerts for your ticket data. Use Domo's HubSpot Upsert connector to retrieve the data for your tickets based on various properties. This connector supports a merge mode to update your dataset, thus avoids duplicate entries. To learn more about the HubSpot API, visit their page (

http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview

).


 The HubSpot Upsert connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 ****Cloud App****
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your HubSpot account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the HubSpot Upsert connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and

 panes in the HubSpot Upsert Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo HubSpot Upsert connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing HubSpot accounts in Domo) to open the HubSpot OAuth screen where you can enter your HubSpot credentials. Once you have entered valid HubSpot credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new HubSpot DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into HubSpot when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of HubSpot.
