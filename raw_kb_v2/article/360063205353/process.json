With the Domo Adobe Analytics API v2 connector with JWT authentication and Partition support, you can retrieve data about customers, various metrics, dimensions, and segments to see the big web engagement picture. Adobe Analytics delivers virtually anything you need to understand and measure your visitors\u2019 online behavior. With Domo, you can easily access Adobe's web analytics metrics and combine them with data from CRM, POS, finance, and any other system to make faster, better-informed decisions. With your data in Domo, you can snapshot how your web presence develops over time and get instant notifications when Adobe Analytics metrics hit thresholds that you determine. This connector supports partitioning and uses custom reports.\n\nTo learn more about the Adobe Analytics API, visit their website (\n\nhttps://marketing.adobe.com/developer/en\\_US/get-started/introduction/c-introduction\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to the Adobe Analytics API in the Data Center.\n\nThis topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Adobe Analytics API v2 Connector with JWT authentication and Partition support user interface.\n\n\n General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\n\n To connect to Adobe Analytics v2 and create a dataset, you must create an Adobe Analytics Service Account (JWT) project in the Adobe Developer Console and provide the following:\n\n\n* Client ID (API Key)\n* Client Secret\n* Technical Account ID\n* Organization ID\n* Private Key for your Adobe integration in PEM format\n\n\n**Note:**\n To generate the key, you must be a user with the Admin role in Adobe Analytics in order for the connector to work correctly.\n\n##\n\nCreating\u00a0a new project in Adobe Developer Console with JWT authentication\n\nTo create a new project in Adobe Developer Console, do the following:\n\n. Log into\n\nhttps://console.adobe.io/projects\n\n.\n2. Click\n **Create new project**\n button.\n\n\n 3. Click on\n **Add API**\n to start using\u00a0the Adobe services.\n\n4. The APIs available to you will be listed in the\n **Add an API**\n window. Select\n **Adobe Analytics**\n .\n\n5. Now, you need to select the authentication type. Select\n\n\n**Service Account (JWT)**\n here.\n\n6.\u00a0Select\n\n\n**Generate a key pair**\n\n\n and click\n\n\n**Generate Keypair**\n .\n\n7. A new key pair will be generated and downloaded to your system.\u00a0The public key will be uploaded to your JWT project. The private key will be\u00a0downloaded.\n\n8. Unzip the file \"config.zip\", open the directory \"config\", and open the file \"private.key\" with a basic text editor. This is the\n\n\n**Private Key**\n\n\n you will paste into Domo, in Credentials section.\n\n\n 9. Now, click\n\n\n**Next**\n .\n\n\n 10. Select the desired product profiles, then click\n\n\n**Save Configured API**\n .\n\n\n 11.\u00a0This takes you to the\n\n\n**Project APIs and Services**\n\n\n page. If you scroll down, you will see the\n\n\n**Client ID, Client Secret, Technical Account ID**\n\n\n and\n\n\n**Organization ID**\n that you will use to create the Adobe Analytics JWT account in Domo.\n\n12. (Optional) Rename the project to something you will recognize later. Navigate to the\n\n\n**Project Overview**\n\n\n page, then click\n\n\n**Edit Project**\n .\n\n\n Connecting to Your Adobe Analytics API v2 Account\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n\n*Credentials**\n\nand\n\n*Details**\n\npanes in the Adobe Analytics API v2 Connector with JWT authentication and Partition support page.\n\n\n The components of the other panes in this page,\n\n*Scheduling**\n\nand\n\n*Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n\n, are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\n\n Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n\n .\n\n\n###\n Credentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to the Adobe Analytics API v2.

This API provides the same functionality as the V1.4 of the API.\n\n###\n\nI successfully created an Adobe Analytics JWT account, but later got an alert: \"Account Adobe Analytics JWT Account has been Deactivated\". Why is this happening and what can I do about it?\n\nWhen you create your JWT token, you set the expiration period for it. Please check if the expiration period for your JWT is over.\u00a0Adobe Analytics suggests to have\u00a0a very short lived token (a few minutes) - such that it expires soon after it has been exchanged for an IMS access token. Hence, every time a new access token is required, one such\u00a0JWT is signed and exchanged. This is a secure approach. For more details, see\n\nClaims for Service Account JWT\n\n.\n\n\n####\n\nWhat's the difference between the Adobe Analytics v2 OAuth and Adobe Analytics v2 JWT connectors?\n\nThe Adobe Analytics v2 connector uses the OAuth authentication whereas the Adobe Analytics API v2 Connector with JWT authentication uses the JWT authentication. Adobe recommends that you use JWT authentication, as you will have to refresh the OAuth account every two weeks because the OAuth refresh token expires.\n\n###\n\nWhat version of the Adobe Analytics API does this connector use?\n\nThis connector uses the version 2 of the Adobe Analytics API (\n\nhttps://analytics.adobe.io/api/2\n\n).\n\n###\n\nWhich endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n\n\n|\n Report Name\n  |\n Endpoint URL(s)\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Calculated Metrics\n  |\n /calculatedmetrics\n  |\n|\n Collections\n  |\n /collections/suites\n  |\n|\n Dimensions\n  |\n /dimensions\n  |\n|\n Metrics\n  |\n /metrics\n  |\n|\n Report\n  |\n /reports\n  |\n|\n Segments\n  |\n /segments\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n /users\n  |\n\n\n####\n\nWhat kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n\nYou need the Client ID (API Key), Client Secret, Technical Account ID, Organization ID, and Private Key associated with your Adobe Analytics v2 JWT project.\n\n###\n\nAre there any API limits that I need to know?\n\nIn order to run a report with multiple dimensions in Adobe Analytics API 2.0, Domo gets the data in multiple small API calls. If getting data for many dimensions or over a long time period, the dataset might timeout after 24 hours. To prevent this, pull a smaller amount of data or fewer dimensions.\n\n###\n\nWhich Adobe Analytics connector should I use?\n\nAdobe recommends that you use Adobe Analytics v2 with JWT authentication. Adobe OAuth refresh tokens expire after two weeks, which requires you to refresh your account.\n\nTroubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n* Make sure your authentication remains valid.\n* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.\n* Review the Connector history for error messages.\n* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360063205353\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003241\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAdobe Analytics API v2 Connector with JWT authentication and Partition Support\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 5,017\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:11 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:39 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "adobe_analytics_api_v2_connector_with_jwt_authentication_and_partition_support", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
