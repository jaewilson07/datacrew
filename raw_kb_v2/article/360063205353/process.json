Please check if the expiration period for your JWT is over.\u00a0Adobe Analytics suggests to have\u00a0a very short lived token (a few minutes) - such that it expires soon after it has been exchanged for an IMS access token. Hence, every time a new access token is required, one such\u00a0JWT is signed and exchanged. This is a secure approach.

Adobe recommends that you use JWT authentication, as you will have to refresh the OAuth account every two weeks because the OAuth refresh token expires.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          What version of the Adobe Analytics API does this connector use?\n                         \n\n\n                         This connector uses the version 2 of the Adobe Analytics API (\n                         \n                          https://analytics.adobe.io/api/2\n                         \n                         ).\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Which endpoint(s) does each report call in this connector?\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Report Name\n                           \n\n                            Endpoint URL(s)\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Calculated Metrics\n                           \n\n                            /calculatedmetrics\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Collections\n                           \n\n                            /collections/suites\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Dimensions\n                           \n\n                            /dimensions\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Metrics\n                           \n\n                            /metrics\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Report\n                           \n\n                            /reports\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Segments\n                           \n\n                            /segments\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Users\n                           \n\n                            /users\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          What kind of credentials do I need to power up this connector?\n                         \n\n\n                         You need the Client ID (API Key), Client Secret, Technical Account ID, Organization ID, and Private Key associated with your Adobe Analytics v2 JWT project.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Are there any API limits that I need to know?\n                         \n\n\n                         In order to run a report with multiple dimensions in Adobe Analytics API 2.0, Domo gets the data in multiple small API calls.

To prevent this, pull a smaller amount of data or fewer dimensions.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                          Which Adobe Analytics connector should I use?\n                         \n\n\n                         Adobe recommends that you use Adobe Analytics v2 with JWT authentication.

If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360063205353", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
