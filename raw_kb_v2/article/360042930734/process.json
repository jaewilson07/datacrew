To learn more about\u00a0the Qualtrics API, visit their\u00a0website (\n\nhttps://api.qualtrics.com\n\n).\n\n\n The Qualtrics connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Qualtrics account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Qualtrics connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for the following use cases:\n * Viewing trends in surveys created\n* Viewing the current number of active surveys\n* Looking for trends in survey responses\n* Looking for correlations in survey response percentage and the number of questions per survey\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Number of responses per survey\n* Number of active surveys\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Marketing roles\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n ~15 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Qualtrics account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n Your Qualtrics API token.\u00a0You can\u00a0find this logging into your Qualtrics account and\u00a0navigating to\n **Account Settings\u00a0> Qualtrics IDs**\n .\u00a0If you do not have an API token, click\n **Generate API Token**\n .\n* Your Qualtrics API hostname.\n* The username for your Qualtrics account (only required for 360 surveys and datasets created prior to April 2017)\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Qualtrics Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Qualtrics\u00a0Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your\u00a0Qualtrics account and choosing a survey type. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n Field\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n API Token\n  |\n Enter your Qualtrics API token.
