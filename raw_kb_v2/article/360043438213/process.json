This message contains identifying information about your Domo instance so that your IdP knows which system you are trying to log into. Depending on your settings in Domo, it may also contain a digital certificate to further authenticate that the login request originated from Domo.\n                       \n\n                        The SAML response is a message sent from your IdP to Domo during login. This message contains identifying information about the person logging in so that Domo knows which user you are. It also contains a digital certificate to confirm that the login response comes from your IdP.\n                       \n\n                        A typical SAML login works like this:\n                       \n\n\n                         Navigate to the URL of your Domo instance.\n                        \n\n\n                          Select\n                          \n                           Sign In\n                          \n                          .\n                          \n                          Domo redirects you\u00a0to the IdP\u00a0with a\u00a0SAML request packet.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          The IdP authenticates whether you have permission to log in to Domo from its system.\n                          \n                          If you have permission, the IdP redirects you back to Domo with a SAML response packet.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Domo verifies that the SAML response packet contains the correct authorization information from the IdP and allows you to log in.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n                              If\n                              \n                               Skip to Identity Provider\n                              \n                              is selected in your Domo SSO\u00a0settings, you do not have to select\n                              \n                               Sign In\n                              \n                              during login;\u00a0you are\u00a0automatically\u00a0redirected to the IdP's login\u00a0page.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              If you have recently logged in to the IdP for Domo or another service, the IdP may skip the username and password prompt and immediately return you to Domo.\n                             \n\n\n\n                              If both of the above occur, the entire login process may be invisible to you, except for a possible 1-5 second delay while the redirects and other steps\u00a0take place in the background.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Basic Troubleshooting\n                       \n\n                        Before proceeding to advanced troubleshooting in the next sections, review these common causes of failed SAML logins:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          If you do not see the\n                          \n                           Sign In\n                          \n                          button when logging in:\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Make sure you enter the instance URL correctly.\u00a0Entering an incorrect URL still takes you to a normal login page, even if there is no real Domo instance at that address.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Check if\n                            \n                             Mixed-mode Sign-in\n                            \n                            is enabled in your Domo SSO settings; if\u00a0it is, the product is working as intended. This option displays the\u00a0regular login page for normal instance logins but allows IdP systems to initiate\u00a0SSO logins, which is most commonly used for SSO-enabled embedding of cards in external systems where SSO is not desired for regular logins.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          If you receive an error when logging in, and the error displays on a Domo-branded\u00a0webpage, the issue may be:\n                         \n\n\n\n                            The IdP redirected you to the wrong Domo login URL.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The digital certificate sent by the IdP in the SAML response does not match the certificate that was uploaded to Domo for validating the origin of the SAML response.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Your email attribute is not correctly defined in the SAML response.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Your email attribute IS correctly defined in the SAML\u00a0Response, but the email is not assigned to any existing users, and\n                            \n                             Only invited people can access Domo\n                            \n                            is selected in your Domo SSO settings. When this option is selected, users must be manually created and cannot be auto-generated when logging in via SSO.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n                         If you receive an error when logging in, and the error does NOT display\u00a0on a Domo-branded\u00a0webpage, the issue may be:\n                         \n\n\n                            The SAML Endpoint URL or Entity ID is incorrect in your Domo SSO\u00a0settings.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            The IdP is expecting a signed SAML request, but\n                            \n                             Sign Authentication Requests\n                            \n                            is not enabled in your Domo SSO settings. Alternatively, the digital certificate loaded into the IdP does not match the certificate provided by Domo near where this setting is enabled.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            You do not have IdP permissions to use Domo.
