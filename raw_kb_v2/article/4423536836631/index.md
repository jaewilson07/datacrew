Intro
-------

Tableau is a data visualization tool that is widely used for business intelligence but not limited to it. It helps make Big Data small, and small data insightful and actionable. With Tableau you can connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click. The main use of tableau software is to help people see and understand their data.


 Combine your Tableau data with Domo and plan for future business demands. With the Domo Tableau Connector, you can get constant access to your data, and gain views and insights on your data. To learn more about the Tableau API, visit their page (

https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest\_api/en-us/REST/rest\_api.htm

).


 The Tableau Connector is a "Cloud App" Connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the Connector page for this and other Cloud App Connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Tableau account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Tableau Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Tableau account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 Your Tableau domain
* Username and password associated with your Tableau account
* Your site attribute ID

 Troubleshooting
-----------------


* Make sure your authentication remains valid.
* Review the configuration to make sure that all required items have been selected.
* Review the Connector history for error messages.
* In rare cases, you may be requesting too much information and reaching API limitations or timeouts. If this is the case, you can review the history of the Connector run to see the error message and duration. If this is the case, you can reduce the number of accounts that are being pulled, choose a smaller number of metrics for the report that you are pulling, or reduce the timeframe that you are trying to pull.
