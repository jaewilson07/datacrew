Writeback Connectors give you the power\u00a0to\u00a0share data between your business systems that\u00a0currently\u00a0don't\u00a0talk to each other. And now, if\u00a0Domo\u2019s library does not\u00a0yet include what you need,\u00a0you have\u00a0the expanded ability to build your own. For more information, visit\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/docs/writeback-connectors/build\n\n.\n\n##\n Data Science Home Page\n\nThe Data Science Home Page shows all of the powerful data science tools in one place, gives you quick access to the data science tools, outlines the products and services, and\u00a0where tools fit into the data science maturity journey. For more information, see\n\nData Science Home Page\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Python and R SDK enhancements\n\nThe R and Python SDK's have been updated to use the same function naming for both languages and to have the same functions available in each. For more information, visit\n\nhttps://developer.domo.com/docs/domo-sdks/sdks\n\n.\n\n##\n Scheduled Reports security options\n\nWith the new Scheduled Reports security options, Admins now have the ability to enable the\n **Limit to Domo\u00a0users**\n option.\u00a0When this setting is configured, Domo blocks scheduled reports to any external email address, only email addresses tied to an existing account will receive reports.\u00a0For more information, see\n\nScheduling Reports\n\n.\n\n##\n Auto-Width Dashboards\n\nWith the Auto-Width Dashboard setting, Dashboard content will expand to fill all the available window space. This will allow for more rows/columns to be visible from the Dashboard view. This is enabled on a per-Dashboard basis to allow you to customize your Stories.\u00a0For more information, see\n\nCreating Domo Stories\n\n.\n\n##\n New custom import chart types\n\nWith the new custom import chart types, you can now create custom charts from more than just\u00a0SVG files.\n\n\n The following formats are now supported:\n\n **KML (keyhole markup language) -**\n is a file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser such as Google Earth.\n* **GeoJSON -**\n is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes.\n* **TopoJSON -**\n is an extension of GeoJSON that encodes geospatial topology and that typically provides smaller file sizes.\n* **Shape -**\n is an\n\nESRI standard file format. Includes geospatial vector data (import Google Earth and export as KML.)\n\nFor more information, see\n\nCustom Charts\n\n.\n\n##\n Divergent colors\n\nDivergent colors make it easy to quickly create and display range distributions by combining multiple color themes.\u00a0Divergent colors allow you to pick any starting color and any ending color. In addition, you can pick the number of ranges to use. Divergent colors also provide you control of your midpoint. You can select the midpoint value and color or to not include the midpoint.\u00a0For example, you can use diverging colors to make it easier to see hot to cold trends in your data by using a red theme combined with a green theme to show a more complete range of values. Divergent colors add\u00a0this flexibility to Map and Heat Map\u00a0Cards. For more information, see\n\nHeat Map\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Week view in Calendar Cards\n\nThe week view in Calendar Cards add a new option\u00a0to show as a \u201cWeek\u201d view. This allows navigation by week and lets you customize the\u00a0start of the week shown. For more information, see\n\nCalendar\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Dependency Gantt chart\n\nThe Dependency Gantt chart\u00a0handles changes in dates for you and gives many new display options to communicate project timelines, such as:\n\n Calculate end dates from dependency and duration data.\n* Show dependency data relationships.\n* Display milestones.\n* Show projects and sub-projects in a hierarchy.\n* Allow resource tracking and representation in the chart.\n* Smart date calculations \u2013 automatically account for weekends or display them.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nDependency Gantt Chart\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Progress bar\u00a0color ranges\n\nThe Progress bar chart now has up to four color ranges that can be used to augment your chart. You can specify a\u00a0minimum and maximum value for each range and select the corresponding color you would like to display. For more information, see\n\nProgress Bar Gauge\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Create a \"top n\" Trellis chart\n\nThe Trellis Chart Property now\u00a0allows you to\u00a0see just the top/bottom \u201cn\u201d\u00a0in a category.\u00a0For example,\u00a0Top 5 Customers by Region. The Trellis Chart Property is found in most chart types. For more information, see\n\nProperties Available for Most Charts\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Analyzer UI improvements\n\nWe\u2019ve made it easier to work in Analyzer with the following improvements:\n\n Limit Rows in Analyzer is now grouped with Filter and Sort.\n* Filter and Sort are\u00a0combined into one section.\n* Summary number dropdown and format changes now auto-saves, so you no longer need to click Apply.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAnalyzer Layout\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Saved Search\n\nWith the Saved Search feature, you can save and easily come back to your common searches\u2014no matter how complex they are. For more information, see\n\nSearching in Domo\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Regional formatting for multinational corporations\n\nRegional formatting allows Admins to set date and number formats globally on the Domo platform based on your region. Users can also now select their region as well as their language.\u00a0Formatting conventions based on your region will now be used to display numerical, financial, and date/time values based on your region. For more information, see\n\nSetting Your Time Zone and Regional Formatting\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Support for screen readers in Stories\n\nScreen readers in Stories give\u00a0expanded access for screen readers and keyboards to better enable\u00a0customers\u00a0to expose Domo content to users with accessibility requirements. Domo\u2019s improved accessibility functionality allows customers to make their Cards screen reader-friendly, as well as find Stories, traverse layouts, and read Card details.\u00a0For more information, see\n\nSupport for Screen Readers in Stories\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Buzz Status\n\nThe Buzz Status feature allows you to set your status on web or mobile to\n **Available**\n ,\n **Busy**\n ,\n **Away**\n , or\n **Out of the office**\n . When someone sends you a 1:1 message or @mentions you in a conversation and your status is set to something other than Available, they will see a warning message that states you are unavailable. You can also add custom messaging to your status message when you are unavailable. An icon on your avatar indicates your current status.
