Writeback Connectors give you the power\u00a0to\u00a0share data between your business systems that\u00a0currently\u00a0don't\u00a0talk to each other. And now, if\u00a0Domo\u2019s library does not\u00a0yet include what you need,\u00a0you have\u00a0the expanded ability to build your own.

In addition, you can pick the number of ranges to use. Divergent colors also provide you control of your midpoint. You can select the midpoint value and color or to not include the midpoint.\u00a0For example, you can use diverging colors to make it easier to see hot to cold trends in your data by using a red theme combined with a green theme to show a more complete range of values.
