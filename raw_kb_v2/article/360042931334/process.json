You can use\u00a0Domo's Strava\u00a0connector to\u00a0compile reports\u00a0about\u00a0physical activities for yourself and your friends.\u00a0To learn more about the\u00a0Strava API, visit their\u00a0page (\n\nhttps://strava.github.io/api/\n\n).\n\n\n The Strava connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0Strava account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0Strava connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n Use this connector to measure your activity and progress over time, as well as compare to your Strava friends.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Miles travelled\n* Elevation gained\n* Activity time\n* Max speed\n* Average speed\n* Segment performance\n* Activity log\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n |\n Appropriate for any role\n  |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 (can probably be implemented in a few minutes)\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nUse to create pages of exercise data and track exercise progress over time. This connector also powers the\n\nStrava Quickstart\n\nin the Appstore, and can be used to create relevant cards from varying reports with very little effort.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Strava account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username or email address you use to log into Strava\n* The password you use to log into Strava\n\nYou can also\u00a0connect to your Strava account by signing into Facebook and\u00a0indicating that you want to create a connection to Strava.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0Strava Account\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0Strava Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0Strava connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0Strava accounts in Domo) to open the\u00a0Strava OAuth screen where you can enter your Strava credentials or sign into Facebook and create a connection to Strava.\u00a0Once you have\u00a0connected to\u00a0Strava\u00a0and authorized Domo to connect to Strava, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Strava DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0Strava when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Strava.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary menu,\n **Report**\n , along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select\u00a0a\u00a0Strava report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Friends\n  |\n Returns information about users being followed by the authenticated user.\n  |\n|\n My Activities\n  |\n Returns a list of activities for the authenticated user.\n  |\n|\n My Segments\n  |\n Returns a list of segments (specific sections of road) for the authenticated user.\n  |\n|\n Friend Activities\n  |\n Returns a list of activities for users being followed by the authenticated user.\n  |\n|\n Segment Leaderboards\n  |\n Returns rankings of athletes on specific segments (sections of road).\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Time Frame\n  |\n Select the time frame for the report. For example, if you selected\n **Month**\n , data for the last month would be imported.\n  |\n|\n Leaderboard Segments\n  |\n Enter a comma-separated list of segments (sections of road) you want to retrieve information for.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\n\n1. Ensure that the credentials correspond to the account you want to connect to.\n2. Verify that the data is updating as expected.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042931334\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003344\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nStrava Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,643\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "strava_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
