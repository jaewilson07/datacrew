This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0NOAA Weather Alerts connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The NOAA Weather Alerts connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is useful for getting severe weather alerts when planning outside events.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * HR roles, especially those involved in event planning\n* Anyone interested in getting weather alerts\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than 1 minute\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 1\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nNone. Because this data is public, there is no need to enter connection information.\n\n\n Details Pane\n--------------\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n State Name\n  |\n Select the State from the dropdown that you want to receive weather alerts for.\n  |\n\n\n Other Panes\n-------------\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Creating a NOAA\u00a0DataSet\n-------------------------\n\nTo create a NOAA Weather Alerts DataSet, simply select\u00a0the state or territory you wish to retrieve alerts for in the\n **State Name**\n menu in the\n **Details**\n pane.\u00a0Then schedule updates and name and describe your new DataSet in the\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n panes. These panes are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nReach out to DomoSupport if you experience issues with this connector. Because no credentials are needed, any issues that arise are likely be internal Domo issues or problems with the NOAA API.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043435493\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003372\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNOAA Weather Alerts Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,635\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "noaa_weather_alerts_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
