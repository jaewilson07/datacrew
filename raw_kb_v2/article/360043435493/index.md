Intro
-------

You can use Domo's NOAA Weather Alerts connector to retrieve weather alerts for any U.S. state or territory from the public National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data.


 You create an NOAA Weather Alerts DataSet in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the NOAA Weather Alerts connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

.


 The NOAA Weather Alerts connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

 Creating a NOAA DataSet
-------------------------

To create a NOAA Weather Alerts DataSet, simply select the state or territory you wish to retrieve alerts for in the
 **State Name**
 menu in the
 **Details**
 pane. Then schedule updates and name and describe your new DataSet in the
 **Scheduling**
 and

 panes. These panes are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

 Troubleshooting
-----------------

Reach out to DomoSupport if you experience issues with this connector. Because no credentials are needed, any issues that arise are likely be internal Domo issues or problems with the NOAA API.
