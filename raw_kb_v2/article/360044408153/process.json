This guide is intended to help you connect this app to your own data. If you have completed the purchasing process for this app or have purchased AppsPass, you will be able to go through all of the steps of this guide. The first steps are to make sure that the app and the app's DataFlow have been properly downloaded from the Appstore, and that your data is in the correct format to be used by the app.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Prerequisites:\n                       \n\n\n                         An understanding of the Appstore tool called Grid Builder. A walkthrough of how to use the Grid Builder can be found here:\n                         \n                          https://developer.domo.com/docs/installation-guides/grid-builder-walkthrough\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         Though not required, it is helpful to have a working knowledge of how a MySQL query works. More information can be found here:\n                         \n                          https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/mysql-tutorials.php\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n\n                        Below is a diagram that shows the order in which the customer data will be fed through the DataFlow and output to the app.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        When you are familiar with how the Grid Builder works, follow these steps to make sure that the app and the DataFlow are properly\u00a0deployed to your instance of Domo:\n                       \n\n\n                         Install the app\n                         \n\n                           If you purchased the app as part of AppsPass, make sure that you have clicked the install button in the AppsPass interface to deploy the app. This will take you to the Appstore where you can click the\n                           \n                            Try It\n                           \n                           button to deploy the app and the DataFlow to your instance. You will be asked to name the page where you'd like the app to appear in your instance of Domo.\n                          \n\n                           If you purchased through the Appstore, make sure you have clicked the\n                           \n                            Try It\n                           \n                           button on the page for this app in the Appstore to deploy the app and its DataFlow to your instance. You will be asked to name the page where you'd like the app to appear in your instance of Domo.\n                          \n\n\n\n                         Verify the DataFlow has deployed\n                         \n\n                           Double check that the DataFlow\u00a0has been deployed to your instance. To do this, navigate to the Data Center by clicking the menu button in the top right corner of Domo, then clicking the Data button located in the top left corner of Domo (see image below for example.)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Click\n                           \n                            DataFlows\n                           \n                           on the left side of the screen, then use the Data Center search bar to search for \"scorecard\". You should see a DataFlow that matches the name of the version of scorecard you downloaded. Ex. \"Helpdesk Scorecard\" or \"Sales Scorecard\"\n                          \n\n                           Alternatively, you can locate the DataFlow\u00a0using the following method. Navigate to the page where the app is deployed and click on the bottom banner of the app to access the app detail view. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you'll be able to see the DataSets that are powering the app. One of the DataSets should be named similarly to the app. Ex. \"Sales Scorecard\" or \"Retail Scorecard\". Click on that DataSet, and then click the wrench on the right side of the page, and then click\n                           \n                            Edit DataFlow\n                           \n                           in the dropdown. This will take you to the DataFlow for the app.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Step 1: Prepare Your Data\n                       \n\n                        The Scorecard App displays data filtered by date and grouped by a primary group (Sales Rep, Campaign, Helpdesk Rep, Store Location, etc.) This means that you need to get your data into a format where you have a column for dates and a column for your primary group with each row representing a member of your primary group on the respective date. Then the other columns in the data would be numeric columns for metrics you want to display in the app, or categorical columns that you would like to use as filtering options. See the example below.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Date\n                          \n\n                           Sales Rep\n                          \n\n                           Number of Sales\n                          \n\n                           Number of Leads\n                          \n\n                           Sales Amount\n                          \n\n                           Region\n                          \n\n\n\n                           01/01/2017\n                          \n\n                           Tim Dobbs\n                          \n\n                           4\n                          \n\n                           16\n                          \n\n                           $1,440\n                          \n\n                           NE\n                          \n\n\n\n                           01/01/2017\n                          \n\n                           Heather Smith\n                          \n\n                           7\n                          \n\n                           24\n                          \n\n                           $2,520\n                          \n\n                           NW\n                          \n\n\n\n                           02/01/2017\n                          \n\n                           Tim Dobbs\n                          \n\n                           6\n                          \n\n                           18\n                          \n\n                           $2,160\n                          \n\n                           NE\n                          \n\n\n\n                           02/01/2017\n                          \n\n                           Heather Smith\n                          \n\n                           3\n                          \n\n                           16\n                          \n\n                           $1,080\n                          \n\n                           NW\n                          \n\n\n\n                           03/01/2017\n                          \n\n                           Tim Dobbs\n                          \n\n                           9\n                          \n\n                           22\n                          \n\n                           $3,240\n                          \n\n                           NE\n                          \n\n\n\n                           03/01/2017\n                          \n\n                           Heather Smith\n                          \n\n                           11\n                          \n\n                           28\n                          \n\n                           $3,960\n                          \n\n                           NW\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        In this example, the Primary Group is \"Sales Rep\", there are three numeric columns that will be used to display metrics, and one categorical column that will be used as a filter. For a more robust example check out this spreadsheet\n                        \n                         here\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Protips:\n                            \n\n\n\n                             You can use more than one DataSet as source data for the app as long as they can be joined together using your date and primary group columns. Information on how to do joins in the grid builder will be found in the following sections.\n                            \n\n                             It is worth noting that the app can do simple calculations to calculate metrics. For example, the app could calculate leads to sales conversion rate for the above example using the following calculation: SUM(NumberOfSales)SUM(NumberOfLeads)*100. It is usually better to calculate ratios in the app later, rather than beforehand in the DataFlow. More on creating metric calculations in following sections.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Step 2: Add Your Source Data to the DataFlow\n                       \n\n                        As soon as you have prepared your data, you will need to navigate to the DataFlow and add your data as inputs to the DataFlow. Follow these steps to do so:\n                       \n\n\n                         Navigate to the Data Center by clicking the Data button located in the top left corner of Domo (see image below for example.)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Click\n                         \n                          DataFlows\n                         \n                         on the left side of the page, then search for \"Scorecard\" in the Data Center search bar. You should see a DataFlow named similarly to the version of the app you installed. Ex. \"Sales Scorecard\" or \"Campaign Scorecard\"\n                        \n\n                         Click on the DataFlow to go to the detail view, then click the pencil icon on the right side of the page to edit the DataFlow.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Remove the sample DataSet by clicking the\n                         \n                          x\n                         \n                         on the corner of the DataSet. The sample DataSet will be the one with the name that doesn't end in \"Grid Builder\" or \"Settings\".\u00a0Keep those other two DataSets as input.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Click the\n                         \n                          Select DataSet\n                         \n                         button, then add the DataSets here that you prepared for the app.\n                        \n\n                         After you have added your DataSets, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the\n                         \n                          Save\n                         \n                         button.\n                        \n\n                         Navigate back to the Data Center.\n                        \n\n\n                        Step 3: Edit the Grid Builder\n                       \n\n                        For this step, you will need to edit the appropriate fields in the grid builder to match you input data. This guide presents a basic set of steps here, but for a more comprehensive tutorial on how the Grid Builder works, please review the\n                        \n                         Grid Builder Walkthrough\n                        \n                        . As you make changes, it may be wise to occasionally copy your work into an Excel sheet to track your changes, in case the web browser encounters any errors.\n                       \n\n                        Follow these steps to edit the grid builder:\n                       \n\n\n                         Navigate to the Grid Builder webform that came with the app. It will be named after the version of scorecard you installed plus \"-Grid Builder\" on the end. Ex. \"Sales Scorecard - Grid Builder\". Click\n                         \n                          DataSets\n                         \n                         on the left side of the Data Center and search for that name. Click the DataSet, then in the details view, click the wrench button on the right side, then click\n                         \n                          Edit Webform\n                         \n                         .\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         You most likely won't need to change the date range options, so don't change any of the calendar information on the first few rows (rows C101 through C108). If you do need to change the date filters refer to the Grid Builder Walkthrough for instructions.\n                        \n\n                         Under the \"FROM\" column, change the value on row C201 to match the name of your first DataSet (#1 in example image below.)\n                        \n\n                         Under the \"SELECT\" column from C201 on down, replace these sample values with the names of the columns from the DataSet you named in the \"FROM\" column that you would like to use in the app. You may have more or less entries than the sample information, so you may need to add rows or delete extra information from the sample rows (#2 in example image below.)\n                        \n\n                         Under the \u201cAS\u201d column from C201 on down, choose names for the columns that you listed in the \u201cSELECT\u201d column. Avoid using spaces, numbers, and special characters in the names here. For example, use Gross_Sales as opposed to Gross Sales. This will make later steps easier (#3 in example image below.)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         The app requires a specific field to function called the \u201cPhotoUrl\u201d field. Add one more row at the end of this grouping. Assign it a number in the \u201cC\u201d column. If your customer has a column with photo URLs then use that in the \u201cSELECT\u201d column. Otherwise, put two single quotes in that column (\u2018\u2019). Put \u201cPhotoUrl\u201d in the \u201cAS\u201d column. This is case sensitive, so make sure that only the \u201cP\u201d and \u201cU\u201d are capitalized (#4 in example image.)\n                        \n\n                         Under the \u201cInclude\u201d column place a 1 in each row that you are including from your data that isn\u2019t being used solely for a join. This is generally everything except your date field, since the date is also coming from the calendar that the app generates (#5 in example image.)\n                        \n\n                         Double check the JoinType and JoinCondition columns on row C201. When joining with the calendar, typically, use \u201cINNER\u201d for JoinType and make sure the JoinCondition references the row where your date column is brought in from your DataSet (#6 in example image.)\n                        \n\n                         Repeat this process for any additional DataSet that you bring in. Each new DataSet should be assigned the next 100\u2019s value under the \u201cC\u201d column. Ex. Start with 301 for the second DataSet, 401 for the third, etc. Additional joins usually use \u201cLEFT\u201d for the JoinType and join on date and your primary group from your first DataSet. Ex C201 = C301 AND C202 = C302 (If 201 and 301 were both the primary and 202 and 302 were both the date.)\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         As soon as you have the information entered for your DataSets you\u2019ll need to configure your filters. On each row of the grid builder that references a column in your data that you would like to use as a filter you\u2019ll need to update the five filter columns, \u201cFilterId\u201d, \u201cFilterName\u201d, \u201cFilterInputType\u201d, \u201cFilterIsPrimary\u201d, and \u201cFilterIsPrimaryGroup\u201d.\n                        \n\n                         On the row that references your Primary Group, use \u201c2\u201d for the FilterID, choose a name under FilterName, \u201cMulti Select\u201d for FilterInputType, and put a \u201c1\u201d in the FilterIsPrimary.\n                        \n\n                         On other rows that you would like to use as filters, use incrementing numbers for the FilterID (3,4,5 etc.) choose names under FilterName, use \u201cMulti Select\u201d or \u201cSingle Select\u201d for FilterInputType (Check out the Grid Builder Walkthrough for more information on what the two filter types do,) leave FilterIsPrimary empty for these rows, then add incrementing numbers under FilterIsPrimaryGroup for any rows that reference columns that you\u2019d like to use as alternative Primary Groups in the app.\n                        \n\n                         Click\n                         \n                          Save & Continue\n                         \n                         at the top of the page to save the DataSet.\n                        \n\n\n                        As soon as you've made changes to the grid builder, go to the Data Center and run the Scorecard DataFlow. If the DataFlow\u00a0runs successfully, you've most likely filled out the grid builder correctly. If you encountered errors, review the Grid Builder Walkthrough, or contact Technical Support.

Follow these steps to edit the Metrics form:\n                       \n\n\n                         Adding standard metrics:\n                        \n\n\n\n                         In the Data Center, navigate to the metrics form. It will be named similarly to the grid builder, with the name of the version of scorecard that you installed, followed by \u201c- Metrics\u201d. Ex. \u201cHelpdesk Scorecard \u2013 Metrics\u201d.\n                        \n\n                         Click on the DataSet and then click on the wrench to edit the webform.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         For each metric you would like to display in the app, fill out a row in this form. The first column is the \u201cName\u201d column. Enter the name for the metric you would like to see in the app.\n                        \n\n                         In the \u201cCalculation\u201d column, enter the calculation for the metric. Only simple calculations are supported. You can use simple sums, averages, max, and min (\u201cSUM(column)\u201d or \u201cAVG(column)\u201d), simple single operations (\u201cSUM(columnA) + SUM(column)\u201d or \u201cSUM(columnA) * MIN(columnB)\u201d, etc. ), or ratio calculations (\u201cSUM(columnA)/SUM(columnB)*100\u201d). More complicated calculations will need to be calculated in part beforehand in the grid builder.\n                        \n\n                         In the DataType column, enter \u201cCurrency\u201d, \u201cNumber\u201d or \u201cPercent\u201d. This tells the app how to display your metric.\n                        \n\n                         In the \u201cSortHighToLow\u201d column, put \u201ctrue\u201d if you want the metric\u2019s bar chart to display from highest to lowest, or input \u201cfalse\u201d if you\u2019d like the metric\u2019s bar chart to display lowest to highest.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cUnitOfMeasurement\u201d write the unit of the metric. Ex. Dollars, People, Referrals, etc. May be left blank.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cDescription\u201d write a short description of the metric. May be left blank.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cBookmarks\u201d, enter the name of the Bookmark that you would like the metric to be a part of. This is where bookmarks are created for the app. You may name your bookmarks anything that you\u2019d like. Metrics can be part of more than one bookmark, simply list all of the bookmarks you\u2019d like the metric to be a part of separated by commas (no spaces.)\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cDecimal\u201d list the number of decimals you\u2019d like to display for that metric. The options are 0,1 and 2. Leaving this blank defaults to 2 decimal places.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cIsDetail\u201d write \u201cFALSE\u201d for all standard metrics. This is used when adding a detail view to the app which is detailed below.\n                        \n\n\n\n                         Adding detail views and metrics:\n                        \n\n\n                        Detail views and detail metrics appear in the detail window when a specific member of your primary group is clicked.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        There are a handful of options for detail views that you can create, including Single Values such as text, currency, numbers and percents, as well as pie and line charts. To create a detail view follow the steps below:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Single Value Details:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          To create a single value detail view, first, under the \u201cName\u201d column enter the name you want to use to label your detail, then leave the other columns before \u201cIsDetail\u201d blank.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Under \u201cIsDetail\u201d write \u201cTRUE\u201d.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Under \u201cDetailType\u201d you can use the following option to choose the format of your single value detail: \u201csingle value\u201d, \u201ctext\u201d, \u201ccurrency\u201d, \u201cpercent\u201d, and \u201cnumber\u201d.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Leave \u201cDetailGroup\u201d and \u201cDetailItem\u201d blank.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Under \u201cDetailValue\u201d either enter a calculation for a numeric detail, or enter DISTINCT(column) for a text value.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          Under \u201cDetailDimensions\u201d use a comma separated list (no spaces) of the different primary groupings to which you\u2019d like to apply this detail. Use the same values that were entered in the \u201cFilterName\u201d column in the grid builder.\n                          \n\n\n\n\n                        Chart Details:\n                       \n\n\n                         Under the \u201cName\u201d column enter the name you want to use to label your detail, then leave the other columns before \u201cIsDetail\u201d blank.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cIsDetail\u201d write \u201cTRUE\u201d.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cDetailType\u201d use \u201cpie\u201d for a pie chart, or use \u201cline\u201d for a line graph.\n                        \n\n                         Leave \u201cDetailGroup\u201d blank.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cDetailItem\u201d if you are creating a pie chart use \u201cGROUP_BY(column)\u201d, choosing a column in your data that you would like to use as the different pieces of the pie chart. If you are creating a line graph use \u201cDATE_GRAIN(dateColumn)\u201d choosing a column that represents the date grain you\u2019d like to use for the chart.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cDetailValue\u201d enter the calculation of the metric you\u2019d like to track.\n                        \n\n                         Under \u201cDetailDimensions\u201d use a comma separated list (no spaces) of the different primary groupings to which you\u2019d like to apply this detail. Use the same values that were entered in the \u201cFilterName\u201d column in the grid builder.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Step 5: Validation\n                       \n\n                        Now that you have configured the grid builder and the metrics forms, you should be ready to check your app to validate your metrics. We suggest the following process to validate:\n                       \n\n\n                         Build KPI cards to test metrics. Build these cards based off of your source data, not the output of the app. As an example, if you are displaying trending sales by sales rep in the app, build a\u00a0bar chart type card that displays sales per rep, and have the date range of the KPI card match one of the date ranges the app displays.\n                        \n\n                         Compare your data between the KPI cards and the app. Remember to make sure your filtering options and date ranges match between the app and the card.\n                        \n\n                         If you find discrepancies, check if you need to change join conditions or groupings in the grid builder and double check your calculations.\n                        \n\n                         Repeat this process for any metrics you need to validate.\n                        \n\n\n                        Congratulations!\n                       \n\n                        Your Scorecard App should be good to go!
