Use Domo's Pinterest\u00a0Ads connector to retrieve delivery metrics and object information for your Pinterest\u00a0Ads account. To learn more about the Pinterest API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/?\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Pinterest account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Pinterest Ads connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Pinterest account and create a DataSet, you must have credentials for the account (the email address you use to log into Pinterest and your Pinterest password) OR Facebook or Google credentials.\n\n\n Connecting to your Pinterest account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Pinterest\u00a0Ads Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials pane\n\nThe Domo Pinterest\u00a0Ads connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Pinterest\u00a0Ads accounts in Domo) to open the Pinterest OAuth screen where you can enter your Pinterest credentials. Once you have entered valid Pinterest credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Pinterest\u00a0Ads DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Pinterest when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Pinterest.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Pinterest report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Board Details\n  |\n This report returns a board object.\n  |\n|\n Board Pins\n  |\n This report returns a board's pin objects.\n  |\n|\n Conversion Quality Health Metrics\n  |\n This report returns a list of conversion quality health metrics.\n  |\n|\n Delivery Metrics\n  |\n This report returns delivery metrics for the selected object.

You can revoke Domo's access to your Pinterest account at any time.\n\n###\n How often can the data be updated?\n\nDataSets should be set to update once a day.\n\n###\n Are there any API limits I should be aware of?\n\nPinterest allows up to 1000 API requests for a user per hour. A single dataset run may need to make multiple requests.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043434553\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003457\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nPinterest Ads Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,721\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:13 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "pinterest_ads_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
