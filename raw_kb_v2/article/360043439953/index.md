 alerts

 the user can set
	+ The

 date range

 refresh rate
	+ Who the card is audited by
* Use an appropriate chart type with...

+ A descriptive title
	+ Named axes
	+ Consistent

 formatting

 with other cards in the collection (for example, blue line = forecast, green bar = current, and so on)
	+ A

 goal line

* Use an appropriate

for the data represented in the card.
* Ensure the card is

linked to other appropriate content

owner

(the person responsible for answering questions about the card).
