You can use\u00a0Domo's\u00a0RunKeeper\u00a0connector to\u00a0compile reports\u00a0about\u00a0physical activity, health, and nutrition.\u00a0To learn more about the\u00a0RunKeeper API, visit their\u00a0page (\n\nhttp://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/\n\n).\n\n\n The RunKeeper connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your\u00a0RunKeeper account in the\n\nData Center\n\n. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the\u00a0RunKeeper connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n | * Monitoring fitness over time and exercise trends\n* Competition between friends and coworkers about running data\n |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Distance traveled\n* Time of activity\n* Average pace\n* Location of activity\n* Friends'\u00a0activities\n* Rankings\n* Type of activity\n* Sleep\n* Nutrition data\n* Weight data\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * HR roles\n* Anyone who wants to keep track of health and fitness data\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 5 minutes\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 2\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Authenticate when you create the DataSet.\n* Use the\n\nRunKeeper QuickStart App\n\nto quickly generate relevant cards and metrics from different connector reports.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0RunKeeper account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The\u00a0email address you use to log into RunKeeper\n* The password you use to log into RunKeeper\n\nYou can also\u00a0connect to your\u00a0RunKeeper account by signing into Facebook or Google+ and\u00a0indicating that you want to create a connection to RunKeeper.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\u00a0RunKeeper Account\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\u00a0RunKeeper Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo\u00a0RunKeeper connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing\u00a0RunKeeper accounts in Domo) to open the\u00a0RunKeeper OAuth screen where you can choose whether to connect to\u00a0RunKeeper by entering your RunKeeper, Facebook,\u00a0or\u00a0Google+ credentials.\u00a0Once you have\u00a0connected to\u00a0RunKeeper\u00a0and authorized Domo to connect to RunKeeper, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0RunKeeper DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0you are already logged into\u00a0RunKeeper when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click Add account. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of RunKeeper.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0a primary menu,\n **Report**\n , along with two fields for entering timeframe data.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select\u00a0a\u00a0RunKeeper report. The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Background Activities\n  |\n Returns information about physical activity that occurs normally throughout the day, such as calories burned and steps taken.\n  |\n|\n Diabetes Measurements\n  |\n Returns metrics about\u00a0the user's blood glucose and hormone levels.\n  |\n|\n Fitness Activities\n  |\n Returns activities that appear in\u00a0the user's fitness feed on the RunKeeper website.\n  |\n|\n Friends\n  |\n Returns the user's list of friends, with user ID, full name, profile URL, and status (pending or member).\n  |\n|\n General Body Measurements\n  |\n Returns body measurements such as blood pressure, cholesterol, vitamin intake, white cell count, etc.\n  |\n|\n Nutrition\n  |\n Returns statistics about the\u00a0user's diet.\n  |\n|\n Personal Records\n  |\n Returns a list of the user's personal best records.\n  |\n|\n Profile\n  |\n Returns the user's profile information, such as identity, geographical location, and fitness goals.\n  |\n|\n Settings\n  |\n Returns the user's sharing and display preferences.\n  |\n|\n Sleep\n  |\n Returns sleep statistics for the user, such as the length of time spent in various sleep stages and the number of times awoken during the night.\n  |\n|\n Strength Training Activities\n  |\n Returns information about\u00a0the user's strength training activities.\n  |\n|\n Weight\n  |\n Returns statistics about the user's weight and body mass in kilograms.\n  |\n\n\n |\n|\n Start Days\n  |\n Enter the number of the farthest day back that should be represented in the report.

For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Start Days**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **End Days**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\u00a0Enter\n\n0\n\nfor\u00a0today.\n  |\n|\n End Days\n  |\n Enter the number of the most recent day back that should be represented in the report. Combine with\n **Start Days**\n to create a range of represented days. For example, if you entered\n\n10\n\nfor\n **Start Days**\n and\n\n5\n\nfor\n **End Days**\n , the report would contain data for\u00a010 days ago up until\u00a05 days ago.\u00a0Enter\n\n0\n\nfor\u00a0today.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding\u00a0a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Troubleshooting\n-----------------\n\nEnsure you are using the correct credentials.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042931314\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003337\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nRunKeeper Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,648\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:12 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "runkeeper_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "api_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoQGAS"}]}
