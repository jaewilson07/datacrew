RunKeeper is a GPS fitness-tracking app for iOS and Android. It allows users to track fitness activities using GPS and to see detailed statistics around their pace, distance, and time. You can use Domo's RunKeeper connector to compile reports about physical activity, health, and nutrition. To learn more about the RunKeeper API, visit their page (

http://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/

).


 The RunKeeper connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your RunKeeper account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the RunKeeper connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Best Practices
----------------


* Authenticate when you create the DataSet.
* Use the

RunKeeper QuickStart App

to quickly generate relevant cards and metrics from different connector reports.

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your RunKeeper account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:

 The email address you use to log into RunKeeper
* The password you use to log into RunKeeper

You can also connect to your RunKeeper account by signing into Facebook or Google+ and indicating that you want to create a connection to RunKeeper.


 Connecting to Your RunKeeper Account
--------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the RunKeeper Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo RunKeeper connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing RunKeeper accounts in Domo) to open the RunKeeper OAuth screen where you can choose whether to connect to RunKeeper by entering your RunKeeper, Facebook, or Google+ credentials. Once you have connected to RunKeeper and authorized Domo to connect to RunKeeper, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new RunKeeper DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into RunKeeper when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click Add account. If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of RunKeeper.
