Intro
-------

Autodesk BIM 360   is a construction project management platform that allows you to manage and analyze construction projects from the job site or the office.  To learn more about the BIM 360 API, visit their page (

).


 You connect to your BIM 360 account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the BIM 360 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your BIM 360 account and create a DataSet, you must have a BIM 360 username and password.
