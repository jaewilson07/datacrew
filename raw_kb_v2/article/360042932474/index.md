Intro
-------

Use this connector to export your data from a

Domo


 DataSet

to an

SFTP

server. To learn more about SFTP, visit the Wikipedia page at

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH\_Fi...nsfer\_Protocol

.


 You export data to an SFTP server in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the SFTP Writeback connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

*Note:**
 The owner of a writeback dataset must also be an owner or co-owner of the input dataset.

Prerequisites
---------------

To configure this connector, you will need the following:

 A Domo Client ID and Client Secret.
* Your SFTP server hostname.

*Important:**
 The SFTP Server host name must have
 **sftp://**
 in the beginning of the URL and should not end with a
 **front slash (/)**
 .
* Your SFTP server port number.
* Your SFTP server username and password.
* Your SFTP server SSH private key.
* The passphrase for your SSH private key.

*Note: Domo does not support the SSH keys generated using ssh-keygen. The SSH keys need to be the DES or RSA keys (in PEM format) generated by OpenSSL.**


 OpenSSH private key format can be converted using ssh-keygen utility to the old PEM format.


```
 ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```


 This will update the same file with the RSA key.

##
 To obtain your Domo Client ID and Client Secret, do the following:


1. Login to

Domo developer account.
2. In the top right corner under


**My Account,**


 click


**New Client.**
3. Enter the application name and description.
4. Provide the application scope by selecting
 **Account**
 ,
 **Data**
 , and
 **User**
 .
5. Click


**Create.**
6. Once you have created a client, you can manage the client by clicking on

*Manage Client.**
7. Your

*Client Secret**

will appear in the

*Manage Client**

section.

Configuring the Connection
----------------------------


 This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the SFTP Writeback Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


###

Credentials Pane


 This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Domo developer account as well as your SFTP server. Depending on the configuration of the SFTP server, you may need either a Private Key and Passphrase, username and password, or both. The following table describes what is needed for each field:


|

|
 Hostname
  |
 Enter your SFTP server hostname.

*Important:**
 The SFTP Server host name must have
 **sftp://**
 in the beginning of the URL and should not end with a
 **front slash (/)**
