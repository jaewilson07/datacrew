To learn more about the Harvest API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://help.getharvest.com/api/\n\n).\n\n\n You connect to your Harvest account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Harvest connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Harvest account and create a DataSet, you must have your Harvest username and password OR a Google account. You must also know the name of your Harvest instance, as this is required for all reports. This is your company name as it appears in your Harvest URL. For example, if your URL was\n\n\n domo.harvestapp.com\n\n\n , the instance would be\n\ndomo\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your Harvest Account\n------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Harvest Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet\n\n,**\n are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThe Domo Harvest connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click\n **Connect**\n (or select\n **Add Account**\n if\u00a0you have\u00a0existing Harvest accounts in Domo) to open the Harvest OAuth screen where you can enter your Harvest username and password. (You can also enter Google credentials to authenticate.) Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Harvest DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n*Note:**\n If you are already logged into Harvest when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click\n **Add account**\n . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Harvest.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Harvest report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n All Projects Time Entries\n  |\n Retrieve time entries for all projects in a specified time period.\n  |\n|\n All Projects Logged Expenses\n  |\n List all logged expenses for all projects in a specified time period.\n  |\n|\n All Users Logged Expenses\n  |\n List all expenses logged by users.\n  |\n|\n All Users Time Entries\n  |\n List all users' time entries.\n  |\n|\n Assignments\n  |\n List all task assignments for all projects in a specified time period.\n  |\n|\n Clients\n  |\n List all clients.\n  |\n|\n Contacts\n  |\n List all contacts.\n  |\n|\n Daily\n  |\n List all time entries.\n  |\n|\n Expense Categories\n  |\n List all expense categories.\n  |\n|\n Invoices\n  |\n List all invoices.\n  |\n|\n Invoice Messages\n  |\n List invoice messages.\n  |\n|\n Invoice Payments\n  |\n List invoice payments.\n  |\n|\n Invoice Item Categories\n  |\n List invoice item categories.\n  |\n|\n People\n  |\n List all users.\n  |\n|\n Projects\n  |\n List all projects.\n  |\n|\n Project Expenses\n  |\n List all projects' logged expenses.\n  |\n|\n Tasks\n  |\n List all tasks.\n  |\n|\n User Expenses\n  |\n List all user expenses.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Instance\n  |\n Enter your Harvest instance name.
