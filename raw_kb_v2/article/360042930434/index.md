Intro
-------

Harvest offers time tracking, invoicing, expense tracking, and time-based reporting. To learn more about the Harvest API, visit their page (

http://help.getharvest.com/api/

).


 You connect to your Harvest account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Harvest connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Harvest account and create a DataSet, you must have your Harvest username and password OR a Google account. You must also know the name of your Harvest instance, as this is required for all reports. This is your company name as it appears in your Harvest URL. For example, if your URL was


 domo.harvestapp.com


 , the instance would be

domo

.


 Connecting to Your Harvest Account
------------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Harvest Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet

,**
 are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Harvest connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Harvest accounts in Domo) to open the Harvest OAuth screen where you can enter your Harvest username and password. (You can also enter Google credentials to authenticate.) Once you have entered valid credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Harvest DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

*Note:**
 If you are already logged into Harvest when you connect in Domo, you are authenticated automatically when you click
 **Add account**
 . If you want to connect to an account that is different from the one you are logged into, you must first log out of Harvest.


###
