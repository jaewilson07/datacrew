To fix this, change the name or code for that area of the map. Refer to the list of supported names and codes for the map you are using.

The default security roles in Domo are Admin, Privileged, Editor, Participant, and Social. Each security role has specific grants to certain features. Users with Participant and Social roles generally have view-only\u00a0access. Users with an Admin role have access to all features, cards, and dashboards in their company instance.\n                        \n\n                        For a list of grants in Domo and the associated access levels, see\n                        \n                         Default Security Role Reference\n                        \n                        . You can also create custom roles in which you specify the privileges available to users with that role.

Large Sumo and Table Cards are especially affected and may have slower load times.\n                        \n                        To resolve this issue, we recommend switching to another browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. If this is not feasible, you can try reducing the number of columns or rows in your Sumo Cards and Tables.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        Sorting Errors\n                       \n\n                        Unable to sort in Pie or Donut graph\n                       \n\n                        By default you\u00a0cannot\u00a0use the\n                        \n\n                          Sorting\n                         \n\n                        menu to change the order in which slices appear in Pie and Donut graphs.
