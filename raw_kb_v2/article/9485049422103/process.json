The owner of that DataSet is the user who first created that instance of the Form Builder or Form Viewer app. This is because in the AppDB system, where collections are stored, the collection owner and the DataSet owner must match for successful exporting.\n\n\n The data is exported every 15 minutes based on AppDB's default.\n\n\n The table below provides a reference for the response data.\n\n\n Response Data Reference\n-------------------------\n\n\n|\n |\n Column\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|\n Form-level Attributes\n  |\n Form ID\n  |\n Unique identifier (GUID) of the form\n  |\n|\n Form Name\n  |\n Form name as defined in the form editor\n  |\n|\n Description\n  |\n Form description as defined in the form editor\n  |\n|\n Tags\n  |\n Tags as defined in the form editor\n  |\n|\n Response Type\n  |\n Response type mode (Ex: Single response, Multiple response)\n  |\n|\n User Attributes\n  |\n User ID\n  |\n Domo user ID of the user who entered form responses\n  |\n|\n User Name\n  |\n User name of the user who entered form responses\n  |\n|\n Section-level Attributes\n  |\n Section ID\n  |\n Unique identifier (GUID) of the section.
