Intro
-------

When a form is used in

Form Viewer,

a DataSet is created with the responses. The owner of that DataSet is the user who first created that instance of the Form Builder or Form Viewer app. This is because in the AppDB system, where collections are stored, the collection owner and the DataSet owner must match for successful exporting.


 The data is exported every 15 minutes based on AppDB's default.


 The table below provides a reference for the response data.
