For information about the basic version, see\n\nShopify Connector\n\n.\n\n\n The Shopify Custom connector integrates Shopify data, including data on customers, orders, marketing efforts, pages, and more. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Shopify Custom connector user interface. For general information about adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for retrieving data for ecommerce sales, inventory, deliveries, and the like. It also supports blog and marketing information.\n  |\n| **Primary Metrics**  |\n Returns sales information for your ecommerce shop. You can also get metrics on the blog and marketing side of your business.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Warehouse managers\n* Ecommerce shop admins\n* Online sales\n* Owner/C-Suite\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Depends on the date range, but generally between 1 and 3 hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 6\n  |\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your\u00a0Shopify Custom account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The name of your shop.\n* The email address and password associated with your Shopify account.\n* The Admin API access token.\n\nConnecting to Your\u00a0Shopify Custom App Account\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Shopify Custom Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n##\n Credentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains\u00a0two fields where you enter the name of your shop.\u00a0 and the Admin API access token. You can find out the name of your shop by looking at your Shopify URL. For example, in the Shopify URL\n\n\n domo.shopify.com\n\n\n , the shop name would be\n\ndomo\n\n. The Admin API Access can be generated by creating and installing the app and then making an authentication request. For more details, see\n\nCreate and install a custom app\n\n.\n\n\n In the Microsoft OAuth page, enter the username and password for your shop.\n\n\n After you have entered valid\u00a0Shopify credentials, you can use the same account in Domo any time you create a Shopify\u00a0DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the\n\nData Center\n\n.
