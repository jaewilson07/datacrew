These improvements include...\n\n\n* **Ability to edit messages**\n . Edit mistakes out of your messages after you have posted them.\n* **Mention filter that sorts based on category**\n . @-mentioning in Buzz now filters based on category to allow you to more easily navigate to that card or group you are looking for.\n* **Display who is online**\n . Just like in your old DomoBuzz, you can see who in your organization is logged into Domo. For more information, see\n\nSeeing Online Users in Domo\n\n.\n* **Ability to collapse attachments**\n . Hide attachments and GIFs that may be distracting you.\n\n\n For more information, see\n\nBuzz Layout\n\n\n .\n\n##\n Hybrid SSO\n\n\n Hybrid SSO allows users with Single Sign-On enabled to specify which of their users can log in directly to Domo.\n\n\n Previously, hybrid SSO was available only to Administrators using a feature switch. For SSO customers trying to grant Domo access to contractors or non-employees, this often created a dilemma because such users were not usually given accounts in the company\u2019s email or directory system. Now, however, Admins can go into the\n **Single Sign-On**\n tab in the Admin Settings and specify a set of users who are able to sign into Domo directly, just as they would without SSO enabled. Users can then toggle login modes (Direct or Single Sign-on) from the Domo login screen.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nAdding Users to Direct Sign-On\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nApp Deploy Improvements\n\n\n For this release we are pushing the following improvements to our App deploy process:\n\n\n* Support for multi-connector content.\u00a0 Apps can now be powered by 1:n connectors, providing a simple-to-understand interface.\n* Multi-user deploy capability. With more complicated Apps, it\u2019s unlikely a single person has all the credentials needed to be successful.\u00a0 We\u2019ve leveraged Buzz and added the ability to collaborate in the power-up process. You can assign specific portions to the right person.\u00a0 This effectively removes the need for sticky notes and other uncomfortable requests for credentials.\n\n\n###\n Updated UI for Google Analytics Connector\n\nThe user interface for the Google Analytics connector now offers a more intuitive, step-by-step workflow. Instead of providing a single pane for selecting parameters and report types, the new interface divides up options between five panes\u2014\n **Select Views**\n ,\n **Select Reports**\n ,\n **Select Segments**\n ,\n **Select Duration**\n , and\n **Test My Configuration**\n .\n\n\n The following screenshot shows the new view for selecting Google Analytics reports in Domo:\n\nFor more information including FAQs, see\n\nGoogle Analytics Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Page and Card Analyzer Filter Search Box\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you add a filter to a page or card, you can now more easily find the columns you're looking for using a new search box.\n\nGetting Help\n--------------\n\nYou can view the latest release notes information in the Help Center, which you can access from Domo by clicking\n\n*> Help Center**\n .\n\n\n If you have questions about Domo,\n\n search for a topic in the Help Center\n* train in Domo University at\n\nhttp://www.domo.com/university\n* get answers in the Domo Community at\n\ndojo.domo.com\n* contact Technical Support by entering a help ticket in the Domo Support Portal, by sending a Buzz message to\n\n\\support\n\n, or by emailing\n\nsupport@domo.com\n\n.\n* reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager or Technical Consultant\n\nIf you have feedback, please send it from within Domo (\n\n*> Feedback**\n ).
