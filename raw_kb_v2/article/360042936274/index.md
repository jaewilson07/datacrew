##

Buzz Updates


 Based on your feedback, Buzz has been updated to include a number of improvements to facilitate your communication. These improvements include...


* **Ability to edit messages**
 . Edit mistakes out of your messages after you have posted them.
* **Mention filter that sorts based on category**
 . @-mentioning in Buzz now filters based on category to allow you to more easily navigate to that card or group you are looking for.
* **Display who is online**
 . Just like in your old DomoBuzz, you can see who in your organization is logged into Domo. For more information, see

Seeing Online Users in Domo

.
* **Ability to collapse attachments**
 . Hide attachments and GIFs that may be distracting you.

##
 Hybrid SSO


 Hybrid SSO allows users with Single Sign-On enabled to specify which of their users can log in directly to Domo.


 Previously, hybrid SSO was available only to Administrators using a feature switch. For SSO customers trying to grant Domo access to contractors or non-employees, this often created a dilemma because such users were not usually given accounts in the company’s email or directory system. Now, however, Admins can go into the
 **Single Sign-On**
 tab in the Admin Settings and specify a set of users who are able to sign into Domo directly, just as they would without SSO enabled. Users can then toggle login modes (Direct or Single Sign-on) from the Domo login screen.

Adding Users to Direct Sign-On

App Deploy Improvements


 For this release we are pushing the following improvements to our App deploy process:


* Support for multi-connector content.  Apps can now be powered by 1:n connectors, providing a simple-to-understand interface.
* Multi-user deploy capability. With more complicated Apps, it’s unlikely a single person has all the credentials needed to be successful.  We’ve leveraged Buzz and added the ability to collaborate in the power-up process. You can assign specific portions to the right person.  This effectively removes the need for sticky notes and other uncomfortable requests for credentials.


###
 Updated UI for Google Analytics Connector

The user interface for the Google Analytics connector now offers a more intuitive, step-by-step workflow. Instead of providing a single pane for selecting parameters and report types, the new interface divides up options between five panes—
 **Select Views**
 ,
 **Select Reports**
 ,
 **Select Segments**
 ,
 **Select Duration**
 , and
 **Test My Configuration**
 .


 The following screenshot shows the new view for selecting Google Analytics reports in Domo:

 Page and Card Analyzer Filter Search Box
------------------------------------------

When you add a filter to a page or card, you can now more easily find the columns you're looking for using a new search box.
