Anyone attempting to access the building will be stopped and go through a simple check-in process where they answer a few questions and have their temperature taken. According to their responses, they will be either allowed or denied access to the premises.\n                       \n\n                        This check-in consists of questions that are fully customizable by you\u00a0and deemed necessary to ensure the safety of everyone in your unique office environment. Once the temperature of the employee or guest is taken, the person scanning at\u00a0the entry point to the office will mark whether the temperature is above or below a certain temperature determined by you. This will be the primary deciding factor on whether the person is allowed to enter or not.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              Note:\n                             \n                             This app\u00a0is part of the\n                             \n                              Get Back to Work Solution\n                             \n                             and is\u00a0available\n                             \n                              on-demand and paid\n                             \n                             .\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            To request this feature be enabled,\n                           \n\n\n\n                              Reach out to your Domo Customer Success Manager\u00a0or Account Executive.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n                               If you do not have contact information for your CSM or AE, contact Domo Support.

Like the Safe Worker questions, a yes indicates a failed check-in while a no indicates a passed check-in.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Admin settings\n                       \n\n                        Those who are authorized to use and configure the app will be able to set the devices check-in location, the temperature threshold, the accepted entry message, and the denied entry message.\n                       \n\n                        Device location\n                       \n\n                        The device's location is unique to each individual device, so you can have as many devices as you want for each of your business' entrances. Use the drop-downs to select where exactly the device is set to be, the granularity for these drop-downs is set in the initial app set-up.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Accepted entry\n                       \n\n                        Admins can also set the app's\u00a0messaging for an accepted entry. Include a title and an optional description. Please note that you must confirm that you understand that the messaging will be set for the entire company, meaning that every device will have the same messaging.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        Denied entry\n                       \n\n                        Admins can also set the app's\u00a0messaging for a denied\u00a0entry.

However, if a company decides that the temperature questions in Safe Worker check-ins are enough, they can modify the QR code scan to merely confirm presence at specific entrances in the office. That is important for identifying cohorts for contact tracing.\n                       \n\n                        What happens if an employee failed the Temperature Scanning, how will you notify us?\n                       \n\n                        Our entrance assessment app will notify a person or group of admins in charge of the Get Back to Work Solution that a person has been flagged a potential risk so that you can take the corrective next steps.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360056653514", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
