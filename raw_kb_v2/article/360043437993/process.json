Embedded content is then served to the end user via either the Javascript API or iFrames. You can pair private embed with PDP to serve appropriate content to end users, including external end users. If you use embed to serve content to external end users, one of two methods is preferred:\n                       \n\n\n                         Embed cards from a white-labeled subscriber instance.
