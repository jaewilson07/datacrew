You can use Domo\u2019s Eloqua connector to compile reports on marketing statistics such as contacts, emails opened, website visits, subscribes and unsubscribes, and so on.\u00a0To learn more about the Eloqua API, visit their page (\n\nhttps://community.oracle.com/community/topliners/code-it\n\n).\n\nThe Eloqua connector is a \"Cloud App\" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking\n **Cloud App**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\nYou connect to your Eloqua account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Eloqua connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is appropriate for web analytics and digital marketing use cases.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n | * Sends\n* Opens\n* Clicks\n* Impressions\n* Form fills\n* Web visits\n* Landing page visits\n* Unsubscribes\n* Subscribes\n* Contacts\n |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Digital marketers\n* Marketing directors\n* Marketing analysts\n* CMOs\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n 50+ hours\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 6\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\n\n* Set your \"Contacts\" report to\n **Replace**\n , not\n **Append**\n (as \"Contacts\" may change over time).\n* You may need to make recursive DataFlow if you need a historical record of your contacts. For more information, see\n\nCreating a Recursive/Snapshot Magic ETL DataFlow\n\n.\n* For the \"Activities\" report, set your connector to pull a full history, then reconfigure to do a daily Append (this will let you keep your historical data and move forward and diminish runtime).\n* If you need to join \"Activities\" to \"Contacts\" reports (\"Form Submits,\" \"Email Sends,\" \"Email Click-throughs,\" and \"Email Opens\"), join on the \"CONTACT ID\" and to the \"ID\" fields.\n* For subscribes, unsubscribes, and bouncebacks, join on \"EMAIL ADDRESS.\"\n\n\n Prerequisites\n----------------\n\n\n To connect to your Eloqua account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n\n* The username for your Eloqua account\n* The password for your Eloqua account\n* The company name associated with your Eloqua account\n\n\n Connecting to Your Eloqua Account\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Eloqua Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Eloqua account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\n*Field**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n\nCompany\n\n|\n\nEnter the company name associated with your Eloqua account.\n\n|\n|\n\nUsername\n\n|\n\nEnter the username you use to log into your Eloqua account.\n\n|\n|\n\nPassword\n\n|\n\nEnter the password you use to log into your Eloqua account.\n\n|\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\u00a0Eloqua credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\u00a0Eloqua DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nDetails Pane\n\n\n This pane contains a primary\n **Report**\n menu,\u00a0along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n**Important:**\n Pulling back excessively large amounts of data may result in Eloqua disabling the user's API connection. Re-enabling the API connection could take up to a few days. Avoid this by limiting the data calls to about 15 million rows per day.\n\n\n|\n\n*Menu**\n\n|\n\n*Description**\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Eloqua Report\n  |\n\nSelect the Eloqua report you want to run.
