Intro
-------


 Eloqua Corp. is a marketing automation SaaS company which develops automated marketing and demand generation software and services for business-to-business marketers. You can use Domo’s Eloqua connector to compile reports on marketing statistics such as contacts, emails opened, website visits, subscribes and unsubscribes, and so on. To learn more about the Eloqua API, visit their page (

https://community.oracle.com/community/topliners/code-it

).

The Eloqua connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.

You connect to your Eloqua account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Eloqua connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

Best Practices
----------------


* Set your "Contacts" report to
 **Replace**
 , not
 **Append**
 (as "Contacts" may change over time).
* You may need to make recursive DataFlow if you need a historical record of your contacts. For more information, see

Creating a Recursive/Snapshot Magic ETL DataFlow

.
* For the "Activities" report, set your connector to pull a full history, then reconfigure to do a daily Append (this will let you keep your historical data and move forward and diminish runtime).
* If you need to join "Activities" to "Contacts" reports ("Form Submits," "Email Sends," "Email Click-throughs," and "Email Opens"), join on the "CONTACT ID" and to the "ID" fields.
* For subscribes, unsubscribes, and bouncebacks, join on "EMAIL ADDRESS."


 Prerequisites
----------------


 To connect to your Eloqua account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:


* The username for your Eloqua account
* The password for your Eloqua account
* The company name associated with your Eloqua account

 **Scheduling**
 and

 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

Credentials Pane


 This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Eloqua account. The following table describes what is needed for each field:

###

Details Pane

**Important:**
 Pulling back excessively large amounts of data may result in Eloqua disabling the user's API connection. Re-enabling the API connection could take up to a few days. Avoid this by limiting the data calls to about 15 million rows per day.
