This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Okta connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Okta account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The domain for your company Okta\u00a0instance (e.g.\n\n\n okta.mycompany.com\n\n\n ).\n* An Okta API token. For information about obtaining a token, see\n\nhttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/...g\\_a\\_token.html\n\n.\n\nConnecting to Your Okta Account\n---------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Okta Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to your Okta account.

For information about obtaining a token, see\n\nhttps://developer.okta.com/docs/api/...g\\_a\\_token.html\n\n.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Okta credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Okta DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains a primary\n **Reports**\n menu, along with various other menus which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Report\n  |\n Select the Okta report you want to run.\u00a0The following reports are available:\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Applications (Apps)\n  |\n Returns a list of Okta-enabled apps added to your organization.\n  |\n|\n Events\n  |\n Returns a list of events from your Okta organization system log.\n  |\n|\n Groups\n  |\n Returns a list of Okta groups in your organization.\n  |\n|\n Users\n  |\n Returns a list of Okta users in your organization.\n  |\n|\n Zones\n  |\n Returns a list of zones.\n  |\n\n|\n|\n Search Term (Optional)\n  |\n Enter the term you want to return data for in your \"Groups\" report.\n  |\n|\n Published Start Date\n  |\n Select the start date for your \"Events\" report.
