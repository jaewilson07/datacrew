These charts are similar to\n\nhigh-low charts\n\nbut are more complex, requiring two additional columns. For any given category, a graphic is shown consisting of a box with lines protruding from the top and bottom, hence the name \"candlestick.\" As in a high-low chart, the ends of the lines represent the high and low prices for the stock respectively. The top and bottom boundaries of the box represent the opening and closing prices of the stock. If the opening price of the stock is\n *lower*\n than the closing price (that is, the stock gained value), the graphic appears green. If the opening price is\n *higher*\n than the closing price (that is, the stock decreased in value), the graphic appears red.\n\n\n Powering candlestick charts\n-----------------------------\n\nCandlestick charts require five columns or rows of data from your DataSet\u2014a category column or row containing the name of each stock or the dates if you are showing a time progression for a single stock; and four columns or rows with the values. One of the columns or rows contains low values for the stocks or dates; one contains closing values; one contains opening values; and one contains high values. For information about value, category, and series data, see\n\nUnderstanding Chart Data\n\n.\n\n\n In the Analyzer, you choose the columns containing the data for your candlestick chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see\n\nApplying DataSet Columns to Your Chart\n\n.\n\n\n For more information about formatting charts in the Analyzer, see\n\nKPI Card Building Part 2: The Analyzer\n\n.\n\n\n The following graphic shows you how the data from the category and value columns in a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a candlestick chart:\n\nCustomizing candlestick charts\n--------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a candlestick chart by editing its\n **Chart Properties**\n . For information about all chart properties, see\n\nChart Properties\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043427993\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004758\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nCandlestick Chart\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,783\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:29 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "candlestick_chart", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "visualization_cards", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoNGAS"}, {"text": "chart_types", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoeGAC"}]}
