Why is this happening and what can I do about it?\n                         \n\n                          A: Adobe Analytics OAuth has a refresh token that expires after two weeks (see\n                          \n                           Adobe documentation\n                          \n\n\n                          for details.) This causes Adobe OAuth to no longer authenticate after two weeks. This is an Adobe limitation. Older datasets use WSSE authentication (Username:Company, Password), but Adobe has deprecated WSSE authentication.
