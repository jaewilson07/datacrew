In other words, a copy of the Dashboard and its contents is created that has a new name and is completely independent of the original Dashboard. Any changes you make to the new Dashboard or its Cards has no effect on the original Dashboard or Cards. This is the default behavior when using the\n **Save As**\n feature on a Dashboard.\n\n\n The second option is to use the\n **Save As**\n feature on a Dashboard to duplicate any Dashboard in Domo you have access to, while using the original Cards from the Dashboard.\u00a0In other words, a copy of the Dashboard\u00a0is created that has a new name and uses the same Cards of the original Dashboard. Any changes you make to the new Dashboard\u00a0has no effect on the original Dashboard, however any changes you make to the Cards will effect the Cards on the original Dashboard. In order to not duplicate the Cards on the Dashboard, you must uncheck the\u00a0box that reads\u00a0\"Duplicate all Cards.\"\n\n\n Any user with access to a Dashboard\u00a0can duplicate it regardless of security role; however, only those elements the user has access to will be copied. So, for example, if a Dashboard contained Cards a certain user was not able to view due to lack of access rights, those Cards would not be copied into the new Dashboard.\n\n\n When you duplicate a Dashboard, the following elements in the Dashboard are duplicated:\n\n Cards\n\n(If you check the box that reads \"Duplicate all Cards.\")\n* Card sizes\n* Filters built into Cards using Analyzer\n* Card Collections\n* Page-level filters\n\nThis option does\n *not*\n copy the following elements from a Dashboard:\n\n Sub-Pages\n* Temporary filters created at the Card Details level\n* Alerts on Cards\n* Scheduled reports\n* Users the original Page was being shared with\n\n\n**Video - \"Save As\" for Pages**\n\n*To duplicate a Dashboard,**\n\n. Navigate to the Dashboard you want to duplicate.\n2. In the wrench menu in the top right corner of the screen, select\n **Save As**\n .\n\n\n A\n **Save as new Dashboard**\n dialog appears.\n3. (Optional) Enter a new name for the Dashboard in the\n **New Dashboard title**\n field.\n4. (Conditional) If you do not want to duplicate the Cards (so that the new Dashboard uses the original Cards) uncheck the box that reads \"Duplicate all Cards.\"\n\n\n**Note:**\n The default behavior is the \"Duplicate all Cards\" box is checked.\n5. (Conditional) If you want to open the new Page after you save, check the box that reads \"Go to new Page when done.\"\n6.
