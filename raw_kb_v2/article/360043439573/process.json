A connector pulls data from a data source and makes it accessible inside\u00a0Domo. Connectors can be set up to pull data on a schedule and append or replace the existing content from that data source.\n                       \n\n                        To support data sources that are not available in Domo\u2019s current catalog of connectors, Domo has created an intuitive web-based\u00a0Connector Dev Studio\u00a0for building custom connectors. The connector development process leverages the JavaScript language in conjunction with added convenience methods. If you are familiar with JavaScript, it is possible to build a connector now.\n                       \n\n                        Domo's Connector\u00a0Dev Studio\u00a0utilizes an intuitive four-step process, as follows:\n                       \n\n\n\n                          You upload images for thumbnails to represent this connector.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          You configure your user authentication.\u00a0Available options\u00a0include\n                          \n                           None\n                          \n                          (for public data sources),\n                          \n                           Username and Password\n                          \n                          ,\n                          \n                           API Key\n                          \n                          ,\u00a0and\n                          \n                           OAuth 2.0\n                          \n                          . Once you have set up your user authentication, you can test it to make sure it works correctly.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          You configure\u00a0the reports that users will be\u00a0able to build using your connector.\n                         \n\n\n\n                          You define how the data is processed by adding your own data processing script. You can\u00a0enter a test query to see a preview of a report.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        Two sample connectors are provided in the\u00a0Connector Dev Studio\u00a0to help get you started.\n                       \n\n                        Domo APIs\n                       \n\n                        Domo Application Program Interfaces (APIs)\u00a0make it easier to administer your data and users, giving you the power and flexibility to get the most out of Domo. The following APIs are available:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Authentication\n                          \n                          . We're all about protecting your data. That's why in order to access your Domo instance through an API, you'll\u00a0need to authenticate. Domo uses\u00a0OAuth 2.0 as an authentication framework, and you can get authentication tokens easily via the developer portal.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Data\n                          \n                          . With Domo's data APIs you can\u00a0create DataSets, list all DataSets, read or update metadata for a specified\u00a0DataSet, delete a DataSet, or push or pull data to/from a specified DataSet.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                           Users\n                          \n                          . User APIs allow you to manage users in your Domo instance. You can create users, get information about a user, list all users, update information for a user, or delete a user.\n                         \n\n\n\n                        New\u00a0iOS App\n                       \n\n                        Domo has been hyper-focused on the modern business executive since we began. That person is not tied down to a desk, they are often on the move. In February we released our new Mobile Web experience to provide a mobile optimized experience for iOS and Android users in a mobile browser.\n                       \n\n                        We are now releasing a new native iOS app.\u00a0We have been crazy hard at work creating this amazing new app. We went to the drawing board with the goals of creating an amazing design on top of a faster, more intuitive experience. With this app you get the same new features we introduced with Mobile Web, such as filtering cards through Analyzer and support for Publication Groups, and we are introducing an innovative Home experience. With Home, you can see trending content, personalize your daily hotlist of critical content, and discover new people or new cards as they are created or shared with you.\n                       \n\n                        The new app is available in the Apple App Store now!
