 Anaplan is a cloud-based business modeling and planning platform for sales, operations and finance.


 Use Domo's Anaplan connector to return data you have created as an export in the Anaplan user interface. For more information about the Anaplan API, visit their website. (

https://docs.anaplan.apiary.io/

)


 You connect to your Anaplan account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Anaplan connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.


 Prerequisites
----------------


 To connect to your Anaplan account and create a DataSet, you must have the username and password for your Anaplan account. You must also have an export file set up in Anaplan, and you must know the workspace and model in which the file is located. For information about creating an export file, see

Setting Up an Export in Anaplan

.

 Setting Up an Export in Anaplan
---------------------------------

Follow the instructions in this section to create a file for export in Anaplan. Files set up for export can then be pulled into Domo as DataSets.


**Note:**
 You must have full access in Anaplan to do this. Otherwise the export cannot be saved as an "export definition" so it will not appear in the
 **File**
 menu in the
 **Details**
 pane for the Anaplan connector.


**To set up a file for export in Anaplan,**

. In Anaplan, open the module or list you want to export from by doing the following:

1. Click the Gear icon.
	2. Click
	 **Modules**
	 .
	3. Click the module where your file is located.
	4. Click
	 **Open**
	 at the top of the screen.
2. Click
 **Data**
 at the top of the screen.
3. Click
 **Export**
 .
4. Choose the desired export format.


 It is recommended you select
 **CSV**
 as the file type and
 **Tabular Single Column**
 as the layout, and that you check the box for
 **Export all line items while omitting empty rows**
 .
5. Check the box for
 **Save Export Definition**
 .
6. Name your export.


 This is the name that appears in the
 **File**
 menu in the
 **Details**
 pane for the Anaplan connector.
7. Click
 **Run Export**
 .
