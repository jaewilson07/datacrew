Bitly is a URL-shortening, bookmarking service and link-sharing platform.  To learn more about the Bitly API, visit their website (

https://dev.bitly.com/v4\_documentation.html

).


 The Bitly connector is a "Cloud App" connector, meaning it retrieves data stored in the cloud. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Cloud App connectors by clicking
 **Cloud App**
 in the toolbar at the top of the window.


 You connect to your Bitly account in the

Data Center

. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Bitly connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

Prerequisites
---------------

To connect to your Bitly account and create a DataSet, you must provide credentials for Bitly, Facebook, or Twitter.


 Connecting to Your Bitly Account
----------------------------------

This section enumerates the options in the
 **Credentials**
 and
 **Details**
 panes in the Bitly Connector page. The components of the other panes in this page,
 **Scheduling**
 and
 **Name & Describe Your DataSet**
 , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in

Adding a DataSet Using a Data Connector

.

##
 Credentials Pane

The Domo Bitly connector uses OAuth to connect, so there is no need to enter credentials within Domo. Click
 **Connect**
 (or select
 **Add Account**
 if you have existing Bitly accounts in Domo) to open the Bitly OAuth screen where you can sign in to Bitly using Bitly, Facebook, or Twitter credentials.


 Once you have entered valid Bitly credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Bitly DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the
 **Accounts**
 tab in the

Data Center

. For more information about this tab, see

Managing User Accounts for Connectors

.

##
 Details Pane

This pane contains a primary
 **Report**
 menu, along with various other menus and fields which may or may not appear depending on the report type you select.
