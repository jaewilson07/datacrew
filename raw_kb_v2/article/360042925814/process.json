You can\u00a0be notified\u00a0about the following kinds of events:\n\n Triggered Alerts on Visualization Cards and DataSets.\u00a0You can configure Alerts to be sent instantly or in daily or weekly\u00a0summary emails (emails listing all triggered Alerts within the specified time frame).\u00a0For more information about configuring Alerts, see\n\nCreating an Alert for a DataSet\n\n.\n* Non-Alert events such as someone @-mentioning you in Buzz, sharing a Card or Page with you, assigning a task to you, etc. Messages sent to you for these kinds of events are called\n *Notifications*\n and are sent immediately. You can configure these to be sent via email, SMS, Domo Mobile, and/or pop-up messages on your computer. For more information about Notifications, see\n\nReceiving and Viewing Notifications\n\n.\n\nYou can configure Notification and Alert settings in the Settings screen.\u00a0The screen contains tabs for General settings, Notifications, Instant Alerts, Daily Alerts, and Weekly Alerts,\u00a0and the options are different for each tab. For example,\u00a0you\u00a0configure\u00a0Buzz Notification settings in the\n **Notifications**\n tab.\n\n*Video - Managing Alerts and Notifications**\n\nGeneral\n---------\n\nIn the\n **General**\n tab you can configure a number of general settings for your Domo instance, including:\n\n Changing your password\n* Enabling multi-factor verification\n* Changing your time zone\n* General Buzz settings, as follows:\n\n+ **Disabling conversation auto-switching when you navigate**\n\t . By default, when you navigate to different items in Domo, the open Buzz conversation automatically updates to reflect the newly selected item. For example, if you were on the \"Marketing\" Page, a conversation specific to that Page would be open in Buzz. If you then clicked on the \"Marketing Reach\" Card, the conversation for \"Marketing Reach\" would open instead. If you check this box, new conversations do not appear when you navigate.\n\t+ **Include thread conversations in the Buzz menu**\n\t . If you select this option, the Buzz menu shows dropdown arrows for all conversation threads. You can click an arrow to see the thread names. You can then click a thread name to open the thread in Buzz.\n\t+ **Send emails even if you are logged in and active**\n\t . By default Domo does not send you Notification emails if you are logged in; however, you can check this box if you want to receive emails anyway.\n\t+ **Automatically remove conversations from your Buzz menu**\n\t . Here you can choose how long inactive conversations remain in your Inbox before being removed. If you choose\n\t **Never**\n\t , conversations are never removed due to inactivity. Note that when conversations are removed, they are\n\t *not*\n\t permanently removed from Domo; they are simply removed from your Inbox view.\n\n\n\t For more information about Buzz, see\n\n Buzz\n\n .\n\n*To configure general settings,**\n\n. Click your user profile photo\n\n, then click\n\n.\n2. Your user Settings page opens, with the\n **General**\n tab selected by default.\n3. Configure your settings as desired.\n\nNotifications\n---------------\n\nYou can set delivery options for all of the following kinds of Notifications in the\n **Notifications**\n tab in the Settings screen:\n\n Someone @-mentioning you in\u00a0a\u00a0Buzz\u00a0conversation.\n* Any activity occurring in a Buzz conversation you're a member of.\n* Someone sharing a Card or Page with you.\n* Someone assigning a Task to you or updating a Task assigned to you.\n* Updating of\u00a0a Doc Card you have added as a Favorite.\n* Automatic weekly activity report (\"What's Happening in Domo?\") emails.\n\nFor all of these\u00a0Notification types, you can choose whether the Notifications are sent via pop-up messages\n\n,\u00a0email\n\n, SMS\n\n, Domo Mobile\n\n, or any combination of these.\n\n\n**To set Notifications,**\n\n. Click your user profile photo\n\n, then click\n\n.\n2. In the\n **Notifications**\n tab, enable or disable Notification settings for each Notification type or event.\n\nIn the following example, the user is notified via pop-up messages on his screen when any activity occurs in a Buzz conversation he is following; by Domo Mobile and\u00a0email\u00a0when\u00a0he is @-mentioned in a conversation; by email alone when a task is updated; and so on.\n\nIn the\n **Notifications**\n tab, you can also configure\u00a0settings\u00a0for Domo product updates and education subscriptions. You can choose to receive emails\u00a0with\u00a0educational information, product feedback, best practices, and so on.\n\n\n**To configure Domo email subscriptions,**\n\n. Mouse over your user menu\n\n, then click\n\n.\n2. In the\n **Notifications**\n tab, click\n **Manage**\n next to\n **Product Updates and Education**\n near the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n You are taken into a new window where you can configure email subscriptions.\n3. Check\u00a0or uncheck the boxes as necessary to turn subscriptions on or off.\n4. Click\n **Update**\n .\n\nAlerts\n--------\n\nThere are three Alerts tabs in the\u00a0Manage Notifications & Alerts screen:\n **Instant Alerts**\n ,\n **Daily Alerts**\n , and\n **Weekly Alerts**\n .\u00a0Instant Alert Notifications are sent instantly to email, SMS, or Domo Mobile when those Alerts are triggered. Daily and weekly Alert Notifications are sent to your email as summaries of Alerts that were triggered during a given day or week, respectively. For daily Alert Notifications, you can set the time when the summary email is sent each day; for weekly Alert Notifications, you can set both the day and time when the email is sent.\n\n\n**Tip**\n : You can also configure Alert settings in the\n **Settings**\n screen in the Alert Center. The options in this screen are same as those of the\n\n*Instant Alerts**\n ,\n **Daily Alerts**\n , and\n **Weekly Alerts**\n tabs in the Manage Notifications & Alerts screen.\n\nWhen you create or follow an Alert, you are prompted to select whether you want to receive immediate, daily, or weekly Notifications, or any combination of these. In the Manage Notifications & Alerts screen, Alerts appear in the tabs corresponding to the options you've selected. For example, if you create an Alert then select\n **Daily**\n as the Notification option, the Alert appears in the\n **Daily Alerts**\n tab. You can change these settings in the Manage Notifications & Alerts screen by clicking\n **Following**\n for the Alert you want to change and selecting the desired options. If you uncheck all of the options in this screen, the Alert disappears from the Manage Notifications & Alerts screen. To restore the Alert to the screen, you must locate it in the Alert Center, click\n **Following**\n , and check the desired boxes.\n\n\n For more information about creating Alerts, see\n\nCreating a Custom Alert for a KPI Card\n\n.
