This is an excellent way to share your Domo data with others in your company who may not have access to Domo.\n                       \n\n                        You can choose which Card components you want to import; for example, for a given chart Card you could import just the chart, the summary number, last update date, etc., or you could import all of these. You can also use the Word plugin to import DataSets or portions of DataSets into Word through the use of \"query tables.\" These are subsets of DataSets or single values you pull into Word based on aggregates, filters, limits, etc. Once you have pulled your Domo data into Word, you can refresh it at any time with the click of a button.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Each \"AccountName\" row has its own unique values. For example, the account called \"Parker, Inc.\" has an \"OpportunityAmount\" of 9,125.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            If the user then selects \"AccountIndustry\" as the group by column, all of the like rows under \"Account Industry\" are combined, and all other columns are aggregated.\u00a0This is shown in the following screenshot. Note that the \"AccountName\" column is given an aggregation of COUNT because the items in that column were strings, e.g.\u00a0there were 555 accounts with an \"AccountIndustry\" of \"Consumer Services.\" \"OpportunityAmount,\" on the other hand, contained values, which can be summed to yield totals for each account industry.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            Each data type has a default aggregation when grouping. Strings are counted, values are summed, and dates receive an aggregation of MIN (meaning the earliest date is shown). Though there is no way to change the aggregation for a column, if you want to see a particular column aggregated differently, you can do so by adding an aggregation using the menus on the right side of the tab. For example, if the user in the previous example wants to show the average \"OpportunityAmount\" for each industry, he can do so by choosing \"OpportunityAmount\" as the column to be aggregated and AVERAGE as the aggregation type. This is shown in the following screenshot, in which a new \"OpportunityAmount (AVG)\" column has been added.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n                            You can add additional groupings and aggregations by clicking\n                            \n                             Add a Group By\n                            \n                            and\n                            \n                             Add an aggregation\n                            \n                            , respectively.\n                            \n\n                            Be aware that you can only add new aggregation columns in this way after specifying a grouping. If you add an aggregation without first doing a grouping, the data in your DataSet is consolidated into a single value, as explained in the next step.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n                          (Optional) To aggregate your DataSet data into a single value (which is only possible if you haven't grouped columns as explained in step 5):\n                         \n\n\n\n                            Click the\n                            \n                             Group & Aggregate\n                            \n                            tab.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            In the first menu on the right\u00a0side of the tab, select the column you want to aggregate.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            In the second menu on the right side of the tab, select the desired aggregation.\n                            \n                            For best results, choose \"COUNT\" or \"DISTINCT COUNT\" for string columns; \"SUM,\" \"MIN,\" \"MAX,\" or \"AVERAGE\" for data columns; and \"MIN\" or \"MAX\" for date columns.\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Click\n                            \n                             R\n                            \n\n                             efresh\n                            \n                            to show the changes in the query table.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Note:\n                                \n                                When you aggregate to yield a single value in this way, the\n                                \n                                 Column\n                                \n                                and\n                                \n                                 Order\n                                \n                                tabs disappear.
