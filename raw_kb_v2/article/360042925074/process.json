You do this by building a U.S. State map or a U.S. County map. These\u00a0are nearly the same, with one important difference. U.S. County maps show County data on the\n                        \n                         national\n                        \n                        level\u2014that is, your County data appears on a map of the entire United States (though you can add a\n                        \n                         drilldown\n                        \n                        allowing users to jump to individual states). U.S. State maps, on the other hand, automatically zoom in on the State indicated in your DataSet, allowing you to build maps for individual States.\n                       \n\n                        Both U.S. State and U.S. County maps require a column or row containing the FIPS codes representing each County and another containing the values for each such County. A FIPS code is a five-digit number that identifies Counties and County equivalents in the United States, certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated States. The first two digits are the FIPS State code and the last three are the County code within the State or possession. For example, the FIPS State code for Florida is 12, and the FIPS County code for Miami-Dade County is 086, so to represent Miami-Dade County in your DataSet you would use the number \"12086.\"\n                       \n\n                        You can find FIPS codes for any U.S. county by setting up the Domo Dimensions Connector using the following steps:\n                       \n\n\n                         Navigate to the\n                         \n                          Appstore\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         Type\n                         \n                          Domo Dimensions\n                         \n                         into the Search bar.\n                        \n\n                         Select the Domo Dimensions Connector.\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n                         Click\n                         \n                          Get the data\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         Select the\n                         \n                          zips_to_fips_latest.csv\n                         \n                         file.\n                        \n\n                         Click\n                         \n                          Next\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         Name the DataSet.\n                        \n\n                         Click\n                         \n                          Save\n                         \n                         .\n                        \n\n                         Join the Domo Dimensions DataSet you just created to your data on the Zip column.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Tip:\n                            \n\n                           In Domo, maps are generated based on the existing data you provide. When building a U.S. State map, you can use ZIP codes instead of FIPS codes. Your map will then automatically switch to a ZIP code-level map. If a\n                           \n                            column name includes \"st\" (short for \"state\") the state-level map will load. If\n                           \n\n                            the column name in the ETL is \"zip2fip,\" the zipcode-level map will load.\n                            \n                             When using the US counties map, you can use either ZIP codes or FIPS codes in the county selector. Domo will try and match FIPS or ZIPS by matching column name clues like \"Zip\" or \"zip code\". It will try \"FIPS\" or \"county\" for the county column name.\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        If you want to build a U.S. State map and your DataSet includes information for multiple States, you can select the State you want to show by\n                        \n                         applying a filter\n                        \n                        .\n                       \n\n                        Values in your U.S. State or U.S. County map are represented by varying shades of color, each of which corresponds to a specific range. Ranges are determined automatically based on the distribution of values in your DataSet and are represented by a legend, which is automatically included beside the map.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           When multiple instances of a single region occur in a DataSet, the values for that region are summed to show a single value for the region in the map. For example, if your DataSet contained three rows for \"Georgia,\" the values for the rows would be summed, and the Georgia region in the map would show the total value.

In the example at right, the only States with data are Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, so the map zooms on them automatically. This option will not work if all of the regions in your map with data are not adjacent. For example, if the map at right showed Oregon as having data, the auto-zoom would not work because Oregon is not adjacent to any of the other States with data.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            General> Hide No Data Items\n                           \n\n\n\n                            Hides all items in your map without data.
