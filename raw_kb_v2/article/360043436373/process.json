Domo's AmazonS3 AssumeRole Connector allows you to pull data from S3 bucket using\u00a0AssumeRole\u00a0authentication. To learn more about the Amazon S3 API, visit their page (\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/...I/Welcome.html\n\n).\n\n\n The Amazon S3 AssumeRole connector is a \"File\" connector, meaning it retrieves files and outputs them to Domo. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other File connectors by clicking\n **File**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n You connect to your Amazon S3 account in the Data Center. This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the Amazon S3 connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n**Primary Use Cases**\n |\n This connector is an excellent choice for retrieving flat files when APIs are not an option.\n  |\n|\n**Primary Metrics**\n |\n N/A\n  |\n|\n**Primary Company Roles**\n | * Data specialists\n* Marketing roles\n* Finance roles\n* Anyone who has data stored in S3\n |\n|\n**Average Implementation Time**\n |\n Less than an hour if you have the correct file types in S3.\n  |\n|\n**Ease of Use (on a 1-to-10 scale with 1 being easiest)**\n |\n 4\n  |\n\nBest Practices\n----------------\n\nUnderstanding the data stored in S3 and its relation to other S3 databases will be a huge asset in using this connector.\n\n\n Prerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to your Amazon S3 account and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.\n* The identifier for the assumed role session. You will need to set up a trust policy. This is described in continuation.\n* The unique identifier used by third parties when assuming roles in their customers' accounts.\n* The name of the Amazon S3 bucket you want to pull data from.\n\n\n###\n Trust policy configuration\n\nThe trust policy for the role session identifier should look as follows:\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\n\n \"Principal\": {\n\n\n \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::*accountId*:root\"\n\n\n },\n\n\n \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n\n\n \"Condition\": {\n\n\n \"StringEquals\": {\n\n\n \"sts:ExternalId\": \"*customer externalID*\"\n\n\n }\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n\n Account IDs for Domo environments are as follows:\n\n US: 339405024189\n* AU: 010251424122\n* EMEA: 687132894031\n* JP: 622384692065\n* CA:\n\n710710207408\n\nSo\u00a0if you wanted to grant access to Australia-based user \"myIAMuser123,\" who has an account ID of \"46822464880681,\"\u00a0the trust policy would look like this:\n\n\n`{\n\n\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\n\n \"Principal\": {\n\n\n \"AWS\": \" arn:aws:iam::46822464880681:user/myIAMuser123 \"\n\n\n },\n\n\n \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n\n\n \"Condition\": {\n\n\n \"StringEquals\": {\n\n\n \"sts:ExternalId\": \"010251424122\"\n\n\n }\n\n\n }\n\n\n }`\n\n\n Connecting to an Amazon S3 Bucket\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the Amazon S3 AssumedRole Connector page.\u00a0The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\n\n This pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to an Amazon S3 bucket. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\n\n|\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Role ARN\n  |\n Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role you want to assume.\n  |\n|\n Role Session Name\n  |\n Enter the identifier for the assumed role session.\n  |\n|\n External ID\n  |\n Enter the unique identifier used by third parties when assuming roles in their customers' accounts.\n  |\n|\n Bucket\n  |\n Enter the Amazon S3 Bucket you want to pull files from.\n  |\n|\n Region\n  |\n Select the S3 Bucket Region where your file is located.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid Amazon S3 credentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new Amazon S3 AssumedRole DataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nThis pane contains various menus for locating and configuring the file you want to pull into Domo.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n File Type to Import\n  |\n Select the type of file you want to import into Domo, either CSV, JSON, TSV, TXT, XML, XLS, or XLSX.\n  |\n|\n Does Your Filename Have an Extension?\n  |\n Select\n **Yes**\n if the filename ends with the supported file type extension; otherwise select\n **No**\n .\n  |\n|\n How Would You Like to Choose Your Filename?\n  |\n Select how you want Domo to identify your file.

Be sure to check the name for accidental spaces. If this field is left blank, the first sheet of the workbook will be used.\n  |\n|\n File Password (Conditional)\n  |\n If your Excel file is password-protected, enter the file password.\n  |\n|\n Layout\n  |\n Select the layout of your Excel file. The following options are available:\n * **Column as Header**\n . Indicates that your Excel data uses a column-based layout (i.e. each column has a header).\n* **Row as Header**\n . Indicates that your Excel data uses a row-based layout (i.e. each row has a header).\n* **Cross Tab**\n . Indicates that your Excel data uses a cross-tab (pivot) layout.\n* **Raw**\n .

For example:\n\nA3:F20\n\n|\n|\n Header Start Row\u00a0(Advanced only) (optional)\n  |\n Enter the header row number. If you do not enter a number, the first row is considered the header row.\n  |\n|\n Data Start Row\u00a0(Advanced only)\u00a0(optional)\n  |\n Enter the starting data row number. If you do not enter a number, the first row after the header row is considered the starting row.\n  |\n|\n Footer Rows to Skip\u00a0(Advanced only)\u00a0(optional)\n  |\n If there are one or more rows at the bottom of the file you do not want to import, enter the number of rows to skip.\n  |\n|\n Date Format (Advanced only)\u00a0(optional)\n  |\n Select the date format used in the Excel data.

If you select\n **Skip blank rows**\n , the file is processed as normal without the blank rows. If you select\n **Stop at the first blank row**\n , everything is pulled up until the first blank row.\n  |\n|\n Empty Column Headers (Advanced only)\u00a0(optional)\n  |\n Select the desired outcome if empty column headers are encountered in the Excel. If you select\n **Add**\n**blank columns**\n , new columns are generated with default names applied.

If your dataset has this error, you should check that the Quote Character in the Details section is correct.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043436373\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003950\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nAmazon S3 AssumeRole Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,966\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "amazon_s3_assumerole_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "file_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaowGAC"}]}
