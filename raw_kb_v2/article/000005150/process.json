With\u00a0Subset Processing, you can choose to load only the batches updated since the last successful execution or you can specify the batches to be loaded based on their creation date or partition name.\u00a0You can customize your approach to your organization's specific needs.

The graphic below illustrates\n                        \n\n                        replacing and appending data with partitions.\n                       \n\n\n\n                        A common way to understand partitions is to think of\u00a0an encyclopedia\u2014a collection of books that are part of the same set, but individually different. If an update is made to one book and it is republished, you can buy a new copy of that book without replacing the entire set of books. Partitions divide your data into separate collections, or subsets, so that when you replace some data, you do not need to replace all of it. Appending data when using partitions is like buying a new volume of the encyclopedia and adding it to the end of your collection on the shelf.\n                        \n\n                        The following notes further define using the partitions:\n                       \n\n\n                         Partition key tags divide data into subsets.\n                        \n\n                         Ingestion of new data only affects the specified partitions.\n                        \n\n                         Accessing and updating only the necessary data partitions makes the process faster and more efficient.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                        Partition Best Practices\n                       \n\n                        A good partition needs to be large enough to take advantage of the enhanced processing speed that partitioning offers, but also\n                        \n\n                        granular enough to meet your specific needs.\n                        \n\n                        For most situations, a date-based, day-level partition strikes a good balance between these alternatives. However, if you need to keep more than five year's worth\u00a0of\u00a0day-based partitions in a single DataSet, you may want to consider using a week-level or month-level partition instead.\n                        \n\n                        Some organizations need partitions that are more granular than day level. If that is the case for your organization, you can create a custom partition by combining two or more columns in your DataFlow. For example, if you have eight store locations, you might want to create a partition that combines the store ID and the date.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Important:\n                           \n                           There is a 1500-partition limit for each DataSet. If you create too many partitions, you may reach this limit and experience problems. In the example from the previous paragraph, if you create a partition key using store ID + date, you can only store 187 day's worth\u00a0of data. (1500 partitions divided by 8 stores.)\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Configure Initial Data Processing\n                       \n\n                        Magic ETL provides three data selection methods when configuring your input DataSet for a DataFlow: All, New, and Filter by batch.

This means that the data is split into different partitions based on the date, which allows the formula to use date-related functions to filter the data.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                        The formula creates a filter that compares the partition name (which is a date) to the current date. If the current date is the first day of the month, the filter allows all partitions from the past year to pass through. If the current date is any other day of the month, the filter only allows the last 30 day's worth of partitions to pass through.\n                       \n\n                        This filtering strategy enables you to process less data every day while still maintaining a full year's worth of data one time per month. You can use this approach in various scenarios, and we recommend that you experiment\n                        \n\n                        with it.\n                       \nDATE(batch.name) >= CURRENT_DATE() \u2013 (CASE WHEN DAYOFMONTH(CURRENT_DATE()) = 1 THEN 365 ELSE 30 END)\n\n\n\n\n                        Configure Update Method\n                       \n\n                        The following data update methods are available in Magic ETL:\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                           Update Method\n                          \n\n                           Description\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                           Replace\n                          \n\n                           Each execution replaces the output DataSet's contents with its latest results.\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Append\n                          \n\n                           Each execution appends its results to the output DataSet as a new batch.\n                          \n\n\n\n                           Partition\n                          \n\n                           Each execution groups rows into batches according to a name, which is the value of a specific column.
