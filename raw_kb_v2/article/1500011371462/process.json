Domo's platform offers the best in class analytics and reporting solution for MongoDB users\u2014helping organizations monitor, visualize, and report complex datasets easily. You can use Domo's MongoDB Partition connector to pull data from a MongoDB collection and compile custom reports. You indicate the data you want by inputting JSON query filter. For more information about the MongoDB API, go to\n\nhttp://api.mongodb.org/\n\n.\u00a0Easily combine your MongoDB data with data from numerous other systems, allowing you to combine and transform your data and make it all available for user self-service.\n\n\n The MongoDB\u00a0Partition\u00a0Connector is a \"Database\" connector, meaning it retrieves data from a database using a query. In the Data Center, you can access the connector page for this and other Database connectors by clicking\n **Database**\n in the toolbar at the top of the window.\n\n\n This topic discusses the fields and menus that are specific to the MongoDB Partition Connector user interface. General information for adding DataSets, setting update schedules, and editing DataSet information is discussed in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n*Important:**\n An SSL connection is required for this connector to work.\n\nPrerequisites\n---------------\n\nTo connect to a\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0collection and create a DataSet, you must have the following:\n\n The username and password you use to log into your\u00a0MongoDB database\n* The host name for the database server (e.g.\n\ndb.company.com\n\n).\n* The port number for the database\n* The database name\n* The CA certificate text or URL path is required\n *only*\n if you select\n **Certificate\u00a0String**\n or\n **URL Path**\n ,\u00a0respectively, in the\n **Certificate\u00a0Format**\n menu.\n* An SSL connection\n\n\n**Note:**\n MongoDB uses \"admin\" as the database name to establish a connection.\n\nBefore you can connect to a MongoDB\u00a0database, you must also whitelist a number of IP addresses on your database server on the\u00a0port\u00a0you want to connect to. For the full list of IP addresses, see\n\nWhitelisting IP Addresses for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n Connecting to Your\n\nMongoDB\u00a0Collection\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n This section enumerates the options in the\n **Credentials**\n and\n **Details**\n panes in the\n\nMongoDB Partition\n\nConnector page. The components of the other panes in this page,\n **Scheduling**\n and\n **Name & Describe Your DataSet**\n , are universal across most connector types and are discussed in greater length in\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n\n###\n\nCredentials Pane\n\nThis pane contains fields for entering credentials to connect to\u00a0a collection within a MongoDB\u00a0database. The following table describes what is needed for each field:\n\nField\n\n|\n\nDescription\n\n|\n| --- | --- |\n|\n Host\n  |\n Enter the host name for the MongoDB database. Example-\n\ndb.company.com\n  |\n|\n Port\n  |\n Enter the port number for the MongoDB\u00a0database.\n  |\n|\n Database\n  |\n Enter the name of the\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0database.\n  |\n|\n Username\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0username.\n  |\n|\n Password\n  |\n Enter your\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0password.\n  |\n|\n Certificate Format\n  |\n Select\u00a0the certificate format. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n ****No Certificate****\n . If you select\n ****Certificate\u00a0String****\n , you must paste the text for your certificate in the\n ****Certificate****\n field. If you select\n ****URL Path****\n , you must enter the URL where your certificate is located in the\n ****Certificate****\n field.\n  |\n|\n Certificate\n  |\n Paste the text for your CA certificate or enter the URL where your certificate is located.\u00a0This is optional. If you do not want to include a certificate, select\n ****No Certificate****\n in the\n ****Certificate\u00a0Format****\n menu.\n  |\n\n\n Once you have entered valid\n\nMongoDB\n\ncredentials, you can use the same account any time you go to create a new\n\nMongoDB\u00a0Partition\n\nDataSet. You can manage connector accounts in the\n **Accounts**\n tab in the Data Center. For more information about this tab, see\n\nManaging User Accounts for Connectors\n\n.\n\n\n###\n Details Pane\n\nIn this pane you create a JSON query to pull data from your MongoDB collection. You can also create optional\u00a0WHERE,\u00a0SELECT,\u00a0GROUP, and\u00a0SORT\u00a0clauses, and apply the query filter to find documents in the collection.\n\n\n Menu\n  |\n Description\n  |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n How would you like to select your collection name?\n  |\n Select how would you like to get the collection name.\n  |\n|\n Select Collection Name\n  |\n Select the name of the MongoDB collection.\n  |\n|\n Enter\u00a0Collection Name\n  |\n Enter the name of the MongoDB collection.\n  |\n|\n Query Method\n  |\n Select a query method to pull data from your MongoDB collection.\n  |\n|\n Find\n  |\n A JSON Query will execute by 'Find Method'.\n  |\n|\n Aggregate\n  |\n A JSON Query will execute by 'Aggregate Method'.\n  |\n|\n JSON Query Filter\n  |\n Enter the query filter to find documents in the collection.\n  |\n|\n Limit Row\n  |\n Enter the number of rows you want to be returned.\n  |\n|\n Batch Size\n  |\n Batch size is the number of documents to be returned per batch which is used internally by the connector. Enter the batch size greater than 1.\n  |\n|\n Where Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0WHERE\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Select Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0SELECT\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Group Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0GROUP\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Sort Clause JSON\n  |\n Enter a\u00a0SORT\u00a0clause in JSON format.\n  |\n|\n Partition Column\n  |\n Enter the Partition Column name. The Partition Column should have a 'Date' data type.\n  |\n|\n Past Days\n  |\n Enter the number of past days you want to get data for. Value can be X, where X is a positive integer. Example: 30.\n  |\n\n\n###\n Other Panes\n\nFor information about the remaining sections of the connector interface, including how to configure scheduling, retry, and update options, see\n\nAdding a DataSet Using a Data Connector\n\n.\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 1500011371462\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000003959\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nMongoDB Partition Connector\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,726\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:17 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:41 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "mongodb_partition_connector", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanLGAS"}, {"text": "partition_connectors", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapAGAS"}]}
