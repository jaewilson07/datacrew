You can then edit the data in Excel just as you could with any Excel spreadsheet. You can also add data to a DataSet through the use of \"query tables.\" These are subsets of DataSets or single values you pull into Excel based on aggregates, filters, limits, etc. After editing data from a DataSet in Excel, you can upload the edited data into the same DataSet you downloaded it from, create a new Domo DataSet from this data, or upload the data to another existing DataSet.\n
