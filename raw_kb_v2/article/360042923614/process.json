When you click and hold to drag a card, it becomes a transparent \"ghost\" card so that you can see where you're moving it. When you move a card, a space opens up for you to drop the card, and the other cards reposition themselves accordingly. In this way the order of cards on the page is preserved.\n                       \n\n                        After you have changed the position of cards on a page, they remain in the same position after you refresh the page.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           If\u00a0a page has been locked, you can only move cards within the page if you are the page owner or you have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" enabled.
