When you click and hold to drag a card, it becomes a transparent \"ghost\" card so that you can see where you're moving it. When you move a card, a space opens up for you to drop the card, and the other cards reposition themselves accordingly. In this way the order of cards on the page is preserved.\n\n\n After you have changed the position of cards on a page, they remain in the same position after you refresh the page.\n\n*Note:**\n If\u00a0a page has been locked, you can only move cards within the page if you are the page owner or you have an \"Admin\" default security role or a custom role with \"Manage All Cards and Pages\" enabled. For more information about locking and unlocking content on pages, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\nIn the following screenshot, the user starts to drag the \"Sales by Date\" card. It turns into a transparent \"ghost\" card to indicate that it is being moved. In addition, an empty space opens up in the card's former location.\n\nThe user moves \"Sales by Customer\" to the bottom middle position formerly taken by the \"Profits by Region\" card. \"Profits by Region,\" \"Sales by State,\" and \"Best-Selling Products by Category\" all move to the left accordingly.\n\n\n**Video - Resizing & Rearranging Cards**\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360042923614\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004097\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nRearranging Cards on a Page\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,889\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:22 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "rearranging_cards_on_a_page", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "creating_content_in_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamoGAC"}, {"text": "card_and_dashboard_management", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanDGAS"}]}
