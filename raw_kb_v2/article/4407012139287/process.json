To obtain these files, you must download and install the SAPGUI Frontend for Windows application by following the steps below.\n\n\n Download SAPGUI for Windows\n-----------------------------\n\n\n1. Navigate to the\n\nSAP\u00a0Software Downloads Center\n\n.\n2. Select\n **Types of Software**\n >\n **Installation & Upgrades**\n >\n **Access Downloads**\n .\n\n\n The\n **Downloads**\n page opens.\n3. Select\n **By Category**\n >\n **SAP Frontend Components**\n >\n **SAP GUI FOR WINDOWS**\n , then select the latest version.\n\n\n Download the application and follow the prompts to install it on your Windows machine.\n\nConfirm Installation\n----------------------\n\nTo verify that your SAPGUI installation worked, follow the steps below.\n\n. On your\u00a0Windows machine, open the\n **Run**\n dialog.\n2. In the\n **Open**\n field, enter\u00a0\"odbcad32\", and then select\n **OK**\n .\n\n\n The\n **ODBC Data Source Administrator**\n dialog opens.\n3. In\u00a0the\n **System DSN**\n tab, find\u00a0or create\u00a0the DSN.\n4. Select\n **Configure**\n >\n **Test Connection**\n .\n\n\n**Note:**\n The\n **Test Connection**\n only works if you provide your own license key, otherwise a licensing error displays. You can either obtain a trial key from CData, or you can attach a Workbench job to this DSN and run a job preview in Workbench, in which case Workbench injects a Domo-provided license key when the job runs.\n\n\n Required Files\n----------------\n\nTo use the SAP CDATA connection tool, you must copy the following .dll files to the System32/Win32 and SysWOW64 folders on the machine running the Workbench:\n\n icudt34.dll\n* icuin34.dll\n* icuuc34.dll\n* libicudecnumber.dll\n* librfc32.dll\n* librfc32u.dll\n* libsapu16vc80.dll\n* libsapucum.dll\n* sapnwrfc.dll\n\n\n**Note:**\n The .dll files above are provided by SAP. Domo cannot distribute them due to SAPs licensing restrictions.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 4407012139287\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004872\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nConfigure the CData Driver for SAP in Workbench 5.1\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,732\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:32 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:40 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "configure_the_cdata_driver_for_sap_in_workbench_51", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "connecting_data_to_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZammGAC"}, {"text": "workbench", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZaoPGAS"}, {"text": "workbench_51", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZapUGAS"}]}
