If you try to remove the protection for any column (by unchecking it) the Domo Workbench will give you a warning. Unchecking the Protect column checkbox will allow schema changes to be made for that specific column.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             Important:\n                            \n                            Unprotected columns can be changed and deleted, which may break content in Domo.\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         The Protect column provides you a control to protect or unprotect all columns with a single click. Select the checkbox next to the column header (Protect) to protect all your columns at once.

Select the plugins you would like to install by choosing the checkbox next to them on install.\n                       \n\n                        Do I have to use the plugins to connect to my database?\n                       \n\n                        It is not mandatory to use the plugins. You can still use the generic plugins to connect to your database.\n                       \n\n                        What are the benefits of using the database specific plugins?\n                       \n\n                        Workbench will read the datatypes directly from the database meaning you do not have to worry that Workbench will interpret the data type differently than your database.\n                       \n\n                        What DataSets can I take over?\n                       \n\n                        Any DataSets that were created by a Connector and for which you have Edit permissions or above.\n                       \n\n                        Can I transfer it back to the Connector if I change my mind?\n                       \n\n                        No, moving DataSets from Workbench 5.1 back to a Connector is currently not supported.\n                       \n\n                        Will the DataSet automatically start using the schedule from the Connector?\n                       \n\n                        No, you will need to set up a new job in Workbench 5.1 and set up the schedule you would like to use in Workbench 5.1, and then choose the DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        What if I accidentally bulk delete multiple jobs?\n                       \n\n                        Workbench 5.1 has added an extra confirm step so you can ensure you would like to delete DataSets. Once they have been deleted, they cannot be recovered.\n                       \n\n                        Have any actions been excluded from the Bulk Action menu?\n                       \n\n                        No, any actions that can be configured on a job can also be adjusted using the Bulk Actions menu.\n                       \n\n                        Can I edit DataSets from different providers at the same time?\n                       \n\n                        For some Bulk Action options, Workbench 5.1 will ask you to choose which provider jobs you would like to update first because the configuration steps are often different between providers.\n                       \n\n                        Will I be able to block all schema changes?\n                       \n\n                        Yes, when this option is selected, absolutely no schema changes will be allowed and Workbench 5.1 will automatically fail the job.\n                       \n\n                        Can I choose to prevent schema changes on some columns and allow them on others?\n                       \n\n                        Yes, the new protect column allows you to choose which columns will have schema protection and which ones will not. This option is not available when\n                        \n                         Block all schema changes\n                        \n                        is selected.\n                       \n\n                        If I add a new column to my DataSet will that fail the job?\n                       \n\n                        It depends, if you choose to\n                        \n                         Allow safe schema changes\n                        \n                        , Workbench 5.1 will prevent schema changes on existing columns while allowing new columns to be added to the DataSet.\n                       \n\n                        What date grains are available for partitioning?\n                       \n\n                        Partitioning will be available for all column types.\n                       \n\n                        Can I convert an existing DataSet to a partitioned DataSet?\n                       \n\n                        Partitioning is only available on new DataSets in this version. Converting to partitioned DataSets will be available in a future release.", "Preview Article": "Click here to preview", "URL Name": "360056669354", "Summary\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Briefly describe the article.
