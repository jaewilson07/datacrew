FAQ
-----


####
 What happens if I delete the owner of a DataSet?

If the owner of a DataSet is deleted, then you will be prompted to reassign those DataSets before they are deleted. The reassignment can be to another user or a group.

###
 How do group notifications work?

DataSet email notifications may send notifications to users that don't have authority on the DataSet. This is permissible as users are unable to access the DataSet.
