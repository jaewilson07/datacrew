By default, cards are medium-sized, except for Domo App Cards, which are full-sized. The reference table below shows the size options. Enlarging a card makes it easier to view all of the information in the card. Shrinking a card makes it easier to view more cards at time, but less information is visible.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note:\n                           \n                           If a dashboard has been locked, you can only resize cards if you are the dashboard owner, have an Admin default security role, or a custom role with the Manage All Cards and Pages grant enabled.\n                           \n                            I\n                           \n                           For more information about locking and unlocking content on dashboards, see\n                           \n                            Managing Custom Roles\n                           \n                           .\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Video - Resizing & Rearranging Cards\n                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Resizing All Cards on a Dashboard\n                       \n\n                        Follow the steps below to change the size of all cards on a dashboard:\n                       \n\n\n\n                        1.
