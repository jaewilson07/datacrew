By default, cards are medium-sized, except for Domo App Cards, which are full-sized. The reference table below shows the size options. Enlarging a card makes it easier to view all of the information in the card. Shrinking a card makes it easier to view more cards at time, but less information is visible.\n\n*Note:**\n If a dashboard has been locked, you can only resize cards if you are the dashboard owner, have an Admin default security role, or a custom role with the Manage All Cards and Pages grant enabled.\n\nI\n\nFor more information about locking and unlocking content on dashboards, see\n\nManaging Custom Roles\n\n.\n\n\n**Video - Resizing & Rearranging Cards**\n\nResizing All Cards on a Dashboard\n-----------------------------------\n\nFollow the steps below to change the size of all cards on a dashboard:\n\n\n 1.
