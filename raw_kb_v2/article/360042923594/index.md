Users can change the size of cards in dashboards. By default, cards are medium-sized, except for Domo App Cards, which are full-sized. The reference table below shows the size options. Enlarging a card makes it easier to view all of the information in the card. Shrinking a card makes it easier to view more cards at time, but less information is visible.

*Note:**
 If a dashboard has been locked, you can only resize cards if you are the dashboard owner, have an Admin default security role, or a custom role with the Manage All Cards and Pages grant enabled.
