It also makes is possible to navigate to all of Domo\u2019s most used features in fewer clicks, decreasing the time it takes you to perform actions in Domo and get answers. For more information, watch this\n\ndemo video\n\n.\n\n\n The new navigation will be released to all Domo customers in March\u00a02020.\u00a0Until then, all customers have the option to turn on the new navigation by going into the Admin Settings and selecting\n ****Company Settings > Feature control****\n , then switching\u00a0on the option reading \"Enable updated navigation for all users.\" (You must have Admin security privileges to do this.) This way, your organization has the freedom to make the transition whenever it is ready. Note that third-level and favorited Pages are only supported in the updated navigation, so if you switch back to the old navigation from the new navigation, these Pages won't be visible in the UI.\n\n\n Here\u2019s a highlight list of some of the most notable improvements:\n\n\n Improved UI\n-------------\n\nThe Pages menu has been moved to the left side\u00a0of the screen in a scrollable\u00a0\"Dashboards\" list. You can collapse this list by\u00a0clicking the\n\nicon, giving more space when you want to focus on important dashboard content. You can still show the list when it is in its collapsed state by mousing over the\n\nicon, or \"repin\" the list by clicking\n\n.\n\nThe list is searchable too, allowing you to quickly filter\u00a0down the list of Pages as you type.\n\nYou will also find shortcuts to your most important Domo functions now exposed at the top of the screen, giving you quicker access.\n\nThird-level Pages\n-------------------\n\nAn additional level of Page\u00a0hierarchy lets you create Subpages\u00a0of your Subpages. You have more options than ever for how you organize your Pages\u00a0to show related information.\n\n\n Favorite Pages\n----------------\n\nYou can now mark Pages as \"favorites,\"\u00a0making it easier for you to get to your most important content in Domo. You can add any Page as a\u00a0\"favorite\" Page by choosing the\n **Add to favorites**\n option in the wrench menu for the Page.\n\nOnce a Page is added as a Favorite, you can jump to it quickly by clicking\n **Favorites**\n at the top of the Pages list and selecting the Page you want to open.\n\n\n", "preview_article": "\n\nClick here to preview\n\n", "url_name": "\n\n\n 360043877854\n\n\n", "summary____________________________________________briefly_describe_the_article_the_summary_is_used_in_search_results_to_help_users_find_relevant_articles_you_can_improve_the_accuracy_of_search_results_by_including_phrases_that_your_customers_use_to_describe_this_issue_or_topic": "\n\n", "article_number": "\n\n\n 000004333\n\n\n", "archived_date": "\n\n\n", "language": "\n\n\n English\n\n\n", "primary_version": "\n\nNew Navigation Announcement\n\n", "article_total_view_count": "\n\n\n 4,914\n\n\n", "": "\n\n", "article_created_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 9:40 PM\n\n\n", "first_published_date": "\n\n\n 10/24/2022, 10:42 PM\n\n\n"}, "title": "new_navigation_announcement", "breadcrumbs": [{"text": "domo", "url": "/s/knowledge-base/"}, {"text": "getting_to_know_domo", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZamsGAC"}, {"text": "getting_started", "url": "/s/topic/0TO5w000000ZanlGAC"}]}
